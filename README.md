## Issues

### Track My Progress

You can track my progress with issues here: [Issues Board](https://gitlab.com/bencodezen/go-blog/board).

### Submit a Bug or Request

The best way would be to submit an issue on the [Issues page](https://gitlab.com/bencodezen/go-blog/issues). However, this does require a GitLab account.

My next recommendation would be to contact me directly on [Twitter](www.twitter.com/bengozen).

I would post my email here so you could directly contact as well, but I have some concerns about it getting lost since email can be a little unreliable due to the amount of noise and potenital issues (i.e., spam bots) that comes with email. You are **more than welcome** to contact me directly for my email address if you'd like to get in touch with me though!
