Embark on a near impossible journey with me, a recent college graduate with no background of Go, who will quest to become a professional Go player before the age of 30\. Here you will find all of the steps I take, my mistakes, my successes, reviews of books and equipment, along with any advice I can pass on. Good luck to all my fellow Go players. May we meet across the board someday.

**My Rank Graph**

If you'd like to play go with me, you can find me on my screenname (bengozen) at the following servers:

*   Kiseido Go Server (KGS)
*   Dragon Go Server (DGS)
*   Nova Go Server (NGS)
*   Tygem
*   Kaya
*   WBaduk
*   GoShrine
*   IGS-PandaNet
*   Online-Go
I'm primarily on KGS, DGS, and NGS; but I'm open to playing on other servers if you would like to play with me! In addition, I'm happy to announce that I have joined GoTeachingLadder as an official reviewer and will be happy to review your games!

You can also find me on [Twitter](http://www.twitter.com/bengozen) and [YouTube](http://www.youtube.com/bengozen)!
