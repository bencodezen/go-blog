Weekly Go Wednesday, Issue #

--FEATURED IMAGE: Toriko and Komatsu at Shokukin Temple--

**Introduction**

Recently I began watching an anime called Toriko. I've read the manga numerous times already, but I happened to come across it when I was growing around my Hulu Plus and thought I'd start putting it on when I was eating (which should come as no surprise since the entire theme of Toriko is about the search for incredible ingredients and amazing food). For those who have read / kept up with the manga, I'm sure that the title for this post has already rung a bell. For those who haven't though, let me explain a little bit.

With most fighting type anime, the characters must undergo rigorous training as they journey to taking the next step towards getting stronger. In Toriko, the main characters Toriko and Komatsu are eventually faced with the challenge of gaining "Food Honor." Food Honor (i.e., Food Etiquette) is a philosophy where one must be in a constant state of gratification towards the food that is eaten and treating the ingredients with the utmost respect. Some of the exercises they go through include intense meditation, laboriously tedious tasks like picking up beans with a 5 meter long pair of chopsticks, and so forth.

In the world of Toriko, the ingredients have a life of their own and play a significant role in the characters' growth and development. And along the way, Toriko and Komatsu encounter a type of ingredient (called "Disappearing Cuisine") that did not show itself to people who had no etiquette towards food. In other words, those who just saw food as a means of selfish enjoyment could not see and/or eat the food.

As you watch Toriko and Komatsu undergo their training, you learn more about how their training is really centered around strengthening their focus, changing the state of mind, and eliminating "wasted movements." For example, their instructor (named Shuu) challenges Toriko to a fight. And even though Toriko has exponentially more power and experience fighting, Shuu is able to easily dodge all of his attacks because there are numerous "wasted movements." In addition, at the end of the fight, Toriko is exhausted while Shuu is barely breathing hard. This is another example of a detrimental effect of "wasted movements."

**How is any of this relevant to go?**

In the rush to become stronger, the only thing that players end up remembering from each game is simply racing to the end to see if they won or lost. And once the victory or defeat has been stashed away in their memory, the next immediate concern is on how the win or loss impacted their rank.

Who can forget that moving scene where Sai is so incredibly moved to be able to play go after "XYZ" years.

After much deliberation, I realized that something was incredibly wrong with this.

Players just rush to slap stones down on the board without even much thought. There is this disregard for each stone and being given the opportunity to make even a single move on the board.

Well after a lot of thought, I realized that this whole concept of "food honor" could actually be directly applied to go as "stone honor."

When the game is approached in such a manner, I believe that the beauty of go and all its hidden intricacies like tesuji are no different than the "Disappearing Cuisine" in the world of Toriko. If the proper time and mindset is not given to each and every move, it will always remain hidden from view and you will never be able to appreciate them nor use them in your games.

As both a player and spectator of the game, I believe that after learning about the game and sprinting off into the race to become as strong as possible, many players forget the simple delight and honor that comes with being able to place even just a single stone on the board.

**So what is Stone Honor?**

There are two parts to Stone Honor:

(1) **Mental State** - As many players have experienced, once you have gone on [tilt](http://www.bengozen.com/going-on-tilt/ "Going On Tilt"), it's very difficult to recover and you'll find yourself playing numerous disappointing games. As a result, one must start by practicing the mental state of zen if one is to achieve Stone Honor.

(2) **Gratitude to Each Stone** - Though this may sound preposterous, it is rooted in the notion that you must not take even a single stone for granted. By being able to give gratitude to each of your moves, the way you value them will ultimately result in you being able to find better moves.

Some exercises and habits that you can put into place to help you start training your Stone Honor include:

1.  **Meditation** - Even if this is just concentrating on taking deep breaths for one minute before your game, this will help work on keeping a calm mind.
2.  **Hands Off the Mouse After Every Move** - Not only will this help lower the frequency of misclicks, but this will force you to take more time to think about each move. In addition, if you take the time between each move to really appreciate each and every move, it will also improve the quality of your moves.
3.  **Close Your Eyes After Your Opponent Moves and Take One Deep Breath** - This exercise is dual-purpose: (1) By closing your eyes briefly after your opponent moves, you will be forced to re-assess the board as a whole instead of being fixated on a local position. (2) It will give you additional time to maintain your zen and appreciation of every move.
**Conclusion**

We must honor each and every move that we make. To be able to place that one stone on the board is a privilege that many no longer have. Since you are able to appreciate the beauty of this game, I urge that you take the time to reconsider your approach to the game and begin practicing that which I call "Stone Honor."
