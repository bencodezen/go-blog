Hello again everyone. It's good to be back. And yes, this time I really mean it.

I apologize for the rollercoaster back and forth of saying I was coming back and then disappearing again for some time.

# What I Was Dealing With

New job
Family situation
Moving to new state
WordPress maintenance / hacks were killing me

# Where I Left

# Where I'm Picking Back Up

As you may notice, the blog design has changed again. This time however, it's not a mere cosmetic change and nor is it one that will be as permanent as before.

I have said goodbye to WordPress and hello to Hexo*

* Many thanks goes out to Nate for pointing me in the direction of Hexo. He gave me an important nudge that really helped get the ball moving on this overdue overhaul of the blog.
