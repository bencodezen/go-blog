## Weekly Go Wednesday, Issue #48

![Hikaru no Go (S1E3) - Akira Bares His Fangs](/images/2016/10/wgw-48-masthead.jpg)

Over the last few weeks, I've been "rewatching"* Hikaru no Go so many times I'm pretty sure I'm on double digits of the number of iterations I've gone through the anime. Don't even get me started on how many times I've read the manga.

In the scene above, there is this poignant moment that I must have missed at some point; but it resonated with me in one of the recent iterations that I was watching it. In a lot of ways, it is a pivotal moment in Hikaru's first steps on his journey as he is deeply intrigued by Akira's intensity and passion for the game.

Looking back at my origin story, I can't help but laugh as I am reminded the lofty ambitions of aiming to be a professional and taking on the world. And yet, even though I've taken many detours along the way, here I am six years later still playing this game.

 And it made me ask myself the very same question: "What is go to me?"

\* _Note_: When I say rewatching, it's typically running in the background when I'm studying or sometimes I just play the audio when driving around. Haha.

### Hidden beneath the bloody battles is a serenity and peace

As most of you know, one of the aspects of go that I found particularly appealing was the atmosphere of zen that it carried. And while I have had numerous games into bloody battles where my blood boiled over captured stones, I have had also had the good fortune of experiencing glimpses of the calm serenity go can offer when all of that simply melts away.

### The journey is a never-ending one

Unlike many games where there is a clear beginning and end to your journey as a player, the desire to gain another stone is something that never ends for a go player.

With that said, I pose the same question to you:

> What is go to you?
