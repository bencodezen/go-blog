In the pursuit of gaining another stone, one of the ideas that rarely occurs to us is who we are doing this for. The most obvious answer would seem to be ourself. After all, gaining a rank only impacts oneself, no? Yet, ironically, the one thing I have found in my journey is that that is actually quite far from the truth.

The advice I received from frozen was that I should play for myself. Not to impress others. Not for the sake of others, but simply for myself. While I have not completely grasped this concept, I am starting to see why he advises so.

While go seems to be a solitary sport, it is very much a social activity and relies heavily on the interactions with others. Go is a two player game is it not?

Whether it's go, music, acting, sports, or any other interactive activity, something that we must always consider is who we are playing for.

Although some of us may not be aware of it, I speak from personal experience when I say that there is often a motive for showing off or simply impressing the audience. The viewers.

After all, how much fun would something be if you accomplished something but did not have anyone to share it with?

With that being said however, this always yields one of the most emotional aspects of go since it can be extremely pressure intensive when it comes to the people around us. After all, if you're playing for others, pressure like tournament people watching over your shoulder can really become a mental burden. And that's not even to say if you happen to be the last board playing in the round meaning EVERYONE is WATCHING YOU.

I can't say that I've mastered this completely, but I will say that during the times that I felt this zen, go is far more enjoyable since there is less pressure.

This is a rather odd concept to me. After all, I'm used to playing to compete. To show the world who is better. Or to even impress a friend. But to play for myself? Hmm... how does that work?

Maybe it's just me, but when you start to play for yourself, and not for other people, the way you approach the game is completely different.
