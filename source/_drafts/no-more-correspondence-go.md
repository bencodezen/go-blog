Correspondence go and I have always had a rollercoaster of a relationship. There were times I loved it for the fact that I could play multiple games at once and would eagerly await getting a move back from an opponent. And then there were the polar opposites when I absolutely hated it and would end up losing by time on numerous games because I would keep procrastinating my own move.

1. My thoughts are fragmented - My ideas are constantly shifting and what I want to try one day may not necessarily be the thing I want to try tomorrow. For example, I may feel like trying out a particular strategy because of something I was inspired by; but the next day, I could be inspired by something completely different and I'm now stuck with the old strategy. Not very fun for me.
2. The feedback loop is too long
3. I am constantly reminded of my mistakes

Of course, like all things, there are certainly exceptions to the rule. I'm still happy to play correspondence go with any friends / people who are unable to play a real-time game fo go with me and request me directly. Other than that though, I need to focus all my energy and time on playing live matches.

And just to ensure there is no misunderstanding, I am **not** saying that correspondence go is bad. It's just that after trying time and time again, it just never seems to synergize well with me and always causes me more frustration than necessary for something that should be enjoyable.
