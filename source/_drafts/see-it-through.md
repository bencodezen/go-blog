# See It Though

I was working through #204 of Elementary Problems on Tsumego Pro.

Another issue appeared on #216 of Elementary Problems on Tsumego Pro.

The thing is that we often just look for the right answers. Especially when it comes to software for solving tsumego, the key is that you challenge and find out why you're wrong.

The solution not only had the wrong counter-attack, but then I had to figure out whether or not I was actually right, which led to a back and forth between thinking I was right and the solution was wrong to realizing that there are actually two solutions.

IDEA: Back and forth diagrams of what I encountered.
