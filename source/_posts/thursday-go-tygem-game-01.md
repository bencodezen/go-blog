## Introduction

Welcome to my new Thursday Go Tygem series! This series is inspired by fellow go blogger Eyecatcher's [WBaduk Challenge series](http://www.truthandgo.com/?p=442 "Eyecatcher") where he posts the games from WBaduk to keep himself disciplined and force himself to review his games from there as well. As you might have guessed from the title of this series, the games featured on here will solely be from Tygem.

I'm sure some of you are wondering though, "What's the difference between this and Monday Go Meditation?"

1.  **Higher Level Commentaries** - Instead of being extremely detailed with every move, this series focuses on higher level commentary that highlights big points and any key aspects of how I thought the game went. In addition, it will abstain from any detailed explanation regarding variations in order to save on time and effort. By doing this, I am hoping that this will help speed up my process (since reviewing all my games via Monday Go Meditation is practically impossible).
2.  **Exclusively Dan Level Opponents** -  The unique kicker to this entire series is that it will consist entirely of me playing dan players on Tygem. As some of you might remember, frozensoul once gave me the challenge to exclusively play dan players on Tygem in order to get stronger. Well, your wish is granted sensei. This series is the start of me embarking on that journey.
And since this is a new series, it would be great if you could leave some feedback below to let me know whether or not I should continue with this series or if there are things I should do to improve it! Here we go!

### Game Summary

[table colwidth="50|140|375|375" colalign="center|center|center|center"]
no,Category,Good,Bad
1,Opening,**Moves 8-10**: Ignoring White's pincer to make my own enclosure and then diving in the corner felt like good timing overall.,**Move 11**: I messed up the lower left joseki due to carelessness.
2,Middle Game,**Move 45-49**: I was really proud of this sequence since I could break up White's area while counter attacking at the same time., **Move 56**: I feel I may have mishandled this crosscut fight and gave away too much to White as a result.
3,Fighting,**Move 158-160**: I was proud of myself for not backing away from the ko fight., Nothing bad as far as I can tell.
4,Endgame,My endgame felt average this game. Nothing special.,**Move 134**: Letting White get this hane was really painful.
5,Overall Reading,Overall I think I did alright. Nothing I'm particularly proud of though., **Move 100**: Didn't see that coming!
