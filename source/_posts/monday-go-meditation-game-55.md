## Introduction

So people have said my games were violent... Well a few weeks ago I finally decided to hop on IGS and check it out. I ended up losing the first couple automatches due to some rather epic blunders, but then I played this game.

What I will say about it is that if you thought my previous games were bloody.. well... I just don't know how to describe this game other than it's was the biggest massacre I've ever done with someone around my strength.

My opponent certainly ignores me at some critical points, so I end up getting away with what was most definitely overplays, but I thought you find the game entertaining, so here it is!

## **One Point Lesson**

When you're on the hunt to kill a big group, do not let your opponents distract you from the true target.
