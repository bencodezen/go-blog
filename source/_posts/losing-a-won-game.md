In my experience thus far, one of the most difficult things to swallow is losing a won game. And let me tell you, boy did I royally screw this one up.

The thing that makes this kind of loss worse is the fact that you know it's entirely your fault. There's no ifs and or buts to be said about it. Unlike other games where a slightly slower reaction time can make the difference or luck comes into play, Go is purely about your inner strength and ability to make the right decision.

I'm writing this post right after a game that I knew I could definitely win, but my overconfidence allowed my opponent to advantage of my weaknesses and turn the game around in his favor [Move 250]. As you might guess, I am feeling pretty crappy at the moment.

Here's the thing though. When the game is over and you're staring into the abyss thinking of the move you should have made, do not despair and fall into a spiraling pit of regret.

So I messed up this endgame pretty awfully this time around. Guess what. There will be numerous games after this where I will try my utmost to prevent from happening again. And when solid endgame play becomes second nature to me, guess who'll be getting stronger once more?

I will not dwell on this any longer, as discovering a weakness is simply another opportunity for gaining strength. So onward I'll go, towards the pursuit of the player I know that I am capable of becoming.
