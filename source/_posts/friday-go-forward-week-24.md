## Friday Go Forward: Week 24

## Overview

While it's been fun reading so many books at once, I am starting to feel the weight of my training bear down on me. My usual nightly routine now essentially is comprised of me trying to study until I literally pass out. Then I wake up randomly in a couple of hours, and make my way to bed. Needless to say, it's not the most productive route and it definitely starting to take a toll on me. I need a more efficient system then what I've been doing. Haha. So starting next week, I plan on cutting down the number of books and trying to get everything into a better balance.
