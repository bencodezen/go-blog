</span></div><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">**Review:**</span></div><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">
</span></div><div>[<span style="font-family: inherit;">Slate and Shell</span>](http://www.slateandshell.com/)<span style="font-family: inherit;"> is one of the most well known publishers and distributors of Go books in English.  Naturally, it was only a matter of time before I arrived at their home page.  </span></div><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">
</span></div><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Their Go books contain a nice variety that cover most of the major topics you'd hope to see at a site that exclusively sells Go books.  As one of Kiseido's competitors, they pretty much have everything you might expect from Kiseido and probably a little more.  This is not to be much of a surprise since their market is the English literate population.</span></div><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">
</span></div><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">I ordered three books: How Not to Play Go, Understanding How to Play Go, and Understanding Dan Level Play by Zhou Yuan.  The shipping was only $5.00 and they did not disappoint since I received my order within a week (ordered on the 21st of August, and it arrived around the 25th).</span></div><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">
</span></div><span style="font-family: inherit;">In comparison to Kiseido, I'd have to say that their e-mail confirmation was far more professional and comforting.  </span>

</span></div><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Here's a screenshot of Slate and Shell's....</span></div><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">
</span></div><div style="clear: both; text-align: center;">[<span style="font-family: inherit;">![](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_R3zwHD97QhU/TH5PxcPqP0I/AAAAAAAAAFA/pM50daUqqy4/s400/slateandshell+confirmation.jpg)</span>](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_R3zwHD97QhU/TH5PxcPqP0I/AAAAAAAAAFA/pM50daUqqy4/s1600/slateandshell+confirmation.jpg)</div><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">
</span></div><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Here's a screenshot of Kisedo's....</span></div><div><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">
</span></div><div style="clear: both; text-align: center;">[<span style="font-family: inherit;">![](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_R3zwHD97QhU/TH5QrmeU3bI/AAAAAAAAAFI/qa6YmsWdVvc/s320/kiseido+confirmation.png)</span>](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_R3zwHD97QhU/TH5QrmeU3bI/AAAAAAAAAFI/qa6YmsWdVvc/s1600/kiseido+confirmation.png)</div><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">
</span></div><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">As you can see, DRASTIC difference.  (Don't get me wrong, I still enjoy Kiseido's books.  It's just they could do a better job on not making me worry that I've just handed my information over to a Grade C hacker.)</span></div><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">
</span></div><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">**Conclusion:**</span></div><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">
</span></div><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Slate and Shell has a great selection of books at great prices.  In addition to the typical Go books that you will expect to pay around $25.00 for (e.g. dictionaries of tesuji), Slate and Shell offers a nice selection of books in the lower price range (e.g. How Not to Play Go by Yuan Zhou $10.00) that still contain quality information.  </span></div></div>
