## Review:

[Slate and Shell](http://www.slateandshell.com/) is one of the most well known publishers and distributors of Go books in English.  Naturally, it was only a matter of time before I arrived at their home page.

Their Go books contain a nice variety that cover most of the major topics you'd hope to see at a site that exclusively sells Go books.  As one of Kiseido's competitors, they pretty much have everything you might expect from Kiseido and probably a little more.  This is not to be much of a surprise since their market is the English literate population.

I ordered three books: How Not to Play Go, Understanding How to Play Go, and Understanding Dan Level Play by Zhou Yuan.  The shipping was only $5.00 and they did not disappoint since I received my order within a week (ordered on the 21st of August, and it arrived around the 25th).

In comparison to Kiseido, I'd have to say that their e-mail confirmation was far more professional and comforting.  </span>

As you can see, DRASTIC difference.  (Don't get me wrong, I still enjoy Kiseido's books.  It's just they could do a better job on not making me worry that I've just handed my information over to a Grade C hacker.)

## Conclusion:

Slate and Shell has a great selection of books at great prices.  In addition to the typical Go books that you will expect to pay around $25.00 for (e.g. dictionaries of tesuji), Slate and Shell offers a nice selection of books in the lower price range (e.g. How Not to Play Go by Yuan Zhou $10.00) that still contain quality information.  </div>
