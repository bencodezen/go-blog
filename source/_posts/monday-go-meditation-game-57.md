	<p>Though I would have ideally preferred these games to have come out during the month of April, I'm happy to finally feature my games from <a href="http://www.thegochallenge.blogspot.com.au/2014/04/april-challenge.html">Maaike's April's Challenge</a>.* This game was Game #1 for Maaike's April's Challenge. Though this might seem like an aggressive game, I think that I was successful in learning to curb my bloodlust and let White live instead of killing and instead taking large profit in the center. Hopefully you'll agree. Enjoy!</p>

## One Point Lesson

More often than not, letting a group live in gote will yield profits.

*_For those who haven't read it, the basic challenge was to "get out of your comfort zone." So for myself, I chose to try and play more calmly and territorially (however I had not yet studied [Master Play: The Territorial Style of Kitani Minoru and Cho Chikun](http://www.slateandshell.com/SSYZ009.html) yet, so I tried to achieve it based on what I knew at the time)._
