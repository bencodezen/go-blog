Normally I try not to post twice in a day, but being as it is the first of July, I didn't want to miss the opportunity to go ahead and post about my new training program: Korean Style Reboot!

Starting today, I will be faithfully following the Korean texts you see above everyday until I finish them all. (I'm still missing the answer book from the Jump Level Up series and the Train Like a Pro series, but I I have more than enough to start with. =D) In the meantime, I have also created a new account on Tygem (zenlotus) that will start from 18k and go as far as I can take it. I'll still be on the other servers, but my primary focus will be on Tygem when I have the time.

And to clarify, it's not that I won't study any of the other books I have, it's just that I will be making sure to spend a dedicated amount of time each day to the Korean baduk books.

Korean training reboot initiate!
