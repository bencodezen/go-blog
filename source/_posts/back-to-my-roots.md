As some of you may have heard, [GoGameGuru published a post today](https://gogameguru.com/roots/) that talks about going back to its roots. And while I'd never compare my work to the accomplishments of David and his team, the post resonated with me.

When I first started this blog, I saw it as a way to track my progress and as a journal for people to read. Over time, I tested out different ideas: Monday Go Meditation, Thursday Go Tygem, Friday Go Forward, etc.  And not to mention, I was in graduate school and had way more free time on my hands than I do now.

There is and always will be a part of me that wishes I could devote all  my time and energy to go. Upon reflection, that idealistic desire of being all or nothing has been my problem all along. And this not only applies to go, but other things in my life as well.

If life is the 19x19 board we are all so familiar with, I realized that the boundaries are not static nor permanent. It would be much simpler if things would stay the same, but that's not how my life is. As someone who always seeks new experiences, it's only natural that my interests are diverse. What was once a corner I thought I had complete control over can become center territory with an exposed side ready to come under attack at any point.

To clarify though, I'm not saying that my weekly posts will never return; but they'll be on hiatus for a while. Or well, at least while I'm putting back the foundation of this blog together.

So until then, look forward to a return of organic posts that sprout from random thoughts and encounters in go!
