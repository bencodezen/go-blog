summary:
	<p>Today's game comes from the last ranked game that I played on KGS. There are parts of the game that I'm proud of, but overall I felt it was a bit reckless of me for the most part. Perhaps it was due to the fact that my attention was split, but it is a game that I should have convincingly lost and somehow make a rather exciting comeback.</p>
