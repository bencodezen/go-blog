## Overview

Happy Chinese New Year everyone! It's the Year of the Horse and with that I think the theme for this new (lunar) year will be charging forward full speed!

I've been a little quieter this week than I would have liked, but I've started on some new ventures that I think will greatly enhance my life and I'll be sure to report on them once I feel I've settled down and gotten in a good rhythm with it. But meanwhile, I've been working hard on figuring out how to do game reviews effectively without consuming a lot of time. It seems as if I'm constantly trying to catch up on creating game reviews no matter how hard I try. I think the plan is to try and review the games immediately after in order to speed up the process.

Second, I have been much more active on KGS that I have been in the past. In particular, I have actually started playing longer games again (i.e., 30 minutes main time each person). Many thanks goes out to my friend [Nate](http://www.nateeagle.com) for helping me get back on track. I will write a post on his advice to me later, so be looking out for that later.

The other focus of mine has been to get the rest of my reviews finished within the next week or so. I still have a couple of product and book reviews to finish and they've been hanging over my head. So hopefully I'll be able to get those done ASAP so I can alleviate that weight off my back.

Finally, you'll probably notice that I but the training regimen in half. This is due to the fact that I was actually having a hard time simply doing 10 a day. It's not so much that I "couldn't," but more along the lines of I was unable to be consistent since the 10 problems felt like a lot more when you also have like 30 other things that need your attention that day. So I'm dropping it down to 5 to see if that can get me to a perfectly consistent level.
