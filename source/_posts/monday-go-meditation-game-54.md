	<p>For this week’s meditation, I’m happy to feature Tilwen back on the blog. Overall, I have to say that I felt I played well; but I completely mishandled the invasion on the top and ended up losing after making mistake after mistake. This is definitely a great example of how to lose a won game. Hope you enjoy!</p>
