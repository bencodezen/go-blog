So I just read an interesting article from the AGA concerning how "serious studies of go causes actual physical changes in the brain." Although this doesn't come as much of a surprise for most serious go players, I think it's great that we now have more significant data that will be useful in our proponent of the game.

As any relatively serious go player might expect, they found that "larger regions of white matter... that are related to attentional control, working memory, executive regulation, and problem solving" were found in what they termed as "long-termed trained players."

This will be interesting to see more research studies done on what go can do for us mentally.
