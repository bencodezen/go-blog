So ironically my friend Todd happens to have been using the screenname "zenix" for like all his life.  Now mind you... I pronounce mine "zeh-nix" while he pronounces his "zee-nix."  Anyhow, although the odds are like a bajillion to one (and those who know the statistics feel free to correct me) that we made the same screenname, I just thought it'd be better if I took the highroad and made a bengozen account anyhow since this is the brand I'm trying to blog with.  With that in mind, I'll probably be getting the KGS Plus soon, and will be reviewing that as soon as I make some use of it.
