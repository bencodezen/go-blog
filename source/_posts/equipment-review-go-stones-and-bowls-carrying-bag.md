## Go Bowls and Stones Carrying Bag

## Overall Rating: 8 / 10 Ponnuki

### Important Notice

This review is based on the bag that I received two years ago. Since then, [YMImports](http://www.ymimports.com) has upgraded the carrying bag to also include bowl straps as well. With that new feature, the bag's review would escalate to a 9 or 10 Ponnuki status.

### Highlights

*   Best carrying bag for go stones and bowls that I've seen on the market.
*   The bag is made of durable material that hasn't shown signs of ripping.
*   The handles are a little more fragile, so be a little more careful relying on those.

### Product Details

*   Travel vinyl bag with two handles and a single zipper for the top.
*   Fits standard Go bowls up to 5'' wide and 4'' high

### Detailed Review

In my constant search for better go equipment, this bag is one of the few that I've seen that combines the desired functionality of providing a travel case for your stones and bowls while looking great and at a fantastic price.

**Size &amp; Weight:** The stones have a solid weight to them that gives a great feeling when picking each one up and placing it on the board. They fit very well on the Shin-Kaya Board that I purchased, but keep in mind that each  board is unique in what their max stone size is.

**Durability:** I am not transporting my stones every day, but in the last two years I've used them, I have seen very little wear and tear. My only real critique is that the handles seem a little bit more flimsy that I would like. However, I really can't speak for the handles since I rarely use them due to being paranoid for the safety of my bowls and stones; but on the few times that I've used them, they hold up quite well.

**Usability:** In addition to its expected use as a carrying bag, it also functions really well as a protective case for your bowls and stones in the event you need to store them away for whatever reason.

In all honesty, this is a purchase I consider mandatory for anyone looking to purchase go stones and bowls. You will not regret making this purchase (especially with the new updated bowl straps).
