So yesterday wasn't as eventful as I'd like, I got to play Keith in a full on handicap game and that was fun.... but then I had to leave early so no more Go that night... I also forgot to bring my Kifu book from YMImports so bummer that.

Today was interesting though.  I got to play one timed game (regular and speed) with Todd.  Definitely have a long way to go... And then I got to play two more games that were quite challenging.  I made some careless errors and reads that cost me the game, but I think I've learned a lot from it.  I'm still too unfamiliar with what to do and how to read things... so more studying to do.
