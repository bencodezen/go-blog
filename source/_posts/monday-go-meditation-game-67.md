	<p>For this week’s meditation, we are turning back the clock to my first game at the <a href="/2014/09/24/go-congress-2014-prelude/">Go Congress 2014 — Prelude</a>! For those who need a refresher, this game was from the day I arrived in New York and was asked to play a match while we were waiting for people to arrive. It’s a fun game that shows just how you can find the opportunity to reverse a game if you’re willing to roll up your sleeves and complicate things. Hope you enjoy this game!</p>

## One Point Lesson

When you’re behind, making the game complicated is your best chance at reversing the game back in your favor.
