## Introduction

And we're back to handicap games! In my kadoban with my friend Paul, it seems we are at a stalemate with 3 stones. Today's game is one where you will see how difficult it is to truly silence an opponent's stones in addition to how speed of development at the opening can poise White to even out the battlefield.

## **One Point Lesson**

**Unless the stones are removed from the board, it is very difficult to truly silence your opponent's stones.**
