### What I Expected

*   <span style="line-height: 13px;">A thorough explanation of the purpose and goal behind the Chinese opening.</span>
*   Explanation of what happens when someone tries to interrupt the Chinese opening.
*   Examples of how the Chinese fuseki is used in different situations.

### What You Can Expect

*   <span style="line-height: 13px;">Everything I mentioned above plus...</span>
*   Much more detailed explanation behind the purpose of individual aspects of the Chinese opening (e.g., How to respond when your opponent approaches the star point stone as opposed to the 3-4 stone of the Chinese opening).
*   How to handle building and destroying the large frameworks that can often result from peaceful games with the Chinese opening.

### My Thoughts as a 5 Kyu

As the first book I read on the Chinese opening, I was very pleased with the scope and breadth that Kato covers with this book. Although it seems rather short, Kato does a fantastic job starting from the very basics of the Chinese opening to small details that are very case specific. In addition, Kato covers a number of variations for each scenarios that helps to answer a lot of questions people might have as to why one result is better than another.

While this book can read like a textbook and is difficult to fully absorb after only a single reading, I think it is a fantastic reference and would recommend it to any players who are serious about _studying_ the Chinese fuseki.
