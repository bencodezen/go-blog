[expand title="Before I Read This Book..." trigclass="expandTitle"]

As a mid to high SDK (i.e., single digit kyu) player, I was expecting to see the same quality of content from previous volumes. In addition, I was hoping that I would be able to solve most problems with relative ease while finding some problems challenging.

[/expand]

[expand title="My Review" trigclass="expandTitle" expanded="true"]

Once again, Lee Jae-Hwan has managed to sweep me off my feet when it comes to providing incredible content that really got my brain working. There were countless sections in here that I always knew about but really appreciated getting a chance to truly practice. Examples include: Identifying Seki, The Loose Connection, The Stone Pagoda, Hane Twice to Gain a Liberty, etc.

Overall, I felt that the problems definitely started to increase in difficulty. While some problems are still very easy to solve and have very obvious solutions, there were numerous times where I had to really start looking at variations before concluding what my answer was going to be. I really appreciated this gradual increase in difficulty.

Finally, some of you will notice that my "Things to Improve" section has become more of an Errata section (i.e., errors that I found). Although I still love the book and the series as a whole, there were a few more errors than I would have liked to have seen and some sections that weren't as clear as they could have been (i.e., Cut On the Opposite Side).

Nonetheless, this is still a wonderful addition to the series, and I'm looking forward to the next one!

[expand title="Synopsis" trigclass="expandTitle"]

**What did I enjoy about the book?**

*   A very nice emphasis on evaluating seki positions.
*   Has the reader practice "fake nets."
*   Does not hesitate to bring back basics like reading the ladder.
*   Really trains a lot of skills players often overlook like identifying vital points, hane twice to gain a liberty, and loose ladders.
**What did I gain from reading this book?**

*   More comfortable with my ability to recognize seki positions.
*   Increased familiarity with various nets and reading out whether they work or not.
*   Increased confidence in reading out variations of basic life and death sequences.
**What is the format of the book?**

*   The book is primarily structured as follows:

    *   (1) A one page explanation of the topic that you are about to practice. Example: When behind in liberties. They not only show the sequence for the proper technique, but also include common mistakes and brief explanations as to why they are mistakes.
    *   (2) A set of very easy to understand and follow practice problems to ensure you understand what you are learning.
**What aspect can be improved on?**

*   Page 65 (#11) - Not a great example of bamboo vital point.
*   Page 66 (#5) - Answer is not the actual weakpoint. The 4-1 point is the weak point.
*   Page 69 (#4) - No solution available. Answer is the 4-1 point.
*   Page 94 Solutions - Label misprint. Skipped #10.
*   Page 122 (#12), Page 123 (#18), and Page 128 (#18) are identical problems.
*   Page 127 (#12) - In the wrong section. Different problem than expected. A save black problem in a kill white section.
*   Page 128 (#18) - In the wrong section. A kill white problem in a Save black section.
*   Page 143 (#22) - Again. Seems out of place. Problem's solution is to maximize Black's profit and not reduce White's.
*   Page 148 (#3 Solution) - Wrong diagram. The answer should be the solid connection at 4-2 point. The tiger's mouth at 4-1 works as well but leaves a ko threat of an atari at 3-2 and is therefore inferior to the solid connection.
**Is this book easy to read?**

*   Yes. Other than a few odd grammatical structures, it doesn't get much more simple or straightforward than this.
**Bottom Line**

1.  Continues to live up to the quality of content you come to expect from this series.
2.  Completely worth your time and money!
