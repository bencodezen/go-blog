Hey everyone. I just got back from Hong Kong yesterday. So while I'd love to write all about my Hong Kong trip, I'll need to finish catching up before doing so. But overall, the trip went well and I got to spend a bit of time really fine tuning my approach to go along with having the pleasure of visiting the Hong Kong Go Association. More on that later though. Hope you all are doing well!
