For those who haven't heard the news, I am super excited to inform you aboutÂ [GoGameGuru's announcement on introducing new and affordable go equipment](http://gogameguru.com/new-affordable-go-equipment/)!! As an avid go enthusiast who is constantly checking local stores and online retailers for go equipment, it is really exciting to see GoGameGuru fill a niche of go equipment that I think is desperately lacking right now. Here are the featured products that are coming to GoGameGuru:

1.  [Foldable Go Board](http://shop.gogameguru.com/folding-go-board/) - At $25 for a very beautiful looking foldable go board, this is probably the product I'm most excited about since I have been unsuccessful in locating a nice quality foldable go board for me to bring with me wherever I go.
2.  [Dirt Cheap Go Set](http://shop.gogameguru.com/dirt-cheap-go-set/) - It's currently on sale for $9.99, but even it's regular price of $14.99 is an ABSOLUTE STEAL when it comes to the fact you are getting a full size plastic go board along with stones and bowls! It doesn't get much better than this if you are looking to start your own go club and want to have enough equipment without breaking the bank.
3.  [Featherweight Go Set](http://shop.gogameguru.com/plastic-biconvex-stones-go-set/) - This is on sale for $19.99 (regular price $25.00) and seems to be an upgraded version of the [Dirt Cheap Go Set](http://shop.gogameguru.com/dirt-cheap-go-set/). Looks pretty sweet based on the pictures!
4.  [Go Stone Sample Packs](http://shop.gogameguru.com/go-stones/) - Priced around $10 each, they also offer you a chance to purchase a sample pack of stones for you to check out before choosing to finally invest in the full set! And if you're wondering why this is so cool, the sample packs are primarily slate and shell stones. xD
With that said and done, I want to inform all of you that I will be purchasing all of these products and will be reviewing them as soon as I get them. So you can expect to see some changes coming to the Equipment Review section in preparation for these awesome products.
