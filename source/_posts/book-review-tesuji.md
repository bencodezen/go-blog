[expand title="Synopsis" trigclass="expandTitle" expanded="true"]

1.  Great introduction to tesujis since the chapters are short and the explanations are concise.
2.  Problems are a bit advanced for players learning tesuji, but should be viewed as exposure material instead of a test of knowledge.
3.  Reminds me of an abridged textbook where it covers a lot of material and organized in an intuitive format that helps to give context to the tesujis being presented.

**My Abilities**

*   This is my second time reading the book; but besides having a decent grasp of the three most basic tesujis: snapbacks, ladders, and nets, I would have to say that my ability to find tesuji is rather weak.
**My Perspective**

*   When I first got this book, I was really hoping to get exposed to a lot of different tesujis along with some context as to how they were being used. For example, this tesuji is good for connecting stones.

[expand title="My Review" trigclass="expandTitle" expanded="true"]
**What did I enjoy about the book?**

*   Tesujis are presented in contexts such as "amputate the cutting stone" that help to show how tesujis can be utilized for multiple purposes. For example, the squeeze tesuji is presented in both "amputate the cutting stone" and "making shape."
*   The chapters are written in a concise manner with just enough diagrams to make it a short read while illustrating everything very clearly.
*   There are always practice problems after every tesuji they introduce.
**What did I gain from reading this book?**

*   A better grasp on tesujis as a whole.
*   New ideas regarding how tesujis can be utilized for multiple purposes.
*   Slightly improved reading ability.
**What style of teaching does the book use?**

*   Textbook Approach

    *   Organized in a curriculum format that reflects the learning style one might normally find in school.

*   Primary Learning Mechanism:

    *   Explanations with example diagrams

*   Other Learning Mechanisms:

    *   Practice problems
**What aspect can be improved on?**

*   I would have liked to see more introductory problems for each tesuji since there was no predicting how complicated the problems would be at the end of each chapter.
**Is this book easy to read?**

*   Yes. With its short and concise chapters and explanations, it is usually pretty easy to finish a section within a chapter in 5-10 minutes.
