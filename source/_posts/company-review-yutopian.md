**Review:**

So for those who are looking at Yutopian too... yeah I detest the layout too.  It's just I know that there have got to be an amateur web designer who could easily redesign this.  (Just another thing on my list if I ever get to be a prominent figure in Go)  And not to mention the ordering method is almost just as sketchy as Kiseido.  Fortunately for all of us though, it's just as safe!

I ordered the Go Proverbs book by Nihon Ki-in, and it came within the 8 business days that was promised.  The condition and packaging was nothing to complain about.

Keeping with tradition of my previous reviews, here's my e-mail confirmation:

</div>**Conclusion:**

Nothing to worry about if you plan on purchasing books.  I haven't purchased any equipment from them yet, but I'd say if you really want something specifically from that site... you'll probably be alright.  (I still am personally biased towards YMImports if you compare the same products side by side).
