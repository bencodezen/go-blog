Over the last few days or so, I have to admit that I have started to feel more and more burnt out when it comes to go. For a while, I couldn't quite grasp why I was feeling this way. After all, I haven't been studying a lot nor playing a lot, so what was the cause?

Well, after a lot of introspection, I came to the conclusion that I have hit rock bottom when it comes to failing to judge the board as a whole. Years of not counting and avoiding making positional judgments have finally caught up to me. However, I know that if I continue down this path, I'll probably actually burnout and could lose the immense enjoyment I get from this game.

Ever since my blog started back up last year, I've been trying to tear through book after book in hopes of compiling a really comprehensive book review library. So naturally (with the exception of [<span style="text-decoration: underline;">First Kyu</span>](http://www.bengozen.com/book-review-first-kyu/ "Book Review: First Kyu") and <span style="text-decoration: underline;">[Lessons in the Fundamentals of Go](http://www.bengozen.com/book-review-lessons-in-the-fundamentals-of-go/ "Book Review: Lessons in the Fundamentals of Go"))</span>, I have only read each book once and no more. However, I think it's time that I slowed down and revisited [Positional Judgment](http://www.bengozen.com/book-review-positional-judgment/ "Book Review: Positional Judgment") and [The Direction of Play](http://www.bengozen.com/book-review-the-direction-of-play/ "Book Review: The Direction of Play") again. It might slow down my reviews a bit, but it's probably imperative that I do so. Here's to hoping this works._
