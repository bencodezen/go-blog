[expand title="Before I Read This Book..." trigclass="expandTitle"]

**My Abilities**

*   A mid to high SDK (single digit kyu) kyu who has read his fair share of go books and has a pretty strong foundation in the basics and teaching go.
**My Perspective**

*   I was able to progress through Level Up 4 pretty easily, so I was hoping that this would be pretty straightforward as well.
[/expand]

[expand title="My Review" trigclass="expandTitle" expanded="true"]

**What did I enjoy about the book?**

*   It introduces the reader to the concept of good and bad shapes.
*   Starts training the reader to practice looking for important stones.
*   They do a great job introducing seki and offer lots of really simple but effective practice problems for it.
**What did I gain from reading this book?**

*   Polished my ability to distinguish between key stones in capturing races.
*   Started rebuilding my ability to see seki positions from the ground up.
*   Polished my abilities to use nets, shortage of liberties, ladders, and snapback.
**What style of teaching does the book use?**

*   Curriculum Style

		*   Content is organized into lessons, topics, or themes in order to facilitate learning.

*   Primary Learning Mechanism:

		*   Practice problems

*   Other Learning Mechanisms:

		*   Cute and entertaining comics to teach and/or reinforce lessons.
		*   Simple explantations that are accompanied by equally simple diagrams.
**What aspect(s) can be improved on?**

*   No complaints here. I was really happy with the progression of problems in this book.
*   Errata - Question #3 on page 51 - Black's shape seems incorrect. The stones should form a solid triangle instead of the hanging connection.
**Is this book easy to read?**

*   Yes. It was very easy to understand all the explanations and progress through the book.
