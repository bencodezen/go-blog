Man.... it's only day four of February's training regimen and I can already feel the weight of it bearing down on me. On top of that, I'm playing even more even games with players 5+ stones stronger than me and getting crushed left and right. Not feeling bad about myself or anything, but definitely slightly winded. The good thing is that I think I'm starting to become more immune to losing, but we'll have to wait and see if that's true. =D

As I continue to try and analyze the gaps in my ability, I've found that watching other people's games has been helpful in reinforcing my understanding of the game. While I find myself wanting to yell at the screen when people choose a variation that is in favor of their opponent, the experience is quite humorous as a whole and helps me to see the gaps in other players' knowledge; which in turn helps to fill mine.

Nonetheless, it seems I'm a track to straight losses in ASR; but hopefully I can rack up enough points to stay in the class. Here's to hoping!
