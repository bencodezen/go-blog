## Friday Go Forward: Week 31

## Overview

It's been another crazy week, but I think I've managed to post a bit more than last week. So let's call that a win shall we? Haha. Otherwise though, it's been a more studious week that has been focused on trying to gain a better foothold on how I plan on continuing my work on the blog. Though it has come a long way since its beginnings at Blogger, it is still falling short of my expectations and visions as a designer. Although before I get too ahead of myself, I still need to focus on making sure that new content is being pushed out so that there will be something to fill my designs when the time comes. =) Meanwhile, I will bide my time and jot down all of my ideas. Hopefully the day it all comes together will not be too far in the future. One can hope right? xD
