Up till now, my go studies have been pretty sporadic. I may have read my fair share of books and watched my fair share of videos, but I would have to say that I really never spent the time and energy really absorbing them. Sure, I was exposed to lots of new concepts and ideas; but implementing them in my games was a whole different animal.

After reading a [post](http://noseki.com/2014/05/08/what-was-nonsense-becomes-possible/ "What Was Nonsense Becomes Possible - Noseki") from fellow go blogger Noseki, I was inspired to take a new approach with my go studies by fully immersing myself in it. For example, in my game for [Yunguseng Dojang](http://www.yunguseng.com "Yunguseng Dojang"), I replayed every move on the real board and really took my time to absorb each and every move (which is the reason I ended up losing on time since I completely did not pay attention to my computer which was telling me I was running out of time).

In addition, I've also revamped my primary study materials for books. I'm going back to the Level Up Series (starting with [Level Up! Review 1](http://www.bengozen.com/book-review-level-up-review-1/ "Book Review: Level Up Review 1") since I don't have time to start all the way back at [Level Up 1](http://www.bengozen.com/book-review-level-up-1/ "Book Review: Level UpÂ 1")) and working my way through it with extreme thoroughness. In other words, no solution whatsoever. I will work through every problem and solve it with absolute certainty before moving on.

If I have any hope of becoming any stronger, I think that it's finally time that I stopped cutting corners. The time for me to be knocking at the door of the dans is fast approaching, and I have no intention of letting myself be caught unawares when that time comes.
