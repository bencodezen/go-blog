Well everyone, looks like this will be my final post for 2012.Â As I look back at 2012 and all the craziness that has come with it, I am definitely glad that go is once again an important part of my life. It's been a fun year with me getting back into go and then bringing the go blog back full force.

In terms of how my progress, here's my rank graph for 2012.

[![2012 rank](http://www.bengozen.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/2012-rank.png)](http://www.bengozen.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/2012-rank.png)

_Note: I did not play a single ranked game in December though. So the graph seems a little weird... haha._

In terms of my big accomplishment, it would have to be that I made it into mid-SDK range. I must admit though, it seems like just yesterday when I was playing as a 10k. Not sure I feel much stronger though. =D

For next year, my goal is to reach a solid dan status on KGS. Ambitious? Yes. Impossible? Don't know till I try. =D

In regards to the blog, here are some things that that you can look forward to:

1.  Weekly Go Wednesdays will be back starting this very week, so please submit any topics or ideas that you might have!
2.  More book reviews!
3.  Go equipment review updates and new additions!
4.  Guides for all players of all different budget sizes!
Finally, I think it is only appropriate that I end the year with a game that I had the pleasure of playing over the weekend. It was a hard fought game where I experimented with a number of ideas. It's a game that I am proud to include in my final kifu for 2012\. As the title of this post suggest, this is a game where we both fought it out till the very last point.
