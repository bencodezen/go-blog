Yesterday, I had the pleasure of attending another one of [Yuan Zhou](http://www.zhouyuan.com/ "Yuan Zhou")'s Monthly Workshops!

We started off with a life and death problem that is called "hunting the 6 stone bird." Apparently it's a very old problem that has been around for a long time, for those wondering what the shape looks like. For those who would like to try it out for themselves, here it is below:

Afterwards, I got to hear a very captivating  review for one of [Lee Changho](http://senseis.xmp.net/?YiChangHo "Lee Chang Ho") 9p Vs. [Park Junghwan](http://senseis.xmp.net/?ParkJungHwan "Park Jung Hwan") 9p games in the most recent Ing Cup World Go Championship. It was one that was full of full of suspense, excitement, and a capturing battle on epic proportions that made Park Junghwan the decisive victor.

As I listened to Yuan Zhou review the game, there were a few things that really struck me:

<!-- more -->

1.  **Professionals pay particular attention to their weak groups**. They almost never let a weak group go unattended for more than a move or two.

2.  **Professionals never play follow the leader.** They try to figure out what their opponent is trying to do, and then usually come up with a move to interrupt the flow of their opponent's game.

3.  **Professional games tend to steer away from killing groups.** The reasons lies in the fact that it is very difficult to kill a group and you usually end up sacrificing a lot of points in the process of attempting to do so.

In addition, one of the biggest takeaways I had from the entire workshop is **how incredibly important life and death is**. I mean, sure, we all know that life and death is "important," but I think that most players brush it off as a tedious chore that gets in the way of their game. And while I will be sure to write an article further detailing my new found appreciation for life and death, I leave you with this thought: Imagine the possibilities if you could live wherever you invaded/reduced. Wouldn't every game become far more simpler?

After the review, we had lunch and played a game with one another. As I looked back on my game, I believe that the reverse komi (-7.5 points) caused my opponent to take more risks than he needed to. In addition, our ranks are most likely about equal, so I believe that the game was rather lopsided to begin with. With that in mind, I do think that my play overall was rather poor and still shows a lack of my attention to the fundamentals of strong players.
