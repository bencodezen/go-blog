Both players: 3-0, and I was facing my worst nightmare: **another** 4 stone handicap game.

In terms of competitive play, this is probably the most intense of all scenarios. Both you and your opponent are aware that only one will emerge victorious, so there is a huge pressure to fight with everything you have till the very end because neither will yield in this kind of game. And as someone who has never been in this situation before, it was an overwhelming feeling that made me shake with anticipation.

As the game was coming to a close, we had a pretty big crowd watching the game. And let me tell you, the only thing that could make losing a crucial game like this even worse would be to do so in front of a crowd of people.

When we finished counting the score, I couldn't believe my ears when I heard: "Black has 59 points. White has 88.5 points."
