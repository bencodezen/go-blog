## Friday Go Forward: Week 47

## Overview

This week is all about playing catchup and getting back to where I was prior to my trip. While it was fun, I have to say that it threw me more out of sync than I would have liked. No matter. Content is back up and running and I'll do my best to prevent it from stopping again.

In terms of overall, the highlight of the week is definitely finding out about [Kaz's Online Go School](http://www.bengozen.com/kazs-go-school-finally/ "Kaz’s Go School is Finally Here!"). If you haven't heard about it, go check out my post and I definitely recommend that you sign up! Even if you can't make all the classes, Kaz will send you the game record from the lesson and it will include his written comments (since he won't be using a mic). Isn't that great?

Other than that, I've been doing my best to actually start playing again. Trying to not put so much pressure on myself before each game. I still get a bit anxious before playing, but I'm hoping that will get better over time. See you all next week!

## Training Regimen

*   **Step #1:** **Do 10 go problems a day. (Estimated time: 10 minutes) - **My California trip totally threw off my training regimen. So this training has been lacking lately. Trying to get back on track this week. Hopefully it'll be back to normal by next week.
