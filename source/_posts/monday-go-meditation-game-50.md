## Introduction

This week's game definitely goes down as the craziest game that I've ever shown on this series to date. It was one that I got to play with fellow go blogger [Eyecatcher](http://www.truthandgo.com "Eyecatcher"). This game is practically anything but normal. And one of the best things about the resulting game is one that was inspired by [Hikaru No Go](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hikaru_no_Go "Hikaru no Go Wikipedia") (Manga).  For a little fun trivia for all those Hikaru No Go fans who have read the manga, after you've seen the second move, do you know which game I'm referring to? (The answer is in the game record).

## **One Point Lesson**

When playing a crazy game like this, you must constantly analyzing the board for weak groups along with where the points are coming from since they can change at any second.
