## Overview

This has been an interesting week that was fraught with frustration, but paired with deep introspection that yielded something valuable for me as a whole. Although it took me some time to realize, there was a growing tendency for me to rush in both Go and my life in general. So, I am grateful that go has once again provided an avenue for me to improve my life as a whole once again. Beginning the path back to zen will have a number of butterfly effects, but I have a feeling they will be far from regrettable. =)

## Lessons Learned

1.  If I feel like I am strapped for time or rushed before I even start a game, it's probably best to not even bother playing.
2.  To refrain from kyu tunnel vision, I need to look at the board with fresh eyes after every move.
