## Friday Go Forward: Week 22

## Overview

As I'm sure you all are aware, this week marks the start of my [Korean Training Reboot](http://www.bengozen.com/korean-training-reboot/ "Korean Training Reboot!")! I am having the time of life as I'm going over the basics of all basics for the first time ever. Now I know it probably sounds stupid to some of you that I'm spending my time on books intended for 30 kyus, but I feel like I am getting a lot of value just drilling basics such as "can my stone escape from atari." It's not so much that I'm learning something "new," but instead I am really trying to polish the fundamentals of my reading ability. Here's to hoping I know what I'm doing!
