## Shin-Kaya - 1-1/2" (4cm) Go Set

### Overall Rating: 10 /10 Ponnuki

### Highlights

*   This is a fantastic set that is complete with high quality yunzi stones, kitani jujube bowls, shin-kaya board, and a travel case for the bowls and stones.
*   A perfect set for any player interested in playing go and wants a quality set without breaking the bank.
*   The go board doubles as a table and floor board, so the set has even more value than simply having a floor board.

### Detailed Review

This was my first set of real go equipment. When it arrived, I was happier than a child on a shopping spree at a toy store. And so, you can imagine how happy I was to see that my order was packaged very well. Here are some shots of the package:

Everything arrived in great condition. The only issue I had was that some of the black stones were missing from the set. So I contacted [YMImports](http://www.ymimports.com) that very day, and received a response within 12 hours notifying me that they would send replacement stones. Way to live up to your reputation of great customer service [YMImports](https://www.ymimports.com)!

The set as a whole is an incredible value. Unless you are looking to specifically buy a floor board, portable board, or another kind of stone (e.g., slate and shell), this the best deal that you're going to find.
