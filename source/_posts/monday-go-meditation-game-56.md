	<p>For this week's meditation, I am happy to feature fellow go blogger <a href="http://kingdomofbaduk.blogspot.fr">Perciles (Kingdom of Baduk)</a> to this series. The game below is a casual game that we played with one another and can in fact be seen as a teaching game of sorts. As Pericles is a 5-6 dan, you can predict the outcome pretty well; but I'm hoping that you'll find the kifu entertaining as I try to flail around the board against his mighty strength. Enjoy!</p>
