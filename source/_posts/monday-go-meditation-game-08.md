## Introduction

With my own games being rather all over the place lately, I decided to try something new and review a game that I had a chance to see live online. This is between an insei in China (Black) and a Chinese professional (White). Since the Chinese Opening is currently a big part of my go, this game was the best choice since I got to see how stronger players not only utilize the Chinese Opening, but how they dealt with a mirror opening.

## **One Point Lesson**

**Having the ideal opening does not mean you have a won game.**
