So last night I had some unexpected bro-time.  It was great to be able to end class and head over to hangout with Nate and discuss philosophy, theology, and then one of the most intense games I've ever played so far.  Man... here's to you Nate.  That was an awesome game. (Unfortunately, I do not have the game record; so lessons learned for next time!)

Now I've talked to Josh recently, and he suggested that I try to play two games a day and play people who are stronger then me without giving the handicap (in order to raise my rank higher).  So interestingly enough, I decided to give it a shot against a 10 kyu.  I have not had time to comment on my moves yet, but you'll see about two to three areas where I'm literally one step short of winning the capture race.  What does this mean? Clearly I did not read it out far enough.  Enjoy bashing away at my very sad game...
