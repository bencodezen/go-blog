## Friday Go Forward: Week 42

## Overview

Can't seem to make up my mind about how I'm writing this summaries, but perhaps this is due to my own confusion lately. There hasn't been too much going on this week, but I have become aware of a few weaknesses of mine that are definitely holding me back and I'll have to address them over time. Meanwhile, I will try to simply survive the onslaught that is work and the rest of my life. Hope your week went better than mine!
