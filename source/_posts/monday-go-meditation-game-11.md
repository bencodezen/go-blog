summary:
	<p>This is my first proper ranked game in almost two months. Although I'm sad to say that I have not been able to have a decisive win yet, it was a game where I felt I was actually in control and not attempting to be too reckless. Plenty of mistake were made, but I am happy to say that my mistakes were never on epic proportions. =D</p>
