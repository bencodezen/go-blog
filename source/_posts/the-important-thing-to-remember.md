Hey everyone. As I'm sure you've noticed, the weekly posts have not gotten to the point where they are coming out weekly just yet. And to be honest, while I found that initially discouraging, I had to remind myself that the important thing to remember is that go is now a part of my regular life.

What does this mean exactly?

* I'm doing tsumego daily. The amount varies from time to time, but it's usually a small batch of ten to twenty-five at a time
* Much to the chagrin of my good friend Nate, I'm playing correspondence games which allows me to going a long time without playing a game.
* I walk by my go board that I set up by my desk and occasionally play out a professional game when I need to get out of my head a bit.

It's not perfect, but it's a hell a lot better than before when I would get discouraged from starting the blog up again cause I couldn't keep up the pace I used to. After all, as many go players will tell you, this journey is an endless one. So if you remember anything, it's that that the name of the game is progress and nothing else.
