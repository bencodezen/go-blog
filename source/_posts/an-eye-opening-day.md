I just finished the arc in [Hajime no Ippo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hajime_no_Ippo) where Takamura fights for his second world title. In an effort not to spoil it for anyone who plans on reading or watching the show, all I will say is that his faithfulness to his fundamentals was incredibly moving. No matter what the situation, people's faith in the fundamentals is what allow them to pull themselves out of the most difficult situations.

Aside from that though, I've had one of the most eye opening lessons to date. My whole perspective on moyos and just go in general has completely changed. Granted, integrating this new perspective into my play will probably be terribly exhausting for awhile; but ho ho ho.... this could change everything...
