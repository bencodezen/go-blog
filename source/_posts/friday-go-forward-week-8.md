## Thoughts

Although it doesn't feel like it, this week has actually been pretty active in regards to playing. As you can see, I have seven ongoing games on [Dragon Go Server](http://www.dragongoserver.net)! And although this isn't final or solid quite yet, my KGS account did manage to hit 5k this week! So we'll see whether or not it sticks around. Haha.

Meanwhile, I find myself actually taking even more time to play games than I used to. I'm in this weird place where 30 minutes feels a bit too short but anything longer than that takes a long time and can be very tiring. Oh well, looks like I have two more things I need to improve: (1) Stamina &amp; (2) My Brain's Processing Speed. After all, I need to get myself competition ready! [MD Open 2013](http://www.bengozen.com/40th-maryland-open-go-tournament/ "40th Maryland Open — Go Tournament!") is only two months away!

Many thanks to the following people for taking the time to find me and play with me on DGS: Paul, Tilwen, Devin, Tyler, Andrew, Todd, and Gurujeet! I'm looking forward to seeing what you all play next!
