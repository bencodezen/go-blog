## Introduction

For today's go meditation, we return to even games as I show another game from my kadoban with long time friend and rival Nate. As he humorously commented after the game was over, it seems that him and I have a difficult time playing "nice games." It seems that we either have these all or nothing games that almost always end in someone going down in glorious fire. At least from my end, I don't ever intentionally try to force the game into that kind of direction; but perhaps my fighting style is what causes it. With that said, I hope you enjoy this week's game review.[

## **One Point Lesson**

**Resigning because you failed to kill a group is inexcusable. One should have the decency to at least count before resigning.**
