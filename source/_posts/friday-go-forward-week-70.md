## Overview

This week has been very sparse in terms of study and playing, but extremely heavy in regards to writing (if you didn’t notice with the Weekly Go Wednesday article). And though my time has been a bit more biased towards writing, I don’t think any of you are complaining. Haha.

It’s taken some time to break into my productivity system, but the cogs and wheels are starting to mesh together better now. I’m much more aware of where my time is going along with how I’m progressing as a whole in life now. Whole board thinking. See that?

I’m looking forward to when my entire system works effortlessly and I can really amp up my go training. No matter though. Slow and steady wins the race.

## Training Regimen

*   Work on go for at least 10–15 minutes a day.

## Games

*   [KGS](http://www.gokgs.com "KGS Website") -  1 game
*   [DGS](http://www.dragongoserver.net/userinfo.php?uid=60385 "Dragon Go Server - BenGoZen") - 6 ongoing games
*   [OGS](http://online-go.com/user/view/549/BenGoZen "Online Go Server - BenGoZen") -  7 ongoing games

## Books

*   [_Get Strong at Tesuji_](http://www.bengozen.com/book-review-get-strong-tesuji/ "Book Review: Get Strong at Tesuji") by Richard Bozulich

## Lessons Learned

*   It doesn’t matter if you make mistakes during your game because your opponent is just as likely to make mistakes if not bigger ones. So don’t be too hard on yourself during a game because you’ll only be making yourself more vulnerable than necessary.
