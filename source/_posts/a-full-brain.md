I had an interesting conversation with frozensoul today. For all my efforts at figuring out what's wrong with me, something I had not considered is that my head is filled to the brim with go material. I am constantly playing and trying to cram more information, but it may be time for me to just completely stop playing and studying.

Hold your keimas and relax. I'm not going to disappear from the go world.Â It's just that I am coincidentally going on vacation next week.

I originally planned to bring a few go books and then study the hell out of them, but it seems that this may be the prime opportunity for me to completely vacate and recover. No playing. No studying. If anything, I'll be meditating on everything and planning to come back with a fresh mind and a new perspective.

Like an addict, it makes me cringe at the thought of not doing anything go related for a whole week; but I think that frozensoul's prescription may just be the medicine I need to get back in the game.
