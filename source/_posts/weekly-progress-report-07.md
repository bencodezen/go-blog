## Overview

Man. The time sure does fly by doesn’t it? It only felt like just yesterday when I rebooted this series and yet here I am seven weeks in.

To be honest, part of me feels like after almost two months, you would think I would have something significant to report; but even this week, the focus is still on the same goal: consistency. At the end of the day, consistency is not nearly so glamorous as a huge gesture of studying that usually fizzles out with an equally bad burnout. On the upside though, I’m at least working on go on a daily basis without impacting the rest of my life in any significant way. And while it still takes a little bit out of me to keep this discipline, I’m thinking that eventually it will become more automatic and ingrained in my routine.

In other news, I wanted to share two sites with you in case you haven’t heard about them:

[Dwyrin.TV](http://www.dwyrin.tv/ "Dwyrin TV") - For those who don’t know Dwyrin (aka Battousai on KGS), he is a popular teacher who has a series of videos on YouTube that many people have learned a great deal from. This site was created as a response to the issue of trying to find his videos or watch them in any sort of hierarchical order. Be sure to check it out. I’m sure you won’t regret it!

[Goishi](http://www.goishi.nl/ "Goishi") - This is a Dutch site that contains a [collection of high resolution photos](http://www.goishi.nl/410849827 "Goishi Photo Album"). Though the site is in Dutch, you can load it in Chrome and there should be an option for it to at least do a basic translation for you.

With that said, I hope you all had a great Halloween and a great weekend. Till next week!
