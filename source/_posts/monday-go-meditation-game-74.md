summary: >
	<p>For this week's Monday Go Meditation, I decided to include a game I played against the computer during my night of losing. I'm not a huge fan of playing against computers; but just like how not playing at all is worse, I wanted to keep reviewing games even though my opponent isn't an actual human. It's a fun one though, so hope you enjoy!</p>
