[expand title="Synopsis" trigclass="expandTitle" expanded="true"]

1.  The story is told from a third person's perspective on "The Master of Go."
2.  Although the story revolves around go, it is more of a historical retelling and/or biography than an intriguing story about go the way [First Kyu](http://www.bengozen.com/book-review-first-kyu/ "Book Review: FirstÂ Kyu") is.
3.  Recommended for someone looking for a meditative elegy on a famous go player's last game.

[expand title="My Review" trigclass="expandTitle" expanded="true"]

I knew beforehand that this book would be more of a historic (but partially fictional) retelling of Shusai's last game. However, that did not stop me from hoping that it would live up (even if only 10%) to First Kyu. So unfortunately, I am the first to admit that I had a harder time appreciating the book after the gripping and culturally enriching storyline that First Kyu had. Though to be fair, it is important to note that the two books have completely different approaches to telling a story that is themed around go.

For what sliver of objectivity I have left in regards to this book, I will admit that it is a book that commands your attention in a way that a drop of water would captivate you after being submerged in pure silence. It certainly is not a book for those looking for a protagonist to become attached to or some plot with twists and jaw-dropping turns. Instead though, there is an air of tranquility and introspection about the game and the player that even I had to appreciate as I read the book. In other words, if I might paraphrase what my friend Martin said, "There's a reason it has a Nobel prize while First Kyu does not."

Bottom line, although this book doesn't rate too highly for me personally, it is a great book if you're looking for a calming book immersed in go during a turbulent time in Japan.
