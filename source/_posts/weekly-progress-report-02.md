## Overview

I am proud to report that I am starting to hit my stride. Not only have I been keeping up my training regimen with little to no effort, but I even increased the minimum requirement because the prior regimen was getting too easy for me to do. Even now I’m considering upping it again, but I’ll stick with it another week and probably start sprinkling in other books in order to keep my interest perked up.

In addition, as many of you have noticed, I actually started releasing Go Congress posts a lot earlier than what I originally forecasted (i.e., Saturday). And I’ll be continuing to release them one day at a time as the day permits.* And in case anyone is wondering, I do plan on doing commentary on all my games from Congress (including any lessons learned from the pro simuls). So for all those who have been waiting, that means exactly what it sounds like: Monday Go Mediations is back in business.

*I like to restrict my posting to once a day in order to give everyone proper time to read the posts and comment if they wish.
