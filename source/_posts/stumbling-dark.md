Today I added another notch to my losses. It was a 2 stone handicap game against a 1k and I completely goofed at the end. No reason I shouldn't have won, but I just couldn't see it through.

And the funny thing is that this trend seems to be consistent with other things I tried to switch my attention to momentarily (like League of Legends). Part of me wonders whether I've acquired some sort of "losing" mindset; but on second though, it's rather unlikely since I know that starting off any game being like "I'm going to lose anyways" is a recipe for disaster.

As this is the first day in my quest to return back to my origins, I shouldn't be surprised that things are not much different than yesterday. There's a big mix of frustration, loss, and clarity all at the time. And to be honest, it feels as if stumbling through the dark blindly reaching for anything I can hold on to to feel like I'm making progress. I have no idea if it's going to get me where I want to go, but it certainly seems to beat standing still.

On the bright side, I'm glad I'm not gambling any time soon.
