So here's the game that broke my miserable resignation streak from last night. It was a game against a 9k. We played with a proper handicap this time (one guy tried to give me less stones earlier and as the idiot I accepted... let's just say it didn't go so well).

Overall, I definitely have come to see the game in a different light. As someone who was told that life and death is my first priority, it's easy to get caught up in old habits and just simply try to kill the opponent's stones the whole time. This game was a clear illustration of my growth from that mindset. At least I hope it is...
