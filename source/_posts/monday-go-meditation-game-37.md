## Introduction

For this week's go meditation, we take one last stroll down memory lane when I gain one more stone and become a 12k! Unfortunately, my level of play in this game seems to be far weaker than the game I showed last week, but it should still be a great example of DDK level play.

I hope that you've enjoyed this month's theme of Novice November and was able to pick up a few things along the way regarding DDK play and how to try and fix them. If you have any questions at all, please don't hesistate to leave a comment below or contact me! Till next week![

## **One Point Lesson**

Once your group is stable, any further moves in that same area will only help your opponent.
