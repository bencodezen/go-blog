## Introduction

We're taking a break from handicap games this week and revisiting a game that I got to play with my longtime friend and rival Nate! It is a game that is fraught with big swings and a big case of kyu tunnel vision from both players. This is probably one of my last Chinese fuseki games for a while, so I hope that you enjoy it!

## **One Point Lesson**

**Whenever you lose a group, don't let your emotions ovherwelm you and resign. Calm down. More often than not, there will be a chance for you to turn the tides.**
