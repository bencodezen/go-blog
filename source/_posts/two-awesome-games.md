So sorry for the failure to post Friday or Saturday. Lots going on, but the following kifu is of my game against an 8k. I think it was pretty exciting and an excellent game for my persistence and some of my more clever moves that I've played in my games so far. Unfortunately, I ended up losing by 1.5 points. I'm pretty sure I messed up some yose maneuvers which may have actually cost me the game. I also managed to make it to GWGC after running some errands and had part of my game reviewed and learned some really interesting things. I'll put the comments in on the parts that were reviewed.

To top everything off however, I also got to play my FIRST game of.... wait for it.... ONE COLOR GO. And actually, it was also my first game against Mr. Justin Teng. Now mind you, I wasn't trying to win... I was just trying to make it as far as I could into the game. Here's a picture of the game.

Not shabby for my first game. Now I'm almost certainly being decimated, but I was happy with being able to get this far.
