## Introduction

With this week, we continue on with Game #4 of Maaike's [April Challenge](http://www.thegochallenge.blogspot.com.au/2014/04/april-challenge.html "Maaike"), which also happens to be the first round of the [1st Washington Open Baduk Championship](http://www.bengozen.com/1st-washington-open-baduk-championship-part/ "1st Washington Open Baduk Championship — Part I") that I participated in a month or so ago. Though it ended up being a completely crazy roller coaster of a match, it is an excellent example of how volatile games can be in tournaments. Because of the pressure of competition, players will look for any slack move or advantage they can to reverse the game. With that said, hang on to your seats cause this is going to be a bumpy one!

## **One Point Lesson**

In a tournament game, you almost always want to play till the end. You never know if your opponent might crack under the pressure.
