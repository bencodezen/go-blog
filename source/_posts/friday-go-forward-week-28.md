## Friday Go Forward: Week 28

## Overview

Over this past week, I've been rather introspective about where I am in life and where I want to be over the next few years. While go has been an incredible addition to my life and has enriched in a more ways than I can count, I am working on figuring out how to utilize other aspects of growth to not only improve my overall self-achievement; but to also as transfer that knowledge back to go as well. A simple of example of this was my [post on boxing earlier this week](http://www.bengozen.com/boxing-and-go/ "Boxing and Go"). So while my studying and playing has been rather laid back, I'm optimistic of the changes I'm making and the impact it'll have on my go abilities. =)
