<span style="font-family: inherit;">_So as I've been working on the guides for purchasing Go equipment, I realized that one of the killer aspects of buying online is the shipping cost.  It makes it near impossible for me to write the guides since some of the products which deliver some of the best quality are within the (let's say) $50 range but shipping makes it like $60-$70\.  So one of the things I thought of was to see how available Go equipment might be in the area. _</span>
<div><span style="font-family: inherit;">
</span></div><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Since I live in the Montgomery County area, there is a decent amount of Asian stores around here.  I happened to be in the area of an old time favorite ([W.J. Bookstore](http://maps.google.com/maps/place?cid=9141942096569500490&q=wj+bookstore&gl=us&cd=1&cad=src:pplink&ei=GPiYTJifNp-KygSVmuXjBg)) and decided to check it out.  They did have a small section for Go stuff, and they sold some of the same products my brother first bought when he started a few years back.</span></div><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">

</span></div><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">The original board </span>**<span style="font-family: inherit;">(review coming soon)</span>**<span style="font-family: inherit;"> that we bought wasn't there anymore, but they have a new product </span>**<span style="font-family: inherit;">(review coming soon)</span>**<span style="font-family: inherit;"> that I think is far better (and only costs $15 with tax!!!).</span></div><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">
</span></div><div style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div><div style="clear: both; text-align: center;">[<span style="font-family: inherit;">![](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_R3zwHD97QhU/TJjvPm3gccI/AAAAAAAAAN8/Ad7qkElDTrI/s320/IMG_1907.JPG)</span>](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_R3zwHD97QhU/TJjvPm3gccI/AAAAAAAAAN8/Ad7qkElDTrI/s1600/IMG_1907.JPG)</div><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">
</span><span style="font-family: inherit;">In other words, they have a nice amount of Go books (all in Chinese of course) and lower end Go equipment that would be great for any beginning players who aren't looking to invest a lot of money.  I also tried going down Rockville Pike to see if another Asian bookstore still existed, but unfortunately it's gone so no luck there.  </span>

<span style="font-family: inherit;"></span>In the event any of you live in the area, this is the address (it's on the second floor of the Wintergreen Plaza):
