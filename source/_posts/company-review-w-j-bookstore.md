_So as I've been working on the guides for purchasing Go equipment, I realized that one of the killer aspects of buying online is the shipping cost.  It makes it near impossible for me to write the guides since some of the products which deliver some of the best quality are within the (let's say) $50 range but shipping makes it like $60-$70.  So one of the things I thought of was to see how available Go equipment might be in the area. _

Since I live in the Montgomery County area, there is a decent amount of Asian stores around here.  I happened to be in the area of an old time favorite ([W.J. Bookstore](http://maps.google.com/maps/place?cid=9141942096569500490&q=wj+bookstore&gl=us&cd=1&cad=src:pplink&ei=GPiYTJifNp-KygSVmuXjBg)) and decided to check it out.  They did have a small section for Go stuff, and they sold some of the same products my brother first bought when he started a few years back.

Here's a picture of the stones that we bought years ago.  If you want the review, click here (coming soon).

The original board that we bought wasn't there anymore, but they have a new product (review coming soon) that I think is far better (and only costs $15 with tax!!!).

In other words, they have a nice amount of Go books (all in Chinese of course) and lower end Go equipment that would be great for any beginning players who aren't looking to invest a lot of money.  I also tried going down Rockville Pike to see if another Asian bookstore still existed, but unfortunately it's gone so no luck there.  </span>

In the event any of you live in the area, this is the address (it's on the second floor of the Wintergreen Plaza):
