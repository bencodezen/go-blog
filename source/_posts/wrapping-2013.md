Hey everyone. I thought I would go ahead and give an update as to where I stand at the moment. First and foremost, I would like state very clearly: **I am not leaving the world of go or shutting down the go blog. **I apologize for giving that notion in my last [Friday Go Forward](http://www.bengozen.com/friday-go-forward-week-44/ "Friday Go Forward: Week 44"). So in an attempt to clarify what's going on, I have decided to write this post.

Over the past couple of weeks, things have been really crazy. Unexpected work projects, opportunities, and crazy hours sprouted out of nowhere. In addition, a last minute trip to California forced me to really reconsider where I am in life and what my priorities are. As a result, the blog's regularly generated content (i.e., Monday Go Meditation, Weekly Go Wednesday, and Friday Go Forward) went on hiatus.

The reason for this is quite simple. My writing schedule has been to produce each weekly blog content a week in advance so that the content is consistent. However, this leaves little room for flexibility when you consider the way life likes to throw curve balls. In addition, it takes much more time (than my brain is willing to admit) to generate content that I think will be worth your time. (Or well, I would like to believe it's at least somewhat worth your time. Haha. xD)

To be honest, while I am somewhat proud of myself for being able to last this long on the blog with consistent content, I am still disappointed that I wasn't able to keep it going a little longer. So, in order to prevent this from happening again, I am taking the month of December to really get my affairs in order and revise my system so that it's a little more "life-proof" in preparation for 2014\. If you have any suggestions or ideas for things you might like to see in 2014, be sure to let me know!

Meanwhile, you can expect to see a number of reviews pop up over the next few weeks along with any random ramblings that I might be inspired to write. =D Until then, hope that everything is well with everyone and I'm looking forward to hearing any suggestions or comments on what you might like to see when 2014 rolls around. Ciao!
