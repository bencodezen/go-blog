As some of you know, Gu Li and Lee Sedol recently had their second game in their [jubango](http://www.bengozen.com/gu-li-lee-sedol-jubango/ "Gu Li and Lee Sedol Jubango"). And because the feedback on [my review of Gu Li and Lee Sedol's first jubango game](http://www.bengozen.com/wgw-31-gu-li-vs-lee-sedol-jubango-game-1-amateur-review/ "WGW 31: Gu Li vs Lee Sedol — Jubango Game 1 Amateur Review") was positive, I am happy to announce that I will continue reviewing every game from this jubango! Before we get into the review itself though, there are a couple of things I wanted to mention.

1.  In response to your feedback from [my review of Gu Li and Lee Sedol's first jubango game](http://www.bengozen.com/wgw-31-gu-li-vs-lee-sedol-jubango-game-1-amateur-review/ "WGW 31: Gu Li vs Lee Sedol — Jubango Game 1 Amateur Review"), this review was created to include more of my reactions and thoughts on the game as opposed to simply trying to "teach people what's going on."
2.  However, I do want to emphasize that I still believe firmly in providing a thorough breakdown of the game in order to allow players of all strengths to be able to follow the game and gain more enjoyment from it. So continuing with the same format as before, there is commentary for every single move regardless of how "obvious" it might seem.
3.  Though frozensoul and I were able to combine forces on the first game, I was unable to get together with him in time for me to release this post. So this game review is solely my doing and therefore all ideas and analyses come from the best I have in my SDK brain. Hopefully in the future I'll be able to collaborate with him and/or other stronger players as well.
4.  <span style="line-height: 1.5em;">For more advanced reviews, be sure to keep an eye out on </span>[World Go Online](http://www.kiseido.com/printss/guliten1.html "World Go Online Review of Jubango Game 1")<span style="line-height: 1.5em;"> and </span>[GoGameGuru](http://gogameguru.com/lee-sedol-races-ahead-2-0-gu-li-vs-lee-sedol-jubango/ "GoGameGuru Review of Jubango Game 2")<span style="line-height: 1.5em;"> since I'm sure they will have their own in the near future.</span>
I hope that you enjoy the review and improved format. Be sure to leave comments as the format is still a work in progress and I am always trying to make the reading experience a more enjoyable one for you![

**Update: There is a correction to the score I reported in the kifu. Due to Chinese counting, the final score was actually a half point win for Lee Sedol. Though it didn't change the result of the game, it definitely only adds to the epicness and excitement of the game!**
