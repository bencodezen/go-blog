## Overview

After trying to go through my training regimen from last week, I realized I was getting bored of practicing the same problems over and over again. And while my intentions were good (since my goal was to make all the problems instinctive), interest and motivation trumps that so I've moved on to more interesting topics to change it up for now. And especially after giving thought to the notion that [tesuji is more important than life and death](http://www.bengozen.com/wgw37-tesuji-more-useful-than-tsumego/ "WGW37: Tesuji More Useful Than Tsumego?"), I really wanted to start studying tesuji once again.

On another note, in case anyone missed it, the [Washington Open](http://www.novagoclub.org/tournaments "Nova Go Club Tournaments Website") is happening this weekend. Yours truly will be attending and competing/participating in whatever I can do. So you can definitely look forward to a series of posts on the event. I'm a little nervous because I haven't really been playing as much as I should have, but I'll have to brush that aside and just go to have as much fun as I can. If I can play really interesting games, then I will consider this event to be a success. See you all next week!

PS. In case you didn't know, fellow go player Risingstar just started his own [blog](http://gosimplycomplex.blogspot.com/ "RisingStar"), so be sure to check it out and support him as we try and bolster go's presence online!
