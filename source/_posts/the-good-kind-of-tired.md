I just got back from the Japanese Embassy where I got a chance to meet and play Japanese proÂ Narumi Osawa (4p). Although the event went differently than I expected, it was a unique experience in that she mainly spoke Japanese and therefore I had to rely on translations and my best interpretations of what she was aiming at. Although I haven't processed a lot of it yet, it feels like something else clicked tonight. Hard to say what, but although I'm quite tired, it was a great experience that I look forward to reflecting on. More on this Thursday...
