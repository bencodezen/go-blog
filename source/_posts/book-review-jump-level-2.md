### Before I Read This Book...

Around this time, my reading skills and knowledge was around 4-5 kyu. I have had a lot of success with this series up to this point, so I was looking forward to what skills I would be training next.

### My Review

In this volume of the Jump Level Up Series, you will find the usual sample openings and introduction of a couple joseki along with a heavy emphasis on training techniques in capture stones. Whether this is through eye space reduction, shortage of liberties, or ways to get ahead in capturing races, there is certainly a lot to be learned and trained in this book. Other sections that may be of interest to others include finding effective connections along with an introduction of some endgame techniques as well. There is a section on ko in here as well, but it is not very robust and one should not expect too much from it. Overall however, the book has continued to live up to my expectations for this series and I would highly recommend it!

### Synopsis

**What did I enjoy about the book?**

*   Lots of training on capturing techniques.
*   It forces you to really get comfortable with capturing races.
*   Continues to provide the format and quality of content you come to expect from the series.

**What did I gain from reading this book?**

*   Improved ability to identify ways to get ahead in capturing races.
*   Some new endgame techniques that I have started to look for in my actual games.
*   Improved overall reading ability.

**What is the format of the book?**

*   The book is primarily structured as follows: (1) A one page explanation of the topic that you are about to practice. Example: When behind in liberties. They not only show the sequence for the proper technique, but also include common mistakes and brief explanations as to why they are mistakes. (2) A set of very easy to understand and follow practice problems to ensure you understand what you are learning.

**What aspect can be improved on?**

*   On two occasions, a problem that is beyond the scope of what I was practicing popped up. Problems #23 and #24 on Page 151. This was rather left-field and threw me off quite a bit. I would recommend against these sort of problems since it can be discouraging to those without an answer book.

**Is this book easy to read?**

*   Yes. It doesn't get much more simple or straightforward than this.

**Bottom Line**

1.  Continues to live to the high expectations I have for this series.

2.  An incredible way for players to immerse themselves and gain the ability to actually apply the concepts they are learning to their own games.

3.  Worth the money!

### Recommended For...

*   Though the series is designed for kids, both kids and adults alike will be able to learn everything they need to know about playing go in a fun and entertaining way.
*   People who enjoy learning things in an easy to understand format and lots of opportunities to reinforce what they are learning.
