## Overview

Whew. I’m hitting the one month milestone in my training and I’m proud to say that things are still going well. Granted, there are times where I almost skipped out on my regimen, but my past self was smart enough to keep it at a manageable level where the task was easy enough that it wasn’t onerous to complete.

And as a brief update to my game playing, it still has yet to really increase to anything significant, but it seems I’ve actually managed at least 2 games a week for the past couple of weeks! That’s quite exciting when you consider how I was avoiding games entirely at one point. One step at a time right? And on top of that, I forgot to mention that one of my games this week was ranked! Against a bot I know, but it was the best I could bring myself to do since I wanted to get rid of the question mark in my rank on KGS. Still, better than nothing right? Haha.

Things are starting to pick up in other aspects of my life, so the true test to my training regimen starts here. And while this usually did not bode well for my go pursuits, I have a feeling that it will be very different this time around.

## Daily Training Regimen

*   Complete 4 pages of problems (approximately 15-20 problems) from Jump Level Up.
*   Playing at least one game a day (which usually defaults to a 9x9 game on GoQuest).
