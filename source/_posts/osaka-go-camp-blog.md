I'm going to break my general rule of not posting twice in a day because the AGA newsletter has informed me of an awesome blog that I couldn't wait to share with you!

[Osaka Go Camp Blog](http://osakago.blogspot.com)

Here's the basic rundown: A group of western go players are attending a 3-week go gamp in Osaka!!!!!!! They get to do all sorts of cool things like visit the Kansai Kiin and play with professional players!!! Ahhh!!!! Soooo cool!!!!!!

Of course I'm insanely jealous, but for those like me who probably won't be able to travel to Japan anytime soon for a go retreat, this blog is a great way to get a taste of it for now. =)
