## Friday Go Forward: Week 39

## Overview

Since last week, I've been cutting down significantly on turn based games. I found that playing too many at once was really interfering with my ability to play better moves and not to mention takes up more time. And with everything else in my life kicking into gear, my training regimen got completely screwed up so I won't be reporting on it this week. However, I've also come up with a new way to track how I've been spending my time on go and will be updating my training menu next week once I've gotten a better hang of it.

Another relatively big decision on my part was to finally return to playing live games on KGS. It has been too long and I've decided that trying to wait to play a game with the time settings I desired was only hurting me in the long run. So you can definitely look forward to seeing more games being populated in my list of kifu on KGS in the future.

Finally, there's been a launch for an online go magazine called [Formation Magazine](http://www.formationmag.com/vol_1_iss_1/). It seems to be a new effort to provide an in-depth online magazine for the world to peruse and read. Though there are some design issues that I have with it, it seems like it could turn into something really valuable for the go community in the long run. So be sure to check it out and see what you think! [
