[expand title="Before I Read This Book..." trigclass="expandTitle"]

**My Abilities**

*   A mid to high SDK (single digit kyu) kyu who has read his fair share of go books and has a pretty strong foundation in the basics and teaching go.
**My Perspective**

*   After Level Up 3, I was expecting things to start to start getting more difficult; but hopefully still manageable.

[expand title="My Review" trigclass="expandTitle" expanded="true"]

**What did I enjoy about the book?**

*   I enjoyed that they use "next move" questions that provide a mini-simulation of what kind of decisions you might make in a game.
*   When drilling life and death shapes, they spare no effort in making sure you not only know where the vital point of the shape is, but how to create the shape when killing your opponent or avoiding offering the opponent a chance to create the shape.
*   Does a great job introducing dame (aka neutral) points and giving the reader opportunities to practice finding them along with how to be careful about how accidentally filling the wrong dame points can actually cause problems.
*   Introduces "endgame" at its most basic level: closing off or reducing territory.
**What did I gain from reading this book?**

*   Continued polishing my reading abilities - particularly shortage of liberties and nets.
**What style of teaching does the book use?**

*   Curriculum Style

		*   Content is organized into lessons, topics, or themes in order to facilitate learning.

*   Primary Learning Mechanism:

		*   Practice problems.

*   Other Learning Mechanisms:

		*   Simple explanations accompanied by equally simple diagrams.
		*   Fun comics to help explain concepts like the net.
**What aspect can be improved on?**

*   Up to this point, the answer books have been great on its own. For this book however, I noticed that there were times where answers to questions that asked the reader "Which direction to block?" would be best served if there were a short explanation as to why. Granted, this may be omitted due to it being used in a school setting where a go teacher would explain it; but if the answer books are intended to be sufficient without a teacher, then this would be very helpful.
**Is this book easy to read?**

*   Yes. It was very easy to understand all the explanations and progress through the book.

[expand title="Recommended For..." trigclass="expandTitle"]

*   Though the series is designed for kids, both kids and adults alike will be able to learn everything they need to know about playing go in a fun and entertaining way.
*   People who enjoy learning things in an easy to understand format and lots of opportunities to reinforce what they are learning.
