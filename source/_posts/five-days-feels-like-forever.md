It's been five days since I last played a game of go, but it has felt like an eternity. Haha. I found myself logging onto KGS multiple times a day to look at game records of my friends or watch other games just to prevent myself from getting entangled in a game. It doesn't quite measure up to playing, but it helped to satisfy the urge to just play. I'm looking forward to my game with Nate tomorrow, but I'll probably be avoiding ranked games for a little.

In terms of what I've been up to, I'm actually working pretty hard on getting this blog's redesign ready for launch. I'm aiming for launching in the beginning of November, but we'll see how it goes. I'm aiming to bring a big change to the blog that will improve the blog's experience and quality of information.

In addition, while working on the redesign has its own fun and adventure, I've been trying to expand my understanding of go theory. I had been trying to work on my reading abilities through The Elementary Go Series: <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Tesuji</span> and <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Life and Death</span>, but I was getting bored and unable to focus. So instead of trying to mindlessly finish the books, I moved on to more theoretical based books such as <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Attack and Defense</span> and <span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Power of the Star Point</span>Â for now. (Don't get me wrong though. I'm still working on tsumego, just nothing mind bending at the moment.)

If anyone has any ideas or suggestions for the blog redesign, please be sure to let me know! All comments and feedback would be greatly appreciated!
