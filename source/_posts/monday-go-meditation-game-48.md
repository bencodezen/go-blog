summary: >
	<p>For this week's go meditation, there are only two words that would aptly describe the violence in this game: bloodshed everywhere... Although this may look odd since my opponent is 2k and I'm 4k, this is around the time I got promoted to 3k on KGS. So in reality it's a one stone difference between us and the fact is that we have had a long standing history of having violent games. Be sure to grab your popcorn as you watch the violence unfold on the board. Enjoy.</p>
