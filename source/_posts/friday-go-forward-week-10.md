## Thoughts

I'm happy to announce that the [StudyGroupKyu](http://www.studygroupkyu.org) site went live this week! There are still some enhancements to be made, and that will continue to take up my time; but it's been fun to combine my love for design with go. Definitely hoping to do more of that as time goes on.

With that being said, this week has a decently studious week combined with sporadic blitz go. Now although none of the game time settings will indicate that, I generally didn't spend more than 30 seconds on a move. This is probably due to my lack of time and newly acquired ability to not be attached to winning or losing a game. I've been more obsessed with trying out new things and experimenting with what I've been learning. And to be honest, it's quite refreshing.
