I mentioned recently that I wanted to turn my attention Tygem because of how different the players are there. I tried explaining it to a friend a night or two ago but couldn't find the right game to really illustrate it.

Well, after talking with frozensoul today, I thought I'd fire up one of my old dan level accounts on Tygem and take a stab at playing on it again.

Oy vey... the epitome of aggressiveness occurred tonight. Invade... fight.... invade... attach... die.... invade... fight... ahhhh......

I think I've lost like 5+ games in a row now. While I feel like I'm on a bit of an emotional tilt from getting pulverized game after game, I think it's good medicine to offset my victory at the [Washington Baduk Open Championship](http://www.bengozen.com/1st-washington-open-baduk-championship-part-ii/ "1st Washington Open Baduk Championship — Part II").

Perhaps it's the fact that I haven't played much, or maybe it's just that I'm really weak against Korean players. In fact, as I think back to the games I lost, I think the bottom line is that they were able to outfight me and play much sharper moves each time (which ended up killing me constantly). I tried to swing by with all my might, but it was like I was poking them with a sewing needle and then came down on me with a two handed axe.

Ah well. They say to lose your first 100 games when you start playing right? Looks like I'll be starting that exercise up again as I dive back into the war zone. *deep breath* See you on the other side.
