As much as I hate to do this, BenGoZen will be on hiatus for the rest of the month to prepare for a brand new blog redesign. I am currently working really hard to not only implement a brand new look and feel for the blog, but I'm also completely revising and improving the information architecture and content quality to make the entire experience more enjoyable and worthy of your time!

To get you excited for some of the new changes coming in a week, here are some things you can expect to see!

1.  Subscribe via email and RSS with ease!
2.  Eidogo Player back in full functionality so that you no longer have to leave the blog to see my games!
3.  Easy translator widget that will allow you to view my content in many languages! (Although I won't be able to verify fully the accuracy of the translation, the content will now be available to more people!)
4.  New integrated comment system that will allow you to login from various social media avenues.

**Looking forward to seeing you on the grand opening - Halloween, October 31st, 2012!**
