Hey everyone. Just wanted to let you know I'm still alive and well. Been getting into some really interesting projects these past few weeks and have been really pondering what I can do with blogging again since I miss doing it. And as someone who hates it when a regular blogger just drops out of the blogosphere, you can rest assured that I won't ever just leave the blog hanging in the event I need to close up shop for awhile.

In terms of what I've been up to, I've been tinkering again with daily regimens and playing games via [DGS](http://www.dragongoserver.net "Dragon Go Server") and [OGS](http://www.online-go.com "Online Go Server") while concurrently juggling a new job and trying to learn a ton of new skills. I've gone all the way back down to the very basics of doing only 10 life and death problems a day. They're not hard in any sense of the word, but they help me to keep a connection to the world of go.

And as a special treat for those who miss my reviews, I've decided to try reviewing one of my 9x9 games that I played recently on GoQuest via an awesome new social kifu reviewing software called [GoKibitz](http://www.gokibitz.com "GoKibitz") that a close friend and long time rival built himself. So I hope you enjoy the review and I will try and post again soon!

UPDATE: Apparently all my comments got lost in the abyss of the internet.... Oy vey... I'll try and get another version up soon....
