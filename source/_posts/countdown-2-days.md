So I apologize to those who keep up with this blog to check out my games and progress, but don't worry... only three more days of this hiatus. I'm training like there is no tomorrow. Thoroughly enjoying reading Lessons in Fundamentals of Go though. What an amusing writer, my favorite so far is when he references the concept of a single stone invading the opponent's territory and how it is analogous to the lone hero walking into the enemy base and destroying like forty opponents... as a martial arts fan.... I can so relate. =D
