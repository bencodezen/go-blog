It's only Day 2 of my [Korean Training Reboot](http://www.bengozen.com/korean-training-reboot/ "Korean Training Reboot!") and I'm happy to report that I am really enjoying this series. Although I could theoretically fly through most of the beginning books, I have been taking more time to be very thorough with the content. I'm hoping that this will help to reveal any inconsistencies with my basics as I work my way through the series.

In terms of progress though, I'm almost done with _Level Up! - Volume 1 _and plan to post the review in the near future. For my preliminary findings though, I'm 99% sure that this series will be awarded the best introductory series to go in my book. Although it might be written and designed for kids, I have a feeling that any adult who goes through this entire series will rise through the ranks much faster than by studying any other book.

This is just a preliminary analysis though, so I will let you know if my opinion changes when I'm done with the series. =D
