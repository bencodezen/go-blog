For your final October Bonus Game Review, you will have the opportunity to witness another one of my Tygem games against a 3d! In all honesty, I was quite surprised at some of the moves I made when I was reviewing it again. Some were quite innovative, while some were quite idiotic. Haha. Hopefully this game will be full of fun and surprises for you as you prepare for your own Halloween celebrations. I hope you have enjoyed this bonus series and hope you have a great Halloween tomorrow!
