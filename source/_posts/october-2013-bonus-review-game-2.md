For your second bonus game review, we will be continuing with my second game from the Canada Go League! Similar to what I mentioned in [last week's game](http://www.bengozen.com/october-2013-bonus-review-game-1/ "October 2013 Bonus Review — Game 1"), though my opponent was supposed to be in the 5-6 kyu range, I was not going to be underestimate my opponent.

Overall, this game is a good illustration of recognizing when to tenuki and how it is important not to let your opponent seal you in without good reason. In addition, I hope that this game will help you see my decision process when trying to figure out whether something is worth responding to or not. Hope you enjoy![
