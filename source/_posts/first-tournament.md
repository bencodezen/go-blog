So the UMBC Go Tournament was the first tournament I helped to run and play in. What a fortunate occasion! Anyhow, it was a bit of craziness trying to transport everything. I need to figure out a better system for the future (although thank goodness I had portable carts, an empty box, and an empty luggage).

**Tournament Summary**: We had about 20 people show up. It was apparently not a huge showing but I think it was pretty good for a tournament that was planned and announced within a month. We'll aim for better next time.

**Results**: Justin Teng and Jason Long took 1st place in their respective divisions. How did I do? 0-3\. (There was an odd number of players in Round 2 so I dropped out for that round).

**Overview**: The first two games I lost were against SDKs. I took no handicap against the first match which proved to be disadvantageous but I don't think I played poorly. In the other SDK game I actually played quite well but my opponent managed to bring a large group back to life. In the final loss against a DDK, there was a lot of fighting but I spread myself out too thin.

**Meta-Analysis**: I'm happy with my results. I played interesting games where I wasn't afraid to jump into questionable territory for fear of not gaining a win. I fought well and believe that my issue is the inability to maintain well balanced play throughout the entire game. That's okay with me, because that means there is very obvious and definite growth in the horizon.

**Take-Away Lesson**: What does it mean to lose? What does it mean to win? There's a scene in Hikaru no Go where Akira's dad (who was considered the best player in that day in age) loss a game against Ogata. And instead of focusing on the fact that he lost, the audience focused on the fact that his game of Go had taken a new life and was evolving in new and exciting ways. That's the way one should view the results. It's always nice to have a solid win, but growing and learning from your game is the only we can progress not only on the board, but in life as well.
