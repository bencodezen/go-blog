summary:
	<p>For today's go meditation, we continue with another game between cloudbrows and myself! Though not nearly as explosive as the last game we played, I think that this game is an excellent example of poor attacking along and the importance of whole board thinking. In addition, I am trying to expand the breadth of the review with more commentary than before in hopes of expanding the range of players that will be able to understand and gain something from my reviews. Let me know if there's anything more I can do!</p>
