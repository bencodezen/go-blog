**What's the best aspect about this product?**

*   Light-weight and super affordable!
**What is the weakest aspect of this product?**

*   Upon close inspection, the lines are not as clean as you'll see on more expensive boards; but it still does the job well!
**Is it durable?**

*   After handling it, I see no reason why it won't hold up to normal usage. However, if somewhere were to try and karate chop this board, I'm pretty sure it'd break. xD
**Bottom Line**

1.  A great go board for someone on a budget!
2.  And in the event you know how to play Chinese chess, there's a board of that on the back as well!
3.  Definitely recommended over paper and/or plastic boards that exist out there!

[expand title="My Review" trigclass="expandTitle" expanded="true"]

Here's the front of the board at a slanted angle. It's a nice yellow color to give it a semi-shin-kaya feel. (I prefer the yellow color over brown since it shows more contrast when stones are placed on the board; but that's just a personal preference.)

And here below, you can see that there's a Chinese chess board on the back!

Upon closer inspection, you'll see that the lines are not perfectly straight the way you'll see on higher quality boards. However, I wouldn't let this be a deterrent from purchasing the board if it's being used for casual play.

Here are a couple of shots with the board in action with my size 36 glass stones. As you can see, the lines are not so obvious from a player's perspective.

Bottom line: I highly recommend this board for people who are looking to purchase boards for their club or for tournaments. This board would also function well as a casual study/playing board. However, I would definitely not recommend this as a primary goban for anyone who is looking for that classic air and sound you get from true wooden boards. So remember, the key thing to remember is that this is a board that focuses on affordability and practicality.
