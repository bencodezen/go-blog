So lately, I've been playing pool with my family, and I have to say that I realized how accustomed I've become to the manner of play in go. For those who aren't familiar with pool, a player can theoretically play the entire game from start to finish without ever letting the opponent have a single turn. Can you imagine how I felt as a go player?! It's as if I passed every time an opponent put down a stone. AHHHHHHH!!!!!

With that random anecdote, I'm still happy to report that my ranked game sabbatical has continued to be sustain. Although in all honesty, with the league games diminishing in availability, I am starting to feel the urge to start playing ranked games again. I've even resorted to playing two games of blitz go yesterday (which was a complete and utter mistake might I add). Â Playing league games consistently has certainly weakened my ability to play blitz go properly, but I think that's a plus more than a negative.

On that note, the month is nearly over! I'm not sure whether or not I want to continue abstaining from ranked games or not, so I guess I'll see when the time comes.

Hope everyone had a great holiday!
