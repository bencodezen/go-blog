## Overview

I have to say that if you asked me two weeks ago whether or not I'd be in the midst of getting the go blog back and running, I would have told you that you were crazy because I was in the middle of five other things. Nonetheless, here we are and I'm very happy to be back in the thick of things.

This week has been focused on simply getting reacquainted with everything again. That means figuring out the apps I'm using to train, books to read, styles to study, trends I missed, and other things as well. That said, it's been wonderful seeing familiar faces in the community again and I can't wait to settle into another step towards gaining that next stone.
