I'm happy to report that my ranked game today went very well. Each move was calculated and had an intended purpose. There were a few mistakes in my reading here and there, but overall it was a success when you consider some of my previous ranked games from a little while ago. So here's to hoping that the [tweak](http://www.bengozen.com/the-6k-screwup/ "The 6k Screwup")Â I've made to the ranked games I play will allow me to begin to achieve my actual rank (whatever it is).

As I continue to work towards achieving solid dan status, I have noticed that it is definitely becoming more difficult to improve. It's not so much that it is "hard," but the difficult lies in the fact that the proper steps to get stronger become hazy as you climb the ladder. It's no longer as simple as improving your reading and having a better grasp of life and death. The more I have my games reviewed, the more I realize that I need to begin grasping and utilizing ideas like aji in order to reach the next level.

Like anything else though, first thing first: **Achieve solid 4k status before March**.
