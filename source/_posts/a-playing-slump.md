It seems I've hit a bit of a playing slump recently. Every time I'm asked to play a game, I find myself turning down most games (except in rare cases where frozen or a friend asks for a game).

It's not so much that I don't like playing anymore, but each time I want to start a game, I have this nagging feeling that something else needs to be done or start feeling worried that I'll be interrupted. After all, a full game of go for me can easily take anywhere from 1.5 to 2 hours without skipping a beat. And frankly, life has not been too lenient in terms of giving me 2 hour blocks of time to play a game of go. As a result, I've been rather hesitant lately to play any ranked/tournament games for fear of needing to leave, resign, or rush the game.

For those who have been following, that is a recipe for disaster for my go. Odds are very good that I will end up regretting the game I played.Â So to avoid me possibly going on tilt or becoming frustrated, I've been doing a bit of reading, studying, watching, and reviewing other people's games in order to get my go fix. Although I know it isn't quite the same as playing the game, my little workaround will have to suffice until life eases up a bit.
