## Overview

This week has been a little light in regards to playing, but I got a chance to participate in the MD Open (which I will post about tomorrow) and gain some really valuable insight from my sensei frozensoul. Some of the ideas are still sort of jumbled and not clearly integrated in my play yet; but this week has felt like a big shift for me in terms of my perspective of the game in addition to taking one step closer to sharpening my blade.

## Games

*   Tournament - 2 games (2 wins: 0 losses)
*   <span style="line-height: 13px;">KGS - 1 game (0 wins : 1 loss)</span>
*   DGS - 2 ongoing games
*   Nova - 2 ongoing games

## Training

*   <span style="line-height: 13px;">20 tsumego problems each day.</span>
*   Finished _Mastering the Basics: The Basics of Go Strategy_.
*   Started and working on _Mastering the Basics: Ko._
*   Working on _Kage's Secret Chronicles of Handicap Go._

## Lessons Learned

1.  Being able to treat forcing moves as light stones has made a world of difference in my play.
2.  I am starting to understand how to exploit aji in conjunction with forcing moves and probes.
3.  Being able to estimate territory (even to only some accuracy) has really helped me figure out what I need to do to possibly win the game.
