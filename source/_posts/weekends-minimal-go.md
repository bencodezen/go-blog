Come to think of it, I barely have any time to study or play Go on weekends... particularly playing it... I'm not sure whether that's a good or bad thing... but anyhow, my first book on <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Opening Theory Made Easy</span> is now finished! Muahaha.... I will get that review up asap. Â Meanwhile, onto the other books!
