## Friday Go Forward: Week 38

## Overview

Overall, this week has been a continuation of me just trying to figure out what kind of studying works best in the time I have.  Though I am far from releasing a user guide of sorts, the one advice that I am sure will not change is this: Start small. Whether it's only 5 minutes every day to sit down and do a couple tsumego or go over ten moves of a pro game, it will add up over time. That much I can promise you. =)

And by the way, the BadukTV English from GoGamGuru continues to impress me with how little I know even though I'm technically 3-4 kyu KGS. Even though I'm more than halfway through the "Becoming 5 Kyu" series, I am just flabbergated

## Games

*   KGS -  3 games
*   DGS - 3 ongoing games
*   Nova -  10+ games

## Training Menu

*   20 minutes of Reading Training (i.e., Life &amp; Death, Tesuji, etc.)
*   20 minutes of Go Theory Study (i.e., Joseki, Direction of Play, etc.)
