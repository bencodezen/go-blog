## Overview

Once again I've decided to trim down on my training regimen in order to up the quality of training. This means more time spent on each topic as well as increasing repetition in order to further solidify what I'm learning. In other words, I'm no longer simply looking to find out what the correct answer is; but to instead really try to immerse myself in it so the reading ability becomes more ingrained in me.

In terms of gameplay, it has been a rather abysmal week. I got into a weird mood and ended up losing 5 games in a row. It was pretty awful considering my go deteriorated to the point where my final game was a resignation against a 4k. Playing on tilt is just not a pretty sight for me at all. Haha. But on the upside, I did manage to recollect myself enough to manage a win for my [Yunguseng Dojang](http://www.yunguseng.com "Yunguseng Dojang Official Site") match. So hooray for that!

And as [mentioned earlier this week](http://www.bengozen.com/taking-second-look-blog/ "Taking a Second Look at the Blog"), there are some changes coming up on the blog that should hopefully improve the reading experience and value that this blog has. So I've been working on that as well and trying to iron out some of the changes I'm trying to make. Fingers crossed it goes smoothly!

## Training Regimen

*   Play 3 games a week.

*   Work on [Get Strong at Tesuji](http://www.bengozen.com/book-review-get-strong-tesuji/ "Book Review: Get Strong at Tesuji").

## Lessons Learned

*   Playing on tilt has consequences... like dropping two stones in rank on KGS. Hahaha.
*   Take all your opponents seriously regardless of their rank. I've posted about this multiple times, but it's come to bite me in the butt again.
*   There is a huge difference between winning a game and crushing your opponent. Taking one attitude versus another has a profound impact on your approach to the game mentally, but more on this later.
*   This might sound utterly basic, but I seriously need to use my brain more when I play. I miss the most common variations in my blitz reading. I read one variation and think it's good and fail to consider other obvious alternatives. Oy vey.
