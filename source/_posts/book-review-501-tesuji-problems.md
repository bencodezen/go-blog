### What I Expected

*   A section explaining various tesujis along with a few easy problems in each section to get your brain moving.
*   A problem section that consisted of an assortment of the tesujis from the first portion of the book.

### What You Can Expect

*   <span style="line-height: 13px;">Problems along with their usual solutions, but that is all.</span>

### My Thoughts as a 5 Kyu

When I first reviewed this book, I will admit that my initial findings were rather negative since I was really disappointed in the fact that it did not follow the same structure that the other books in the series had. As a result, you will have to forgive me for knocking it down a few pegs.

The book delivers on the promise that you will practice a lot of problems in hopes of training your brain to find tesujis without being told what to do. While I understand the merits in this approach, I still firmly believe that the book would be far more effective if it kept to the format of the Mastering the Basics series.

So if you're looking for a book that gives explanations and guidance on tesujis, this is definitely not the book for you. On the other hand, if you want a book of pure tesuji problems, then you've come to the right place.
