![Stress Relief Kit](/images/2010/10/stress-relief-kit.png)

It seems I can't seem to get my wrapped up properly in a game tonight. Every time I try to play online, it has been a miserable game each and every time. I always start out playing solid, and then always seem to mess up later on.

On the upside, playing with Todd and Keith today was insightful and I learned a lot. It's still frustrating how little I feel that I've grown in the (almost) two months time frame. I clearly haven't been studying as much as I should have been lately. I should probably modify my regimen for improving my abilities.

Five more days until the second month is up.... sigh....
