## Introduction

In continuation of the [last MGM](http://www.bengozen.com/monday-go-meditation-game-13/ "Monday Go Meditation: Game 13"), today's game is another 2 stone handicap game where I play White and endure a difficult battle. On the upside though, I am happy to report that handicap games are starting to become less fearsome as time goes on. And to clarify, it's not so much that I'm sure that I can win; but I see the handicap stones as more of a complicated obstacle course instead of a huge tower of death where I am sure to lose.

## **One Point Lesson**
