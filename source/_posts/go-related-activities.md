So it seems that this week will definitely not be nearly as productive in regards to playing games as last week. Although it will be game light, here are some of the things I am working on:

1.  <span style="line-height: 13px;">Giving the Equipment section a complete makeover in order to improve the look and feel and to maximize its usefulness to anyone looking to purchase go equipment or books!</span>
2.  Designing the first layout for the new [StudyGroupKyu](http://studygroupkyutournament.webs.com/) website in preparation for the April tournament launch!
3.  Continuing my study of all the go books I have so that I can add more books to the book review section!
I'll be sure to post updates when the new Equipment section are updated for your comments and critiques!
