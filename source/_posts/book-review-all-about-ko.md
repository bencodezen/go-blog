### My Thoughts as a 5 Kyu

To begin, I'd like to clarify that I was not able to fully study and absorb all the material in this book. There are an array of reasons for this, but the primary one being that I have very little motivation to actually learn all the details about ko since I feel that I still have a wide gap in the rest of my go knowledge that mastery of ko would not be very rewarding at this point in time.

For those who have looked at the Table of Contents, it is very clear that that Zeijst and Bozulich both took great care to make sure just about every aspect of ko was covered. Granted, while some of the sections are rather short (e.g., a few pages), the explanation are concise and clear enough that the brevity of the section will not hamper your learning ability.

Finally, this is the first book I'm recommending for dan players and above. There is a really big reason for this: mastering ko battles is _utterly useles_s for kyu players unless they already have a solid understanding of everything else already (e.g., positional judgment, attacking and defending properly, direction of play, etc.). And based on what I've heard from stronger players, kyu players would be dan level if they already had a solid grasp of the other fundamentals of the game.

If you really want to get this book however, I would recommend simply reading the explanations on the various aspects of ko; but don't spend an exorbitant amount of time on the problems.
