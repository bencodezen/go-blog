## Introduction

And we're back for the second week of Thursday Go Tygem! Unfortunately since the last game, I was demoted to 2d. No matter though! The opponents are still dans, so we march onwards!

This game I take White against a 2d. The opening starts out with a terrible exchange on my part, and then a crazy fight for supremacy in the middle game breaks out after he makes a mistake in trying to cut apart my groups. Definitely a game that demonstrates how kiai (i.e., fighting spirit) can make a big difference in a position where you are initially at a disadvantage.

As always, please let me know if there is anything I can do to improve this series for you guys!

no,Category,Good,Bad
1,Opening,**Moves 44:** Was proud to find this move to resist Black’s attempt to get an overwhelming advantage in the opening.,**Move 18+:** The push cut exchange made me over-concentrated and in bad position.
2,Middle Game,Overall it felt like the middle game was in my favor and I outplayed my opponent.,**Move 168:** Avoiding the ko was so indescribably bad because there was no ko. *hangs head in shame* Could have been such an easy game...
3,Fighting,**Move 122+:** I was quite proud to be able to fight on even grounds in such close proximity here.,**Move 168:** So shameful it gets restated twice. Just so bad.
4,Endgame,**Move 212:** I was proud to find this attachment quickly to reduce Black’s area., Can’t say I was great at identifying the biggest value on the board; but tried to use sente/gote moves as my points of reference.
5,Overall Reading,**Move 80:** Outreading Black by knowing the cut didn’t work was very satisfying.,**Move 188:** This should have been at R3 to make life in the corner and would have changed the result of the game.
