## Introduction

For the second Monday Go Meditation of 2014, I thought it would be great to feature the game where my sensei (frozensoul) and I played a game together online. While this was not rengo, it was a really interesting experience to have frozensoul's input on the game while I was playing. You very quickly come to realize how differently high dan level players actually think. I hope that you enjoy this game and see the difference I'm talking about. =D

## **One Point Lesson**

It's okay if your opponent keeps trying to kill your probe stone, it's actually really hard to truly silence it.
