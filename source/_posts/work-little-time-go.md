I had a feeling this would happen sooner or later, but it seems that that time is now: work has really taken over my life. On the upside though, for those who don't really know much about me, I really enjoy what I'm doing and I'm learning a lot. So it's not a bad thing for the most part. The only part that kind of sucks is I don't really have the time I want to have to devote to go.

No worries though. I have no plans on disappearing from the blog any time soon. If I need to take a sabbatical, I'll make sure to post about it before I do so that it doesn't seem like I dropped off the face of the earth. =) In the meantime, I'll be focusing on trying to work on my reviews and the books I have waiting for me to read and review. Until then, best of luck in your studies and in your games and hopefully you'll see me online from time to time!
