## Overview

Hey everyone. Sorry for not updating the weekly status report for the last two weeks. I’ve been doing a bit of introspection and came to the realization that everything had started to become a bit too mundane for my liking. I know that this runs slightly counter to my whole notion of “consistency,” but I feel like there comes a point when it becomes robotic (which is the last thing I want for this blog).

So as you’ve probably noticed, the official “Journal Entries” series was killed off since I felt like it was somewhat a repetition of this weekly status report. In addition, because I hadn’t been investing as much time in go as I would like, it felt like I was saying the same thing over and over again.

Well forget all that. I’m going back to the basics and my roots as a blogger. Can’t quite articulate what that exactly entails, but I can tell you for sure that I am feeling a change in the wind. It’s going to be an exciting ride!
