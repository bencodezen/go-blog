## Friday Go Forward: Week 29

## Overview

So I'm going to change up the format of my progress report in hopes of determining my own training menu and give you better insight into what I'm doing each week. Instead of an "Education and Training" section, I've split it up into "Training" and "Reading Material" so there is a clear distinction of what I'm actively doing. My training regimen is far from what I would like it to be at the moment, but my goal this week has been to establish consistent and disciplined habits in order to make continuous gains. I'm sure I will still find wrinkles in my system as I progress, but the key thing I'll have to remember is to always "fail forward!"
