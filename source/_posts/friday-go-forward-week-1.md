## Thoughts

Overall, it's been a rather eventful week since the ASR League was wrapping up and the final points were being tallied. The good news is that I managed to get promoted to Alpha!!! Woot woot! I know that some people will say, "It's easy to get to Alpha. Just play a lot of games." To you I say that may be true if you actually win some of your games, but otherwise it's near impossible since your points rack up so slowly compared to people who win a majority of their games.

Since February is going to be a short month, it seems I will be going on another ranked game sabbatical since I will have my hands full trying to stay in Alpha class and also keeping up with my study schedule for the month. Not to mention that [North American Go Convention](http://www.bengozen.com/north-american-go-convention/ "North American Go Convention!!!")Â is this month as well, and that will take out four days of studying/playing. So lots to do this month, and very little time. Something's got to give right? =) Here's to the start of a crazy month! Ikuzo!
