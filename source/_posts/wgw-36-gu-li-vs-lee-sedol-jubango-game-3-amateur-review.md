## Weekly Go Wednesday: Issue #36

[caption id="attachment_4869" align="aligncenter" width="551"][![Credit to GoGameGuru](http://www.bengozen.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/jubangogame3.jpg)](http://www.bengozen.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/jubangogame3.jpg) Credit to [GoGameGuru](http://gogameguru.com/gu-li-strikes-back-gu-li-vs-lee-sedol-jubango-game-3/ "GoGameGuru Jubango 3 Article")[/caption]

For Game 3 of the epic [jubango](http://www.bengozen.com/gu-li-lee-sedol-jubango/ "Gu Li and Lee Sedol Jubango") between Lee Sedol (9P) and Gu Li (9P), we have arrived at a crucial point. Lee Sedol is already 2-0 ([Game 1](http://www.bengozen.com/wgw-31-gu-li-vs-lee-sedol-jubango-game-1-amateur-review/ "WGW 31: Gu Li vs Lee Sedol — Jubango Game 1 Amateur Review") and [Game 2](http://www.bengozen.com/wgw-33-gu-li-vs-lee-sedol-jubango-game-2-amateur-review/ "WGW 33: Gu Li vs Lee Sedol — Jubango Game 2 Amateur Review")) and there is concern that the jubango will end earlier than desired. After all, everyone wants to see all 10 games. However, the rules of the jubango is that the first to six victories win. As a result, for this game, even Lee Sedol fans were rooting for Gu Li to turn the tide so that we could see more games.

For those who don't keep up with the professional scene, Gu Li had managed to beat Lee Sedol in two other tournament matches prior to this game, so even though there was concern that there would be too much pressure on Gu Li, people had high hopes that Gu Li would be able to make a comeback this game.

As with the previous reviews ([Game 1](http://www.bengozen.com/wgw-31-gu-li-vs-lee-sedol-jubango-game-1-amateur-review/ "WGW 31: Gu Li vs Lee Sedol — Jubango Game 1 Amateur Review") and [Game 2](http://www.bengozen.com/wgw-33-gu-li-vs-lee-sedol-jubango-game-2-amateur-review/ "WGW 33: Gu Li vs Lee Sedol — Jubango Game 2 Amateur Review")), this review continues to be geared towards kyu players who struggle with the advanced analysis and discussion that normally occurs between dan and professional level players. There is commentary for every move so that hopefully you won't ever feel lost. In addition, I am happy to announce that frozensoul (5d) has joined forces with me again for this game review. Many thanks goes out to him for providing a number of the insights you'll see throughout the review.

Just like before, please let me know if you notice anything or have any suggestions that I can do to improve the review. I look forward to getting your feedback on this game review. Hope you enjoy it and learn a thing or two through it!
