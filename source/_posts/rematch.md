One of the fun things about getting to play go on the internet is the fact that you have a lot of opponents to play with. While that is great in a lot of aspects, I used to always get the itch to rematch with opponents so that I could see if I got any better. Call it a grudge if you will, but for me it's usually more of a curiosity than anything else.

Lo and behold, I was granted the opportunity to play against an opponent that I had previously lost to before. When I last played this guy, I lost practically every single fight that I got into. So in hindsight, I think I just wanted to reclaim some of my honor and dignity. =)

As you can see in the game record, I managed to make it out alive with a ~30 point win! Woot woot! Elated feeling for the day: check! Can't let this get to my head too much though, got to keep getting stronger!
