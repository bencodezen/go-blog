Just played against a 6k with a 6 stone handicap (which should have been 8 might I add) and lost due to a misclick. *hangs head in shame* Words can barely describe how blown I feel right now.... so incredibly blown... On the upside though, this may be one of my more interesting games since I managed to hang in there even though I was supposed to given two more stones. Check out the kifu to see my epic fail.

_Update: Upon analysis as a 7k, my 14k self was very wrong about my mistake. The position is seki either way. So there was nothing to be so sad about. :)_
