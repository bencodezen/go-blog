I normally try not to post two games in one day, but tonight I just played a game that blew my mind. I literally went into this game expecting to lose and toy with an idea here or there. Before I knew it though... everything just kind of came together.... It was completely surreal.....

There's only one comment for the entire SGF due to how late it is, but this is perhaps one of the most controlled games I've played to date...
