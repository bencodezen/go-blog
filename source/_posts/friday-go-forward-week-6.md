## Thoughts

Although it seems like a rather light week in terms of playing, I've had a number of teaching games that have been quite eye opening. I haven't yet processed a lot of what has been passed onto me this week, but I hope to take the weekend to look over the kifus and reinforce anything that I learned. On the upside, I've found some really interesting go books that I'm hell bent on trying to finish as soon as possible. More on this next week!
