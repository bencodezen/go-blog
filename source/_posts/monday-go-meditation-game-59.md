	<p>With this week, we continue on with Game #3 of <a href="http://www.thegochallenge.blogspot.com.au/2014/04/april-challenge.html">Maaike's April Challenge</a>! In this game, I am playing a friend who is known for crazy plays and lots of trick plays. So whenever we play a game, I never know what to really expect. Haha. And since my challenge was to play calmly, I thought that my friend would be a great person to test out myself.</p>
