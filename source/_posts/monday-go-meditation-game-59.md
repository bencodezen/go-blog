## Introduction

With this week, we continue on with Game #3 of Maaike's [April Challenge](http://www.thegochallenge.blogspot.com.au/2014/04/april-challenge.html "Maaike")! In this game, I am playing a friend who is known for crazy plays and lots of trick plays. So whenever we play a game, I never know what to really expect. Haha. And since my challenge was to play calmly, I thought that my friend would be a great person to test out myself.

## **One Point Lesson**

When your group is weak, check to see if your opponent has any weak groups that you can counter attack instead of simply trying to run or make life.
