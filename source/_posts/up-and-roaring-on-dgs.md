Thanks to Paul, it seems that I may never ever be in a playing slump ever again. Haha. I am now officially active on [Dragon Go Server](http://www.dragongoserver.net) (DGS)!

The first time I tried playing on DGS, I never turned on the notifications feature and thus could not quite grasp the beauty of turn based go. Now that the feature has been turned on though, I find it pretty exciting when I get an email telling me it's my turn to play.

For those who find that they are a bit short on time and can't block out a couple hours for a good game of go, I completely agree with Paul in that this is a fantastic way to fill the void of not being able to play. In fact, I think there may be some validity in Paul's sentiment of turn based go helping him to improve faster since "a subconcious piece of my mind [is] dwelling on board positions" as he goes about his day. As someone who is starting to play turn based go, I certainly hope he's right!

Especially for those of you who are busy with school and can never find time to play a game with me, I definitely think DGS is the way to go. And to sweeten the deal, there is even a free Android (search for **anDGS**)/iPhone app (search for **Dragon Go Client**) so you can play on the go! My username is bengozen on there as well, so add me and send me an invite for a game! Looking forward to seeing you across the board!
