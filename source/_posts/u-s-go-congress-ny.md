In case anyone doesn't get the [AGA E-Journal](http://www.usgo.org/news/2014/02/u-s-go-congress-coming-to-the-big-apple/), it's been officially announced that Go Congress will be held in New York this year!

For those wondering why I'm so excited, it's because even though I have been blogging for a few years now and played for an equal amount of time, I have never been to a Go Congress.

Yep... So anyhow, unless there is some cosmic force at play that I'm not aware of (where I'm destined to never go to a Go Congress), I will move heaven and earth to go this year. And so if you have any interest in going, please check out the link below and start getting ready for it!
