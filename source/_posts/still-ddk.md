So it seems that even though a lot of time has passed, my rank on KGS still seems to be the same as when I left. It's not so much that I'm slightly concerned that time has not marinated my abilities or anything, but maybe I just need to give it more time.

It seems that my playing lately has been extremely centered on fighting. Kill. Kill Kill. I feel as if the empty triangle devil is much stronger than the angel. Haha.

In order to see whether my hypothesis on my self-destructive tendencies in go hold true, I will be adhering to the following three principles:

1.  Unless I am playing someone I know or am challenged by someone, I will no longer go out to play random online ranked games for the sake of playing.
2.  I will now focus on my patience in the game by training through absolute reading for every single go problem I do.
3.  If I am playing a game, I will read at least 3 moves ahead and determine whether or not the board position is favorable to myself before simply jumping in on impulse.
Let's see how this goes...
