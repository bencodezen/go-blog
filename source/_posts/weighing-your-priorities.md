![Priorities by xkcd](/images/2010/09/priorities.png)

So as someone who has officially left the comfort zone of school (I don't consider grad school an umbrella to hide under anymore), one of the questions I'm hit the hardest with deals with whether or not I'm going to end up becoming a "Go junkie."

The deal is: I see Go as a pillar to understanding fundamental principles in life. It's true. Go may not be the most ideal way to sustain yourself, but the life lessons that a person can derive from it is worth far more in my opinion. That is not to say that Go will be the sole focus of my life however. I'm going to job hunt, focus on spending time with people important to me, and expand other job-related skills since I'm hoping to open a business someday. Go is just something I view as critical to self-growth, so it does rank high in my priorities; but I won't let it consume my life.

For all those who are striving to live in reality right now, weigh your priorities as well. I am one of the most enthusiastic players that would encourage people using go as a tool to learning life lessons and self-improvement. However, if it gets to the point that it is damaging other portions of your life, it may be time where you ask yourself whether or not you are falling into the folly of focusing on the local battle of the board.

Don't forget that the Go board is often reflective of your life. Focusing on go alone while letting the rest of your framework go to hell will only come to haunt you later on. No different from trying to control a single corner while letting your opponent consume the rest of the board.
