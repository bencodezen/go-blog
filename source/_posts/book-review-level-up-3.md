[expand title="Before I Read This Book..." trigclass="expandTitle"]

**My Abilities**

*   A mid to high SDK (single digit kyu) kyu who has read his fair share of go books and has a pretty strong foundation in the basics and teaching go.
**My Perspective**

*   Both [Level Up 1](http://www.bengozen.com/book-review-level-up-1/ "Book Review: Level Up 1") and [Level Up 2](http://www.bengozen.com/book-review-level-up-vol-2/ "Book Review: Level Up 2") had surpassed my expectations, so I was excited for what was store for me in this book!
[/expand]

[expand title="My Review" trigclass="expandTitle" expanded="true"]

**What did I enjoy about the book?**

*   The introduction to basic life and death shapes is very thorough.
*   The way they progress the reader from simple diagrams to more complicated diagrams still continues to amaze me. A job well done!
*   Though Level Up 2 spent a bit of time on ladders, they still have ladder problems to continue honing and refining the reader's ladder skills.
**What did I gain from reading this book?**

*   Polished my reading fundamentals.
*   Increased my speed at analyzing the status between two groups and determining which group to target if any.
*   Improved my ability to see basic connections and verify that they cannot be cut regardless of what the opponent tries.
**What style of teaching does the book use?**

*   Curriculum Style

    *   Content is organized into lessons, topics, or themes in order to facilitate learning.

*   Primary Learning Mechanism:

    *   Practice problems.

*   Other Learning Mechanisms:

    *   Simple explanations accompanied by equally simple diagrams.
    *   Fun comics to help explain concepts like life and death.
    *   Multiple choice and matching questions to reinforce what the reader is learning. For example, match the number of each move to the right term.
**What aspect can be improved on?**

*   I noticed that the answer book is sometimes incorrect or simply has the wrong diagram. This should be fixed since newer players could find it frustrating or end up learning the incorrect material.
**Is this book easy to read?**

*   Yes. It was very easy to understand all the explanations and progress through the book.

[expand title="Recommended For..." trigclass="expandTitle"]

*   Though the series is designed for kids, both kids and adults alike will be able to learn everything they need to know about playing go in a fun and entertaining way.
