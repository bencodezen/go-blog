The next morning we woke up and headed off to get breakfast at a popular bagel place called Brooklyn Bagels.

With our stomachs full of delicious bagel, we headed down to Brooklyn so that she could try Grimaldi’s.

We got there before they opened, so we went by the harbor to take some pictures.

After walking around a bit, it was time to get in line and eat our delicious pizza!

And with the weather so beautiful, we felt it would be a travesty to take the metro back, so we walked across the Brooklyn Bridge!

Before I knew it though, it was time for me to head back for my simul of the day against Francis Meyers, 1p. (At this point, I was trying to play as many different professionals as possible.) The following is the game record:

After my game finished, I went downstairs to help Myung and Dahye take more pictures of them while they were teaching another teacher seminar.

[caption id="attachment_5785" align="aligncenter" width="800"][![2014GC-D06-21](http://www.bengozen.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/2014GC-D06-21.jpg)](http://www.bengozen.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/2014GC-D06-21.jpg) This was one of the prizes they were giving out. As you can see, it's a Hikaru No Go set.[/caption]

[caption id="attachment_5790" align="aligncenter" width="800"]![2014GC-D06-42](http://www.bengozen.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/2014GC-D06-42.jpg) Check that out! Hikaru and Sai![/caption]

[caption id="attachment_5787" align="aligncenter" width="800"][![2014GC-D06-34](http://www.bengozen.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/2014GC-D06-34.jpg)](http://www.bengozen.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/2014GC-D06-34.jpg) These guys tied for a prize and so they duked it out via rock, paper, scissors.[/caption]

[caption id="attachment_5788" align="aligncenter" width="800"][![2014GC-D06-37](http://www.bengozen.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/2014GC-D06-37.jpg)](http://www.bengozen.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/2014GC-D06-37.jpg) Later on there was another prize to be fought over, so everyone joined in on a round robin tournament of rock, paper, scissors to see who would win![/caption]

[caption id="attachment_5789" align="aligncenter" width="800"][![2014GC-D06-38](http://www.bengozen.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/2014GC-D06-38.jpg)](http://www.bengozen.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/2014GC-D06-38.jpg) This was another one of the prizes: a board game where the primary objective was to move from one side of the board to the other using haengma rolled from a die.[/caption]

[caption id="attachment_5791" align="aligncenter" width="800"][![2014GC-D06-43](http://www.bengozen.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/2014GC-D06-43.jpg)](http://www.bengozen.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/2014GC-D06-43.jpg) And here's the entire class with their cool go pose![/caption]

When the class wrapped up, Myung had asked if I was available to eat dinner that night (which naturally I was). However, at the last minute he had to cancel because one of his student’s parents wanted to take him out to dinner. So I left to meet up with my girlfriend and try some great falafels and crepes!

[caption id="attachment_5792" align="aligncenter" width="800"][![2014GC-D06-44](http://www.bengozen.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/2014GC-D06-44.jpg)](http://www.bengozen.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/2014GC-D06-44.jpg) This was from a place called Taim. Pretty solid falafel sandwich![/caption]

[caption id="attachment_5793" align="aligncenter" width="800"][![2014GC-D06-46](http://www.bengozen.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/2014GC-D06-46.jpg)](http://www.bengozen.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/2014GC-D06-46.jpg) This was from a place called Eight Turn Crepe which sold crepes that were into an ice cream cone shape and filled with deliciousness.[/caption]

By the time I got back to Hotel Pennsylvania, Myung and Jungsang were giving a game commentary on one of the games played by Andy Liu 1p.

After taking a few pictures for them, I went to see where everyone was since I didn't see anyone in the audience. And guess where I found my friends Nate and Diego?

After watching the games for a bit, I walked out of the Master’s Tournament room, I turned to my right and who do I end up seeing?!

[caption id="attachment_5797" align="aligncenter" width="800"][![2014GC-D06-78](http://www.bengozen.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/2014GC-D06-78.jpg)](http://www.bengozen.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/2014GC-D06-78.jpg) The amazing Anders and kyu-killer Keith going over one of this games![/caption]

It was great to finally be able to meet Anders in person. I’m just sad I wasn’t able to hangout with him more! Oh well, at least I got the chance to meet the legendary Anders in person!
