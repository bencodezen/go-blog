So I visited the Greater Washington Go Club today.  Man... it was definitely a different experience playing with people in person.  I met a lot of great people, and my cousin and I learned a whole ton through their helpful comments and lessons.  We spent a lot of time playing out various positions based on the 3-3 point invasion on the 4-4 star, and that was super helpful.

In addition to having a couple games commented on, I also experienced my first full game between two dan level players.  That was awesome.  And it reminds me of how much work I have to do before I can even be considered an average player.  So it's time I get back to my studies.

Shout outs go out to Hal, Betsy, and Justin for helping out.  I'm sorry but I'm totally blanking out on three other names, but thanks for making the experience an awesome one.
