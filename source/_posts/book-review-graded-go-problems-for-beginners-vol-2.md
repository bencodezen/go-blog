### Detailed Review

#### Readability - 10 / 10

The diagrams begin to get a little bit more complicated in this volume. While this may seem slightly daunting at first, this is excellent exposure to how things will look when you're actually playing a game. In addition, the problems are still kept to a simplicity that will further ease the transition into bigger boards and more complicated positions.

For overall readability explanation, see the readability section in the [review on the entire series](http://www.bengozen.com/book-review-graded-go-problems-for-beginners-series/ "Book Review: Graded Go Problems for Beginners Series").

#### Content Quality - 10 / 10

While the cover states that the book is appropriate for 25 kyu to 20 kyu players, if you can do all the problems in these book, you are most likely going to be in the 12 to 15 kyu range.
