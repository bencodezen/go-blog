## Friday Go Forward: Week 51

## Overview

This week has been a little lax in terms of playing actual games, but I've been giving a lot of thought to my goals and have really started to slowly come to terms with matching my drive to get better at go with some of my other goals in life. So in other words, instead of the brilliant flash of energy and vigor that I used to put out (which was then followed by an equally tragic burnout), it feels as if the energy is brewing in a slower but much more sustainable way this time. Not sure how this translates into tasks and such yet, but only time will tell.

## Training Regimen

*   **Step #1:** Do 10 go problems a day. (Estimated time: 5-10 minutes)

    *   Note: I've been trying to do 10 problems a day from the _Graded Go Problems for Dan Players - Volume 1_, but I have to admit that it's been more of a skimming style where I try for a little bit and then look at the solution to see if my instincts were correct. This has not been terribly beneficial for my reading skills as a whole, and I have plans to approach this differently once I'm done with the book.
