[expand title="Synopsis" trigclass="expandTitle" expanded="true"]

1.  Really solid review of the content that was taught in the first five volumes of the Level Up Series.
2.  In place of explanations, there are a lot more problems and opening samples.
3.  If you want a review of the basics; but feel buying five introductory books is a little excessive, this is a nice all in one.

[expand title="Before I Read This Book..." trigclass="expandTitle"]

**My Abilities**

*   A mid to high SDK (single digit kyu) kyu who has read his fair share of go books and has a pretty strong foundation in the basics and teaching go.
**My Perspective**

*   Since I was able to complete the first five volumes without much difficulty, I was expecting this to be pretty easy.
[/expand]

[expand title="My Review" trigclass="expandTitle" expanded="true"]

**What did I enjoy about the book?**

*   Some review books are jokes in terms of comprehensive review, this is not one of them.
*   They spare no effort drilling concepts and making sure you remember what you learned over the last 5 books.
*   Even it is easy overall, a stronger player should not be overconfident in determining the answers. I almost made a few mistakes as a result of it.
**What did I gain from reading this book?**

*   Polished my fundamental life and death skills.
*   Improved my ability to read out capturing races.
*   Gained a better instinct when analyzing the board and what to play next.
**What style of teaching does the book use?**

*   Drill Sergeant

    *   Practice... practice... practice...

*   Primary Learning Mechanism:

    *   Practice problems

*   Other Learning Mechanisms:

    *   Samples of openings from professional games to further acclimate the reader to full games on a 19x19 board.
**What aspect(s) can be improved on?**

*   No complaints here. The book was extremely thorough and very accurate. Did not find any discrepancies in the answer book this time around.
**Is this book easy to read?**

*   Yes. Unless you can't read English, it doesn't get much simpler.

[expand title="Recommended For..." trigclass="expandTitle"]

*   Though the series is designed for kids, both kids and adults alike will be able to learn everything they need to know about playing go in a fun and entertaining way.
*   People who enjoy learning things in an easy to understand format and lots of opportunities to reinforce what they are learning.
