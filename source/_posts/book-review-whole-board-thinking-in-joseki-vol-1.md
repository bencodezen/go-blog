[expand title="Synopsis" trigclass="expandTitle" expanded="true"]

1.  Though it may seem like a book about joseki, I feel it's more of a book about understanding whole board thinking.
2.  Offers a great opportunity to practice whole board thinking while getting a better understanding of why one move is better or worse in different positions.
3.  Very easy to read and work through.

[expand title="Before I Read This Book..." trigclass="expandTitle"]

**My Abilities**

*   Although I've had some exposure to joseki, I have avoided studying them like the plague. I really, really don't like studying joseki.
**My Perspective**

*   Though I was skeptical of the book due to seeing the work joseki, I had heard a lot of good things about this book. In addition, since I was interested in trying to learn more about whole board thinking, I thought this book might be interesting to check out.

[expand title="My Review" trigclass="expandTitle" expanded="true"]

**What did I enjoy about the book?**

*   The problems use a multiple choice format to help players like me who don't know any joseki.
*   There are clear and easy to understand explanations for every answer choice that allows the reader to compare and contrast why the correct answer is better than the others.
*   The problems and solution diagrams are put on completely different pages to prevent the player from accidentally seeing the solution.
*   The layout of the book was very easy to read. Each section is clearly defined and the book is not cluttered at all.
*   Though the book seems to be centered on joseki, this seems more like a book on whole board thinking than anything else.
**What did I gain from reading this book?**

*   Improved understanding of how certain moves work with the board as a whole.
*   Reduction in kyu tunnel vision since I have more practice considering the whole board position.
*   Slightly better understanding of joseki patterns for the 3-4 point, low kakari.
**What style of teaching does the book use?**

*   Off the Cliff Style

    *   There is no gradual progression into the material.
    *   You learn through trial and error as you progress through the book.

*   Primary Learning Mechanism:

    *   Multiple choice practice problems.

*   Other Learning Mechanisms:

    *   Clear and concise explanations with an accompanying diagram to illustrate his point.
**What aspect can be improved on?**

*   I wish there were more problems! =D But in all seriousness, this book is amazing as it stands. Top notch!
**Is this book easy to read?**

*   Absolutely. The explanations are no longer than a paragraph long and are very clear and concise.

[38 Basic Joseki](http://www.bengozen.com/book-review-38-basic-joseki/ "Book Review: 38 Basic Joseki"), like most joseki books, actually focuses on teaching the reader about the various sequences from joseki. There is some mention of how they affect the board as a whole, but there is a lack of illustration as to how it is truly impacted. Whole Board Thinking in Joseki, on the other hand, does a perfect job filling this gap.
