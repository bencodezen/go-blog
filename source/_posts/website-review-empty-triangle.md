## Review

Please turn your attention to one of the most awesome Go related artwork that exists out there.  As you peruse through E3A, you'll find the characters humorous and absolutely relatable as you progress in Go.  The layout is simple and unique with the artistic nature of chidori.  Nothing much more needs to be said, so go check it out!

Some favorites...
