I decided to marathon a bunch of games against computers last night. It did not go well. Haha. And when I mean did not go well, I mean a string of resignations and embarrassing defeats of 60 points or more.

<!-- more -->

A couple factors went into my bad string of games last night:

1. My rank is undetermined at the moment on KGS, so computers are typically the best way to get a rank before playing other people.

2. Even though this might seem dumb, I felt like playing against a computer would make the games less personal which would hopefully ease the sting of defeat. And upon reflection, it did kind of help.

3. It was really late, so my thought was to just play fast game after fast game as a way to reacclimate myself to the game and stop focusing on winning and losing. By iterating quickly through games, I would hopefully regain some semblance of balance in my mindset towards playing.

And while I've written my fair share of posts against blitz games, I had such a fear of playing an imperfect game that I was not playing at all. And after talking with Nate, I have to say that I agree with his sentiments that playing a game of any sort is better than not playing at all. So even though blitz games against computers is certainly not something I want to get into the habit of, at least I am playing again.
