### My Thoughts as 5 Kyu

As someone who has studied the Chinese Opening rather extensively (at least from an amateur perspective), <span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Chinese Opening</span> by Yuan Zhou is a fantastic introduction to the fuseki.

When purchasing this book, the key thing to understand is that this is an _introductory_ book on the Chinese Opening. It's main purpose is to introduce big concepts regarding the Chinese Opening in order to give players a broad understanding of how they should approach it. In addition, Zhou does an excellent job  illustrating how the Chinese Opening can be used by various styles of play: attacking, territorial, etc.

Some of the areas it does not go extensively into include topics such as: how to respond when the opponent interrupts the Chinese Opening, different josekis and the reason for why one is better than another when considering the Chinese Opening, etc.

Now of course, there is the question as to whether someone should simply purchase [Kato's book](http://www.bengozen.com/book-review-the-chinese-opening-kato/ "Book Review: The Chinese Opening (Kato)") on the Chinese Opening instead.

To put it simply, if your goal is to devote yourself solely to the Chinese Opening so that you can master it and use it to your heart's content, then I would recommend going straight to [Kato's book](http://www.bengozen.com/book-review-the-chinese-opening-kato/ "Book Review: The Chinese Opening (Kato)"). On the other hand, if your goal is to simply gain a better understanding of the Chinese Opening so you can counter it more effectively or use it occasionally in your games, then Zhou's book is the one for you.
