## Introduction

For today's go meditation, I am happy to feature a new player to the reviews: RisingStar! At his request, I will be going through an even game that I played with him recently. Overall, RisingStar played very well and surprised me numerous times with his decisions to take critical points and to give me an easy win. In fact, I would have to say that there were a number of times where I was at a rather disadvantageous position and might have lost if he had just been a bit more aggressive. Nonetheless, a job well done to RisingStar and I hope that you enjoy this review! [

## **One Point Lesson**

Be careful not to get caught up in small plays that have little to no significance on the board. Otherwise, you will give your opponents a lot of opportunities to change the flow of the game.
