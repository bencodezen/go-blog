With the North American Go Convention over, I must admit that I miss the excitement of knowing I was going to be spending the evening or day immersed in go and hanging out with great company. Nonetheless, let us recap what's happened over the last five days:

1.  Attended two professional lectures.
2.  <span style="line-height: 13px;">Played 6 simultaneous games with professionals.</span>
3.  Managed to actually win one of my simul games.
Below is a close-up of all the autographs on the fan and the related games that I played.

Although it would have been great to play in the tournament, I felt that my time was spent really well on pro events. Tempering myself for battle is something I can do on my own, while attending pro events of this quantity is a whole different matter. I really do think that the time I spent at the NAGC has really helped to get me out of my rut and bring newfound motivation towards go.

Overall, it was a fantastic experience that I would not have traded for the world. Not only did I learn so much and acquire a renewed motivation towards of go; but most importantly, I made some great friends and had a really fun time.

I hope that you've enjoyed this series and hope to see you at a convention some day!
