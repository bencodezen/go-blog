So this weekend has been pretty good so far. I've been trying to study Go as often as possible. I've diverted my attention slightly to two more theory books: <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Lessons in the Fundamentals of Go</span> along with <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Basic Techniques of Go</span>. No worries though, I'm still doing lots of problems!

I also visited the Congress of Gamers in Rockville yesterday. John and Todd both had a table for Go. Two new players showed up in the time I was there (for approximately an hour or so). So I'm glad we managed to attract some attention. I also got to play a game against Todd who is roughly 4 kyu? We played a 9 stone handicap game and I managed to win by 8.5 points with 0.5 komi. And apparently I could have killed a group that I thought was already alive, so I could have won by more.

Time to get back to work. The fruits of my training may have begun to yield, but the journey is far from over.
