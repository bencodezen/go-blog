# <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff6600; text-decoration: underline;">HAPPY HALLOWEEN!!!!Â </span></span>

As I promised last week, today is the grand opening of the new redesign for BenGoZen! It's time to change your bookmarks, because BenGoZen now has its own domain name and is hosted on a completely new platform!

## [www.bengozen.com](http://www.bengozen.com)

For those who haven't visited in a while, here are some of the new features that will be accessible to you on the new design!

*   Easy Email &amp; RSS Subscription!
*   Embedded Eidogo Kifu so you can view the game right in the post!
*   Updated content layout for easier reading experience and better searching!
*   Translator tool in case you want to read my blog in another language!
*   Easy contact form so you can send me emails at any time!

And in case there is any confusion, there will no longer be any updates here on the Blogger platform. All comments have also been disabled to prevent any confusion as well, so make sure to come on over to the new [site](http://www.bengozen.com)! I assure you that it is worth it.

With that in mind, hope to see you over at the new [site](http://www.bengozen.com)!

_Also, for those of us that are being bombarded by Hurricane Sandy, I hope you are doing alright and have the good fortune of having electricity and internet so that you can be reading this. Take care!_
