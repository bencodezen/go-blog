summary:
	<p>For today's go meditation, you will witness an even game that I played recently against a 5k opponent. Overall I felt that I handled it quite well, but I will note that I got lucky during a ko fight in the M11 area. You'll see what I mean. And though it wasn't intentional, the game ended up looking like a yin-yang when we were finished. Kind of amusing. xD</p>

## One Point Lesson

When your opponent is desperately trying to live in your sphere of influence, just watch your connections and the overplays will fall to the wayside.
