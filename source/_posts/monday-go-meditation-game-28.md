## Introduction

For today's go meditation, I am featuring an opponent who was rather unique. Before he accepted my challenge, the first thing he asked was, "Do you play fast?" And the reason this is significant is because it launches us into a discussion during the game about kyu players' tendency to make automatic responses. And after some back and forth, I suddenly felt very compelled to not make any automatic responses. So in a number of ways, I definitely have to thank my opponent for forcing me to raise the level of my game by slowing down. In addition, though I was a bit saddened by the fact that I lost after having a commanding position, I definitely learned a lot from it and have no regrets.[

## **One Point Lesson**

**No matter how obvious the next move is, take a moment to think about a move instead of automatically responding. **
