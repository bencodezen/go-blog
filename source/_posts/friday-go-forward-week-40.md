## Friday Go Forward: Week 40

## Overview

Quite a bit has happened over the past week. First off, my training menu is completely thrown off now. Due to other pursuits in my life (i.e., design, boxing, etc.), it seems I lost track of time and could not be consistent about my study. In addition, I am also pretty swamped with trying to get my reviews for my GoGameGuru items up and online asap. So I've definitely lost a little bit momentum this week, but hopefully I'll be able to regain my footing soon and resume my research into the ideal training menu. Anyhow, lots of work to do. See you next week!
