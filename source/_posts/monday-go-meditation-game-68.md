## Introduction

For this week’s meditation, we are going to be reviewing my first professional simul game from [Go Congress](http://www.bengozen.com/go-congress-2014-day-1/ "Go Congress 2014 — Day 1")! Through this game, you’ll get to witness the enduring strength of professionals in simul games. Even though the game looks overwhelmingly in Black’s advantage for a good portion of the game, it is in the middle game where their precise analysis becomes extremely evident.

In case there are those wondering though, Dahye’s felt that I played well for most of the game; but as you’ll see in the game, an oversight on the security of my own groups was the ultimate reason for my demise. Hope that you enjoy the game!
