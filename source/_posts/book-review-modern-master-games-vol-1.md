[expand title="Synopsis" trigclass="expandTitle" expanded="true"]

1.  A fascinating journey that takes you through the beginnings of tournament go in Japan.
2.  Every game is accompanied by a backstory and even insight from the players themselves!
3.  The game commentary seems to be aimed at players who are mid to high SDKs (single digit kyus) and above.
[/expand]

[expand title="Before I Read This Book..." trigclass="expandTitle"]

**My Abilities**

*   As a mid to high SDK (single digit kyu), I have had a fair bit of exposure to dan level thinking when having my games reviewed or playing teaching games. In addition, I have attended professional lectures on pro games where I was able to actually understand some of it.
**My Perspective**

*   I have tried numerous times to work through collections of professional games before and failed miserably. It has been awhile since I've tried to study professional games again, but I'm looking forward to what this book has in store for me.

[expand title="My Review" trigclass="expandTitle" expanded="true"]

**What did I enjoy about the book?**

*   Though it is a collection of professional games, the way that the book is structured makes it seem like you are being taken on a personal tour through some of the most important historical games in go history.
*   The games are not simply game commentaries where the value of one move versus another is being discussed, but instead there is a lot of history and insight from the players themselves that really help personify and bring the reviews to life.
*   To reiterate the previous point, the insight into the significance behind X move because of psychological warfare between the two players really made me stop to appreciate the emotional significance of a move. Whereas if I were just simply replaying the kifu, I would have not given that move a second thought.
**What did I gain from reading this book?**

*   Valuable insight into the incredible fighting spirit and genius that top professional players have in their games.
*   I am much more comfortable studying professional games than I was before I started reading the book.
*   A real appreciation for the famous players that I had heard of so often (i.e. Sakata Eio) since you get an opportunity to learn about them through the historical significance of the games along with the story prior to each game.
**What style of teaching does the book use?**

*   Historical Textbook + Game Commentaries Hybrid

		*   Prior to every game, the history and background describing the significance of the game is laid out to set the stage for the game commentary.
		*   Amidst the normal game commentary, you will also find insights and comments from the players themselves and spectators here and there as well.
**What aspect can be improved on?**

*   I would have liked to see more explanations regarding the purpose behind certain moves instead of variations at times; but this should be taken with a grain of salt since I am a weak player and the book has already done a great job not overloading the reader with too many complicated variations.
**Is this book easy to read?**

*   Yes. Each game is only around 10-15 pages long and the explanations are kept short and simple.
