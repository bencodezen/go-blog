## Introduction

For today's go meditation, I am happy to feature fellow go player and friend moboy78! We've talked about playing a longer game with one another for quite some time, and I'm glad we finally did! He was technically supposed to give me a 4 stone handicap at the time (since my rank had dropped to 6k). Hehe. xD However, though I don't ever like tooting my own horn, even I had to admit that my rank on KGS is pretty bogus for the most part. So we agreed to play an even game and played a really fun game that you will find below. Hope you enjoy![

## **One Point Lesson**

** Be very careful before using loose connections and faster moves when jumping into your opponent's influence.**
