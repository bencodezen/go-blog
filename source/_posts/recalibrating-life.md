Hey everyone. Sorry that I have been a little MIA over the past week. I was out of town for a little over a week and have just been incredibly swamped. Haha. I was ready for being kind of busy, but nothing like what the trip held for me. As a result, everything got thrown out of sync and content is on break this week until I can recalibrate my brain and get back on track. Hope all is well with everyone!
