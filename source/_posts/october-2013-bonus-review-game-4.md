For this week's bonus review, we come to the final conclusion of my Canada Go League performance! After my performance from the third game, my goal was to be much calmer during this game and avoid any big blunders like before. Do I manage to end with a 3-1 record? Or will I be put in my place again and be left with a 2-2 record? Jump into the kifu and find out!
