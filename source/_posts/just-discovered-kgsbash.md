I've been feeling rather off the last couple of days. Not sick or anything, but just feeling a little out of it. Haven't really felt like studying, but it's been fun playing a casual game here and there. But on a more important note, I just discovered a site called [KGSBash](http://kgsbash.org). And if you're wondering what it's about, here are some that had me laughing...

_adoreme: it is said that kgs has a secret end stage_
_adoreme: get 9dan_
_adoreme: and beat 50 9dans in a row_
_adoreme: then tartrate will appear as the endboss_

_RayFrost [2k]: I played a 3p today... with 9 handicap_
_RayFrost [2k]: I lost._
_RayFrost [2k]: 3p is strong. :|_
_LazyDragon [3k]: i once played a 5p with 9hc - also lost ..._
_tellone [2k]: i once played a very drunk 2p who forgot which collor he had_
_tellone [2k]: and i still lost_

Oh KGS... Good times...
