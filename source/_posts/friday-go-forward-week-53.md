## Friday Go Forward: Week 53

## Overview

As the weeks have gone on, it's been great to feel a sustainable change happening in regards to my discipline towards blogging along with go itself. In case any of you missed it, [Go Congress](http://www.bengozen.com/u-s-go-congress-ny/ "U.S. Go Congress in NY!") is coming up soon! So in light of that, I am really aiming to step up my training in preparation for it. My goal is to become a solid dan player before Go Congress. Might be impossible, but I'll never know till I try. So with that said, here's to the start of overcoming the monumental hurdle all kyu players are aiming for: climbing over the dan wall and never falling back (aka not jumping between 1k and 1d). Ikuzo!

## Training Regimen

*   **Step #1:** Do 10 go problems a day. (Estimated time: 5-10 minutes)

*   [OGS](http://online-go.com/user/view/549/BenGoZen "Online Go Server - BenGoZen") -  7 ongoing games | 4 completed games

## Books

*   Finished on _Graded Go Problems for Dan Players - Volume One: 300 Life-and-Death Problems_.
