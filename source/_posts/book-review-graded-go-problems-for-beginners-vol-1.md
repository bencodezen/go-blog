### Detailed Review

#### Readability - 10 / 10

One of my favorite aspects about this book is the fact that the diagrams are so large (in comparison to typical [tsumego](http://senseis.xmp.net/?Tsumego) you might find). The use of smaller boards (e.g., 13x13) and bigger pieces makes the problems very inviting and less intimidating.

For overall readability explanation, see the readability section in the [review on the entire series](http://www.bengozen.com/book-review-graded-go-problems-for-beginners-series/ "Book Review: Graded Go Problems for Beginners Series").

#### Content Quality - 10 / 10

The problems in this volume are a remarkable collection of fundamental concepts that every go player should know (regardless of your approach to the game).

While the cover states that the book is appropriate for 30 kyu to 25 kyu players, if you can do all the problems in these book, you are most likely going to be in the 20 kyu range.
