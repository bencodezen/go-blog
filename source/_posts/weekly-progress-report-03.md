## Overview

Three weeks and counting! I am feeling like I am starting to make some real progress as I continue to adhere to my training regimen. Though I thought about upping my problem solving regimen, I think it’s at a good place where I am making decent progress while the task is relatively easy to accomplish. And as you’ll notice, I also added a playing regimen as well which is very easily supported via the GoQuest app I talked about in my [journal entry earlier this week](http://www.bengozen.com/journey-entry-04/ "Journey Entry: #04").

Aside from training, I’ve also been working on Monday Go Meditation and will be bringing back book reviews into the picture. Similar to how I’m approaching my training, I’m hoping to build a system that allows for consistency in book reviews as opposed to a huge surge of them and then nothing for a while. Though this might seem stupid to some, I really am aiming to one day craft the perfect book review for go books that can serve as the model for people in the future.

That’s enough dreaming for now though. Haha. For now, I’ll focus on putting one foot in front of another. Forward I go!
