### Synopsis

1.  A very thorough review of the last five volumes of Level Up.

2.  The game samples are starting to be rather complicated.

3.  Continues to live up to the quality of problems and content you come to expect of the series.

### Before I Read This Book...

**My Abilities**

*   A mid to high SDK (single digit kyu) kyu who has read his fair share of go books and has a pretty strong foundation in the basics and teaching go.

**My Perspective**

*   Towards the end of the series, I noticed that I am actually starting to make mistakes here and there. So I'm going to try and take this a little slower in hopes of not making any mistakes.

### My Review

**What did I enjoy about the book?**

*   Spends quite a bit of time talking about go etiquette and one's mindset/attitude when playing go.
*   Extremely thoroughly reviews the material you learned from Level Up 5 - 10.
*   The Next Moves problems also took a step up in difficult and complication. In fact, there were quite a few times where I was a little lost as to which was the correct answer.

**What did I gain from reading this book?**

*   Further realization of how, even at the what they consider DDK level, there are still holes in my reading abilities.
*   Reinforced understanding of the josekis that they have taught thus far.
*   Polished reading ability and improved analysis speed.

**What style of teaching does the book use?**

*   Curriculum Style

		*   Content is organized into lessons, topics, or themes in order to facilitate learning.

*   Primary Learning Mechanism:

		*   Practice problems

*   Other Learning Mechanisms:

		*   Cute and entertaining comics to teach and/or reinforce lessons.
		*   Simple explantations that are accompanied by equally simple diagrams.
		*   Samples of openings from professional games to further acclimate the reader to full games on a 19x19 board.

**What aspect can be improved on?**

*   Page 55 #10 Solution is incorrect.
*   I enjoy the Next Move problems, but the lack of explanations for why certain moves are the correct answer leaves me a little unsettled. Don't forget that this considers the fact that I have more knowledge than someone learning these things for the first time. So explanations for why a certain move (e.g., capping move) is correct would be very helpful.
*   The calculating endgame move value problems were actually rather difficult. I don't feel like the previous volumes prepared me enough for these questions.

**Is this book easy to read?**

*   Yes. Other than the occasional article, the explanations are very easy short and easy to understand.

### Recommended For...

*   Though the series is designed for kids, both kids and adults alike will be able to learn everything they need to know about playing go in a fun and entertaining way.
*   People who enjoy learning things in an easy to understand format and lots of opportunities to reinforce what they are learning.
