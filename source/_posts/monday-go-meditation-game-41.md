## Introduction

For this week's meditation, prepare for an epic battle where I try to kill my opponent's group time after time again. Not only do I manage to fail once, but I fail a second time. However, while that sounds negative, was it necessarily a bad thing? Prepare yourself for a journey that will show you why a group that barely lives is hardly a reason to resign. Hope you enjoy![

## **One Point Lesson**

A group that barely makes it out alive is only worth a few points. Do not despair and resign because you failed to kill the group.
