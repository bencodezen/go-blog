summary: For this week's meditation, we are going to start off nice and easy with a 9x9 game I played on GoQuest a week or so ago. It's not too crazy in regards to fighting, but is a great example of how powerful influence can be on such a small board. Hope that you enjoy the game and the commentary!

## One Point Lesson

Never hesitate to take influence early on when playing on a small board, it is more powerful than you probably realize.
