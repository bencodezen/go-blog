### Before I Read This Book...

**My Abilities**

*   When it came to moyo (i.e. frameworks), I had one of two weapons in my arsenal: (1) Build the biggest framework possible and hopefully kill anything that comes inside. (2) Always invade my opponent's framework and try to live. In the rare occasion that I thought to reduce the framework, the timing was usually off.

**My Perspective**

*   By reading this book, I was hoping to gain a more balanced perspective on how to deal with and build moyos. Though I did not have a chance to preview the book, I was also hoping the teaching format would be a combination of explanations along with practice problems.

### My Review

**What did I enjoy about the book?**

*   I really liked how they broke down attacking and defending moyos into 13 basic principles. Although it may be some time before they stick in my brain, I felt that the one line "proverbs" were very helpful.
*   The practice problems they provided were a great test of the principles that they introduced in the beginning of the book.
*   The explanations were very clear and usually provided an incorrect variation with an explanation of why it contradicted the 13 basic principles.

**What did I gain from reading this book?**

*   A better understanding of how to attack and defend moyos.
*   Greater confidence in dealing with my opponent's moyos.
*   Inadvertently ended up getting a better understanding of whole board thinking since I have an improved ability to see moyos forming before it is way too late.

**What style of teaching does the book use?**

*   Multi-Pronged Approach

		*   There are equal parts explanations, practice problems, along with game commentaries.

*   Learning Mechanisms

		*   Explanations with example diagrams
		*   Professional games with commentary
		*   Practice problems

**What aspect can be improved on?**

*   I am happy to say that this book is great as it stands!

**Is this book easy to read?**

*   Yes. The explanations are explained using laymen terms and are pretty short and straightforward.

### Recommended For...

*   Players looking for an introduction to dealing with moyos.
*   Players looking to reinforce their understanding of dealing with moyos.
