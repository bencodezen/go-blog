There's one thing I've learned recently is that leagues are a fantastic place for experimental games. Not convinced? Three reasons:

1.  <span style="line-height: 13px;">They are free games. You have nothing to lose.</span>
2.  More often than not, you are playing people stronger than you. If you're going to lose anyways, why not do so while learning something new?
3.  The reviews of your games will yield more nuggets of wisdom than normal since you are trying to break into new territory.
My record thus far has been pretty abysmal, but like the title of this post suggests, I feel like I've been going out with a bang each time. Don't get me wrong, the losing aspect still stings a little bit; but I am comforted by the idea that the games are not terribly lopsided as a whole.

Here's to hoping I can hang on to my place in the Beta class... *fingers crossed*
