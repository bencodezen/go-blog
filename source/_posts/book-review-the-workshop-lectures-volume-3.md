### Before I Read This Book...

**My Abilities**

*   A mid-high SDK (single digit kyu) who has read his fair share of books and has a decent foundation of most areas in go.

**My Perspective**

*   Since these are written to be more of a "workshop" format, I was looking forward to a new style of writing along with a refreshing perspective on some common questions that most players might have.

### Synopsis

**What did I enjoy about the book?**

*   As usual, Yang continues to breakdown topics into simple explanations that I could easily understand.
*   The topics are extremely relevant to the average player since a majority of go literature assumes that the reader is already familiar and well versed in these basic concepts.
*   Yang usually has a checklist of questions for each section to remind the reader of the important things to remember.

**What did I gain from reading this book?**

*   A much better understanding of how to evaluate whether a group is weak or not.
*   Better grasp on what forcing moves are. Though applying it is still rather hazy for me.

**What style of teaching does the book use?**

*   Workshop Format

		*   Topics of broken down into its simplest format and represents more of an outline than a thorough textbook.

*   Primary Learning Mechanism:

		*   Explanations with accompanying diagrams

*   Other Learning Mechanisms:

		*   Practice problems

**What aspect can be improved on?**

*   Though the examples can be helpful, I found that they slightly overwhelming after some time since I am still having issues actually understanding the concept solidly. A good example of this is whether or not a forcing move is good or bad. I have a general idea, but that's all. So before I get into the weeds of how to use it, it would have been better to have more basic practice questions.

**Is this book easy to read?**

*   Yes. The explanations are concise and the accompanying diagrams are often no more than a few moves long.

**Bottom Line**

1.  Breaks down topics into really easy to understand explanations.
2.  Has a lot of valuable content for such a short book!
3.  Worth every penny you spend on it!

### My Review

In this volume, I found that the sections on the opening were a little harder to grasp. This is probably due to the fact that the nature of the opening is rather vast and thus trying to condense it down into a few pages is rather difficult. The forcing move section was also a little bit tough for me to really grab hold of as well. I imagine this is due to the fact that the whole concept of "timing" in go is not so easily summed up in a few pages. On the other hand though, I was very impressed by the sections regarding weak groups. And in my opinion, those two sections make the entire book worth purchasing.

### Recommended For...

*   Players who are 10 kyu or stronger.
*   Players who want guidelines on how to handle the topics covered in the book.
