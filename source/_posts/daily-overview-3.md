So here ends my Monday.  Overall, there was a lot of progression in terms of how I saw the game and what I know I need to do now.  I just played a free game with a weaker player who, for some reason, only wanted a two stone handicap.  It was definitely different to see such a difference in reading ability.  I mean I know he (or she) is only a 23k and I'm a 15k, but still... it wasn't till I was playing him that I was like... Oh... that's how stupid I must look to all the stronger players I've been playing.

Overall.. here are my ratings for the day.

1.  Problems - Minimal
2.  Theory - Minimal
3.  Games - Satisfactory
<div>Hopefully I'll be able to at least to satisfactory on all three on a more consistent basis.</div>
