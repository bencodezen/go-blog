For those who have not heard the news, there is talk of the possibility of Lee Sedol coming to the United States (Source: [GoGameGuru](http://gogameguru.com/lee-sedol-retirement-move-overseas/)). For those who are not aware of who [Lee Sedol](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_Sedol) is, he is one of the top professional players right now. While many of us in the Western hemisphere could only dream about the possibility of even seeing one of his games live in person, the mere thought that I could possibly meet him in person and (in the ultimate of possibilities) actually get lessons from him is just....

Although even if that ends up becoming true, it won't happen for at least another three to four years. So, guess I have a bit of work to do until then huh? After all, I wouldn't want him spending time trying to teach me obvious mistakes that I myself notice.

With that potential awesomeness aside, my losing streak continues to thrive as I wrap up my final ASR games. Just one more left to go. After that, it's time to do a serious assessment of my training regimen.
