## Introduction

For this week's meditation, I will start by prefacing the fact that before I started playing this game, I noticed my opponent was German. Based on my experience thus far, there are three groups of players that have been consistently aggressive and challenged my reading abilities constantly: Russians, Koreans, and Germans. This is by no means a bad thing, but it certainly made me a tad nervous. And just as I guessed, I ended up with another bloody game on my hands. It's starting to make me think there is a trend in my games... Enjoy!

## **One Point Lesson**

Always choose profit over the very difficult task of killing a group. Then if your opponent decides to neglect his group and the conditions are ripe, then it's time to pounce.
