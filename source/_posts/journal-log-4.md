So I'm back online!  With two online games under my belt today, I'm feeling pretty good.

1.  I played against a human AkiraWeiqi (22 kyu).  It was a good battle.  We both made some careless errors, but man it is different playing against a handicap.  I'm so used to taking handicaps/even games that seeing stones on the board was like WHOA!  I won by a slight margin, but I'll have to have someone review it to see if he might have been able to close the gap.

2.  Second game was against the LiberyBot (14 kyu), and that I thought I played relatively well.  I lost by 5.5 moku, but I think it was largely due to a huge reading error in one of my larger groups which then resulted in its death.  Sigh.... need more practice.
Okay.  So... in terms of my study regimen.... here's what we'll be looking at.

*   Life and Death Problem
*   Reading about Go Strategy
*   General Go Problems
*   Play one serious game
*   Replay at least part of a pro game

Let's see where that takes me.  Onwards!
