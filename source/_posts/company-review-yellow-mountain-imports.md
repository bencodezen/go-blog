## Review:

Yellow Mountain Imports has the most well designed website that I've seen to date.  It's images do not take too long to load and show the absolute aesthetics of each of the games they sell.  Everything is designed so well that it doesn't take a computer whiz to navigate.

One of the great aspects about YMImports is the fact that they have "Game FAQs."  Essentially, any commons questions that may arise about purchasing some of the different games are already answered.  In addition, any questions regarding how to play a number of games is also included!

If you are wondering what makes YMImports one of my favorite places to purchase things, it's the fact that they have free shipping on orders over $125.  Now now... I know that it may seem like a lot of money for some players out there, which is why it's so awesome that THEY ALSO SELL ON AMAZON!  A number of the things that you'd like to get (e.g. Deluxe Go Roll Up Magnetic Portable Set) can go for free shipping on Amazon at a lower cost to you.  

Also, in case you are wondering, the shipping for regular items is about normal.  Not too pricey since they tend to be shipping heavier items (e.g. boards or stones) and include a tracking number and usually ship within a week.  

The best aspect of YMImports is their customer service.  In the few times I've had issues or questions, I've always had a response within 12 hours.  Like I mentioned in my review of the Shin-Kaya - 1-1/2" (4cm) Go Floor Board with Yunzi Stones and Bowls, I had missing stone pieces and they were quick to respond and ship out the replacements.

The only critique (if it can even be called that) I have about YMImports is the fact that a majority of their books tend to be written in other languages (e.g. Korean and Chinese).  But that's honestly a small thing compared to all the positive aspects they have.

## Conclusion:

YMImports is one of the best places to get your typical Go equipment.  If you are looking for higher end stuff, you'll have to wait for me to get a well paying job before I can review that aspect.  But other than that, this is the place to go for great and reliable equipment that won't cost you an arm and a leg.
