## Friday Go Forward: Week 50

## Overview

It's been great getting to slowly have go pick up in my life again. Starting with the [go workshop](http://www.bengozen.com/chinese-new-year-2014-mall-go-demo/ "Chinese New Year 2014 Mall Go Demo") I volunteered at the mall last weekend, it's been a little tumultuous since I'm dealing with [old habits](http://www.bengozen.com/caught-bloodlust/ "Caught In Bloodlust Again…") that have plagued me for quite some time; however, I'm glad to be back into it and trying to work through it. Just taking it one move at a time...
