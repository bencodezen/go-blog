## Thoughts

It's been a rather light week in terms of playing and studying, but hopefully the Study Group Kyu website will be up and running soon! In addition, starting tomorrow I will be releasing updates and revisions on previous equipment reviews and integrating new reviews as time goes on! So it was still a productive go week even though I didn't get to play as much as I would've liked. Here's to hoping my schedule will stabilize next week so I can play more ranked games!
