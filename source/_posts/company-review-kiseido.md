If you order straight from the publisher [Kiseido](http://kiseido.com/go_books.htm), you'll find that the price for a lot of books (that aren't available on Amazon) are SIGNIFICANTLY cheaper for a BRAND NEW copy.  For all those who are skeptical about ordering from [Kiseido](http://kiseido.com/go_books.htm), I went ahead and ordered the first two volumes to test it out.  Here are my observations:

1.  The ordering and payment process does seem kind of sketchy.
2.  The e-mail confirmation looks terrible (like one giant text blob).

3.  There was no tracking number that was given.
4.  Shipping was $3.50 for me.

Was I worried?  Absolutely.  Except I had to find out how reliable this would be, and here are my findings:

1.  Ordered on August 12th, and it came in the mail on August 21st!  It may be a little over a week, but it was fast to me considering the fact that it was coming all the way from Japan and shipping was only $3.50.
2.  Books were protected well and were in great condition when they arrived.
3.  Verdict: Although I had my skepticism and it didn't have a tracking number, 100% TOTALLY WORTH IT.
