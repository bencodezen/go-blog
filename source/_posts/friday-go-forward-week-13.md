## Thoughts

I'm still trying to figure out a way out of my funk, but I spent this week trying to reinvigorate my studies and gain some perspective on the game. As you can see, one of the new elements I added to my studies is starting to study professional games. As a friend mentioned to me, this is usually difficult for most players (even at the high dan level). I'm not sure how beneficial it will be, but we'll see how it goes. If anyone ever wants to discuss the pro game I'm studying with me, let me know and we can meet up online to talk about it. Till next week!
