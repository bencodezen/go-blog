So today marks my two month milestone. Let's overview my original goal shall we?

#1\. Finish the following books:

#2\. Replay 25 moves of a professional game (that has commentary) everyday.

#3\. Play one serious game (not a bot) everyday where I don't rush and try my hardest.

A lot has changed since I originally set those goals. Here's what I have accomplished.

#1\. Finished the following books:

I did not manage to refocus myself onto problems in time for it to be worth mentioning at this point. For those whose eyes may be slightly wide open at the number of books, again I must reiterate that I have simply READ them once. Comprehension and integration are still far, far away.

There's a scene in <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Hikaru no Go</span>, which I can't seem to find, where Sai comments on how everything that Hikaru had been observing and replaying up to that point began to crystallize in him. I'm hoping to have a similar effect by achieving a broad range of theory first instead of just memorizing everything by rote. The second month goal may have failed, but like the stones we place on the board, let us simply move forward.
