[expand title="Before I Read This Book..." trigclass="expandTitle"]

When I first started learning about modern day go professionals, it's to no one's surprise that one of the first names I came upon was Lee Changho. Not only was he extremely famous, but it seemed he was undisputedly #1 at the time (although he might have started dropping ranks by the time I learned about him). So it goes without saying that I was curious what made him so strong, and thus it led me to purchasing this book.

[expand title="My Review" trigclass="expandTitle" expanded="true"]

Similar to Master Style of Play: Go Seigen, you are initially greeted with a fun little dialogue between Yuan Zhou and two amateur players to give an introduction on Lee Changho and his background. After a couple of pages of this, Zhou then dives right into the game reviews.

One of the things that I enjoyed about the game diagrams in this book is that they are often only a couple moves long. This makes it a lot easier to follow what is going on and allows weaker players to have a chance to understand what is going on. In addition, the variations are kept to a minimum in order to keep a focus on Lee Changho's style instead of go theory and technique.

Upon finishing both game commentaries, I am glad that I finally took the time to gain insight into Lee Changho's style. It's quite simple and straightforward when compared to Go Seigen, but it is one of the more appropriate styles that I feel kyu players should check out first. This is because Lee Changho's games convey the prime example of how one does not have to risk battles of epic proportions to win games, which is something I think many kyu players never take the time to learn or realize.

At the end of the day, this is a book that is best suited for those looking to get a glimpse into Lee Changho's style and what it means to play calm go. Definitely recommended for kyu players.
