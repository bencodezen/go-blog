summary: >
	<p>This week's game is a great example of how to play against an opponent who is extremely aggressive and overplays on a consistent basis. Throughout the game, you'll see my opponent try to fight for what he thinks is important; and how I respond in kind in pursuit of bigger territory or more important areas. In addition, you get to watch me hunt him down when he invades my moyo. Hope you enjoy!</p>
