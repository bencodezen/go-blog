[![2014-12-10 Go Seigen](http://www.bengozen.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/2014-12-10-Go-Seigen-300x225.jpg)](http://www.bengozen.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/2014-12-10-Go-Seigen.jpg)

As many of you are aware, the legendary Go Seigen passed away on November 30th. I’ve been wracking my brain for a way to properly honor him, but it is still eluding me. To help the process out, I decided that it would be a good start working through my collection of his games again. As I played through his game (above), I started to feel the embers begin to catch flame again.

I also had the opportunity to play with fellow blogger RisingStar today. It was a friendly game with a 9 stone handicap. And while the mere thought of playing that kind of game would have scared me a week ago, it was surprisingly calming and fun. Sometimes I feel like I get in these moves where the game just seems to make sense. Moves flow easily and there is a serenity that keeps you level headed at all times. This was one of those games.

The game record is below, but there will most likely be a MGM on it in the future.
