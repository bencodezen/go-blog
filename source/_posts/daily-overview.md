So for those keeping track, I'm sorry that I skipped over a Daily Overview. Ever since that game of infinite cutting points and unprecedented misreads, I haven't played a game since. Now this doesn't mean that I'm like taking a sabbatical from the game or anything. I guess I want to see where my one-week training will take me. I'll be returning to KGS next Wednesday.

In terms of what I've been doing since then, I've mostly been focusing on problem. A little bit of theory here and there, but we'll see where the training goes. This will be the last overview until next week. Until then, I'll be posting up more content on for the blog. See you all in a week!
