I'm back and excited to be back.  So I played my first game on KGS this morning.  I have to say it's quite an ugly game. I despise a number of my moves and misreads. So just keep that in mind when you look at it. In terms of why I'm posting it, it's to just serve as a reminder to myself and others how different application of principles in your play is different than practicing.  One thing is for sure though, I did not let myself lose my composure when I made those mistakes. And since that was one of my main goals, I'm glad I could play well enough to come out with a half point komi win.  =D
