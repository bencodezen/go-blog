	<p>For today's go meditation, I am featuring a momentous moment in my go career: <em>making a dan opponent resign in an even game</em>. Now to clear up some things, it is important to remember that Tygem 3 dans are not equivalent of KGS 3 dans. So before everyone starts tossing sandbagger comments, let's also remember that this is just one game of many. I have lost more games to 3 dan players on Tygem than I have won. Nonetheless, I still feel like this game record was worth mentioning since it was an important milestone to me. Enjoy</p>
