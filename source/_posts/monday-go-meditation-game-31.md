## Introduction

For today's go meditation, I am featuring a momentous moment in my go career: _Making a dan opponent resign in an even game_. Now to clear up some things, it is important to remember that Tygem 3 dans are not equivalent of KGS 3 dans. So before everyone starts tossing sandbagger comments, let's also remember that this is just one game of many. I have lost more games to 3 dan players on Tygem than I have won. Nonetheless, I still feel like this game record was worth mentioning since it was an important milestone to me. Enjoy![

## **One Point Lesson**

It doesn't matter if your opponent is 6 stones stronger than you, play your best go. You might rise to the occasion and pull off a crazy win.
