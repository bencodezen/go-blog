## Friday Go Forward: Week 41

## Overview

_Note: It seems my life will forever be consistently crazy and busy, so instead of talking about all the time I don't have, I will be approaching these overviews from more of a goal and progress type theme for now until I can come up with something better._

This week's goal was to really started chipping away at the pile of equipment reviews that I need to do. I'm happy to report that I've finished two ([Go Bento Box](http://www.bengozen.com/equipment-review-go-bento-box/ "Equipment Review: The Go Bento Box") and [Folding Go Board](http://www.bengozen.com/equipment-review-folding-go-board/ "Equipment Review: Folding Go Board")), but there are still quite a few to go and so that work will definitely resume into next week. In regards to my progress of studying however, though that as taken a back seat for a little while, I was able to fit in a couple lessons with my sensei frozensoul. There are quite a few things he remarked on that have got me thinking, but more on that when I have processed it a bit better.

For next week, I'm hoping to wrap up on all of my equipment reviews so that I can can resume work on my book reviews. In addition, I will be going on a mini-go retreat at a friend's house this weekend, so I will also be looking to put out a detailed post recounting the games and good times that is sure to come. So be on the lookout for those! See you next week!
