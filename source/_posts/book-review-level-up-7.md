[expand title="Before I Read This Book..." trigclass="expandTitle"]

**My Abilities**

*   A mid to high SDK (single digit kyu) kyu who has read his fair share of go books and has a pretty strong foundation in the basics and teaching go.
**My Perspective**

*   Level Up 6 started to make my brain work (especially with the endgame), so I am planning on being a little more careful with this next one.
[/expand]

[expand title="My Review" trigclass="expandTitle" expanded="true"]

**What did I enjoy about the book?**

*   I really like the fact that they devote time to training the reader to recognize key stones.
*   I also really liked the fact that they subtly show proper use of the "empty triangle."
*   Once again, they do a great job with life and death by training even the most basic skills like "Making a Living 4-Point Eye Shape." It might seem easy, but unless it's second nature, players might actually miss it in their actual games.
*   They really try and break down the flow of moves for you. For example, the different types of blocking.
*   They start teaching how to punish overplay cuts and whether or not you should cut! *mind blown*
**What did I gain from reading this book?**

*   Continued polishing of my reading abilities.
*   Better understanding of why certain moves are considered "proper responses."
*   Gaining a higher comfort with nets and ladders.
**What style of teaching does the book use?**

*   Curriculum Style

    *   Content is organized into lessons, topics, or themes in order to facilitate learning.

*   Primary Learning Mechanism:

    *   Practice problems

*   Other Learning Mechanisms:

    *   Cute and entertaining comics to teach and/or reinforce lessons.
    *   Simple explantations that are accompanied by equally simple diagrams.
    *   Samples of openings from professional games to further acclimate the reader to full games on a 19x19 board.
**What aspect can be improved on?**

*   No complaints here!
**Is this book easy to read?**

*   Yes. Other than the occasional article, the explanations are very easy short and easy to understand.

[expand title="Recommended For..." trigclass="expandTitle"]

*   Though the series is designed for kids, both kids and adults alike will be able to learn everything they need to know about playing go in a fun and entertaining way.
