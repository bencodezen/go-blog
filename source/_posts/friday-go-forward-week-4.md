*   KGS - 4 games (2 wins : 2 losses)

## Thoughts

This week has been rather unfruitful in regards to training and what not. Been really busy with work, and as many of you are aware, I've been pretty busy trying to recap all that happened at last week's [North American Go Convention](http://www.bengozen.com/north-american-go-convention-day-1/ "North American Go Convention — Day 1"). My games have been somewhat hit or miss. Not the happiest with my performance this week, but I plan on finding ways to continue improving my game.

Meanwhile, the next week will probably be spent restructuring my schedule regarding blog posts and how training will all fit together without detracting from other aspects of my life. I'll be sure to keep everyone posted when I have a finalized schedule that you all can look forward to. =)
