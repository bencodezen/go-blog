#### Conclusion

_Opening Theory Made Easy_ is what _In the Beginning_ should have been. When a new player buys a book that says "in the beginning" and is the first volume in an "elementary" go series, you'd think that it would be simple to follow. For those who haven't invested in this series, steer clear for now. If you've already purchased it, don't worry about it. That book will be a nice book to study after you understand this one.
