### Synopsis

**What's the best aspect about this product?**

*   Gives a similar feeling of slate stones without the hefty price tag.
**What is the weakest aspect of this product?**

*   Though this is to be expected of someone who started out using yunzi stones, I found them to be a little slippery at first. However, it didn't take long before I acclimated to the stones and had no trouble using them.
**Is it durable?**

*   Based on my usage so far, I see no reason why they wouldn't last a lifetime if used properly. Doesn't seem like it would chip easily.
**Bottom Line**

1.  Easy to clean and a pleasure to use.
2.  If you like stones that are glossy and shine in the light, this is a great set for you.
3.  For those who are not yet able to afford a set of slate and shell stones, this is a great set that gives a similar feel (i.e., smooth) and look (i.e., glossiness) without the hefty price tag.

### My Review

In my go collection, I've owned my fair share of different types of stones: yunzi, slate and shell, and plastic. The funny thing is that glass stones have always been relatively inexpensive to some of the stones I have bought; but no longer, that ends with this set!

![You can see the stones packed all snuggly in there.](/images/2014/01/glassstones3603.jpg)

![As you can see, there is a bag of extra stones. My count came to 180 Black and 179 White stones along with 10 extra of each color.](/images/2014/01/glassstones3604.jpg)]

![I decided to give them a wash before using them, and this is a shot of them right after they were out of the water.](/images/2014/01/glassstones3606.jpg)

![The cleaning and drying process was pretty straight-forward. I ran them through water and then dried them with a soft towel afterwards.](/images/2014/01/glassstones3607.jpg)

![And here they are in all their beauty!](/images/2014/01/glassstones3608.jpg)

As someone who started out using yunzi stones, I was a bit surprised at how slippery it was when I first started using it. Stones would slip out of my fingers constantly. However, after a bit of patience and realizing I couldn't grip them with the same force I normally gripped yunzi stones, it came a lot easier and they did not fall out nearly as often.

At the end of the day, this is a beautiful set that any player would be delighted to have if they are looking for stones with a glossy finish that shine in the light. Highly recommended and as always, let me know if you have any questions about the set!
