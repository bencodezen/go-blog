	<p>After much thought and motivation from readers like you, I am happy to announce that Monday Go Meditations is coming back in full swing for 2014! And seeing as how this is the first post for 2014, I thought it would only be appropriate that I feature my first ranked game of 2014!</p>

	<p>I had played a free game the night before, but as I sat there on KGS, I admit that I was a little hesitant at playing a ranked game. After all, what if I played poorly? Or what if I lost? Or worst case, what if I had gotten weaker? But after a minute of doubt, I realized that I would gain nothing by sitting there worrying. So without concerning myself with the results and useless negativity, I challenged a 4 kyu to a game.* In the spirit of starting the new year with vibrant energy, I think you'll agree with me that this game is very fitting. Enjoy!</p>

## One Point Lesson

Even though I lost a large amount of stones and even lost a big chunk of territory on the top, keeping calm and maintaing my will to fight allowed me to establish a dominating lead.

_*A fun tidbit about this match is that I had actually played my opponent a month ago in an even 3k game. I didn't know it at the time, but this was actually a rematch for us. xD_
