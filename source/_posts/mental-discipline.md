Recently, I have been trying to figure out how to resolve my problem of being undisciplined when it comes to reading out sequences or figuring out what move to play next.

One of the first solutions I came up with was to simply try and practice more problems, but it didn't really seem to help much. So the next thing I tried was reading more theoretical go books in hopes of having something click inside me that would all of a sudden fix my problem. That didn't work out too well either.

After some thought, I realized that my problem is actually multidimensional.

1.  <span style="line-height: 13px;">**Physical Energy** - I have been a lot more tired than I would like to admit lately. Though I didn't recognize it at the time, it was playing a major role in my being nonchalant about what or where I played next. Â </span>
2.  **Multiple Points of Focus** - Those who know me personally will attest to the fact that I am the type who is constantly trying to multi-task and can jump from one thing to another in a blink of an eye. While that can be useful in certain contexts, it is actually becoming detrimental to my go in the long run (along with other things, but let's face it, go is the first priority here. =P).
3.  **Overload / Burnout** - As a result of the previous two points, it is only natural that my brain would eventually become overloaded and simply burnout.
It's clear that I need a reboot on my system and approach to things. To start though, I've resolved to achieve two goals: (1) Simplify &amp; Focus and (2) Gain back the physical energy that I once had.
