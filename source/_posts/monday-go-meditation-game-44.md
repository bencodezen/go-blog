## Introduction

For this week's go meditation, I am happy to welcome my friend Bonscott back to being featured on MGM. Though our KGS ranks might say there's a 3 stone difference, this game shows that the gap has closed a bit since last time we played. xD In terms of the game however, I think that this game goes to show how a lack of positional judgment and overestimation of your own territory can be the end of you. Hope you enjoy![

## **One Point Lesson**

Failing to estimate the territory on the board at all is naive and will usually lead to misfortune.
