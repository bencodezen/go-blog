	<p>For this week's go meditation, I am happy to welcome my friend Bonscott back to being featured on MGM. Though our KGS ranks might say there's a 3 stone difference, this game shows that the gap has closed a bit since last time we played. xD In terms of the game however, I think that this game goes to show how a lack of positional judgment and overestimation of your own territory can be the end of you. Hope you enjoy!</p>
