## Friday Go Forward: Week 45

## Overview

They say if you want to start out anything, start out strong. So in lieu of starting strong with the blog, I figured it wouldn't hurt to go ahead and bring back Friday Go Forwards! I'm still on the fence about the overall format of the post (in terms of making it as informative and useful to you), but I'll continue with what I have for now and hopefully inspiration will strike me (or you can leave a comment and be my muse! xD).

In terms of my progress as a player, I have rebooted my entire training regimen and am starting with the lowest common denominator: go problems. The key to any sort of growth is most certainly consistency. And since 2013 was a bit rocky for me, I would really like to use 2014 to build a well-oiled and super efficient machine. So if you're interested in trying to gain the next stone while not taking a huge amount of time, join me as I pursue the ideal training regimen.

## Training Regimen

*   **Step #1:** **Do 10 go problems a day. (Estimated time: 10-15 minutes) **Though the recommended problem set would obviously be life and death, other problems like tesuji and endgame are more than adequate. Be sure to pick problems that are around or even slightly below your level. Remember, your goal is just a bit of exposure to go everyday. And if you think it's not that much, that is the entire point. Because it's only a small mouthful, there is little excuse for not doing it everyday. Good luck!
