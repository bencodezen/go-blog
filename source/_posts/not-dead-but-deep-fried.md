No worries. I'm not dead. I apologize for not being able to update on a daily basis for the [NAGC](http://www.bengozen.com/north-american-go-convention-day-1/ "North American Go Convention — Day 1"). After Friday, there was just no way I could keep up with writing and the convention at the same time. On the upside though, there will definitely be posts coming in the near future with game reviews and all. So there should be some good content heading your way.

On another note, my brain is rather fried at the moment. So I will probably be taking the rest of the month to take time to gather my thoughts and restructure some things around to reflect some of the insight I've received this past weekend. So for the rest of February, Weekly Go Wednesday will be on a temporary break. Meanwhile, I can assure you that I will be working hard to design a new system for blog content and how I can improve my study of go in order to help you gain a better understanding of my mistakes and lessons learned. Nothing to fear though, I will still be writing frequently and keeping you all posted on my progress. =)
