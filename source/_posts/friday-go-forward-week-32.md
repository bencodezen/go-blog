## Friday Go Forward: Week 32

## Overview

It's been a rather busy week, but I think it would be fair to say it's been pretty productive! I think the biggest accomplishment is my goal to simply play at least one game a day. Though this would have seemed impossible in the past, I have been toggling back between KGS and Tygem to fulfill that discipline. In addition, I've increased my training menu to really push myself and attempt to increase my reading ability. The training menu is still far from complete, but I am definitely feeling like I have gotten one step closer to unlocking the key behind designing training menus. Very exciting!
