So today was pretty nice. Played some Settlers of Catan with my cousin, and then headed off to both the Rockville Chess and Go Club and the Greater Washington Go Club. Yuan Zhou was there reviewing games and I gotta say I learned quite a bit from that. Then I had the pleasure of meeting Nate, who is stronger than me but it seems my measly skills are adequate enough to entertain him for now. Overall, still working hard to get stronger before the second month is up. Wish me luck!
