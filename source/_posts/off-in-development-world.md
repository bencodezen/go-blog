As some of you are aware, I've gone off the deep end into the software development world. I'll be taking a longer sabbatical than anticipated; but you'll still be able to catch me for a game of go or discussion on things you can do to progress! So feel free to email me whenever and draw me out to a game on KGS whenever, because I could sure use the distraction.

Meanwhile, best of luck to everyone on their games and their progress. I definitely look forward to seeing how much everyone has grown by the time I come back! Ganbatte!

P.S. If you'd like to keep up with what I'm up to, I've created a new [Twitter](http://www.twitter.com/bencodezen) devoted to my development and UX exploits. Until then everyone!
