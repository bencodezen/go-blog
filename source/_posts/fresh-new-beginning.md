Over the weekend, in the midst of my slump, I decided to step back and take a hard look at what I had been doing and what I had to show for it. And though many of you might think otherwise, I realized that I was far behind the pack when it came to what I had accomplished so far.

Upon that realization, I decided it was time to take a sledgehammer the systems and processes that I’ve been using over these past few years. As a result, I invested a lot of time, energy, and money into getting myself back on track. After all, people out there changing the world have the same hours that I do during the day, so it was time for me to make a change so that I could join the ranks of those hyper-productive people.

What does this have to do with go? Well, as many of you know, running this blog consumes a lot of time and energy. And though it would be awesome if this were my full time job, I have many other things in my life that I need to attend to as well (i.e., my job, my girlfriend, friends, family, etc.). On top of all that, let’s not forget that I am also trying to get stronger at the same time as well! So when it comes down to it, the more inefficient I am at using my time, the more sporadic my results will be when it comes to things like my go abilities or the quality of the posts on my blog.

And though I hate to admit it, I’ve hit a roadblock with go. In reality, it probably is a multi-faceted problem that has to do with the rest of my life; but I’m not too worried about it since I think the changes I’m making will help me overcome that roadblock in time.

Being that today being the first day of July, it’s only appropriate that this mark of a fresh and new beginning. After all, weaknesses are simply opportunities to get stronger. So with that said, time to get to work.
