## Overview

As many of you know, I spent the past weekend at the [1st Washington Baduk Open Championship](http://www.bengozen.com/1st-washington-open-baduk-championship-part/ "1st Washington Open Baduk Championship — Part I") and have been therefore swamped with trying to make sure I took the time to write the posts before too much time had passed. It was an eye-opening experience that has given me an opportunity to really change my perspectives on how I've been approaching go. Especially after talking with Myung (9p) with some of his thoughts, I definitely am looking to make some changes to my training regimen.

The only other thing that's worth mentioning is that I am officially making a move away from KGS to either WBaduk or Tygem (depending on whichever I can get running on my Mac). It's not that I won't be logged in anymore or will refuse to play on it, but I'll be reserving KGS for playing with friends and anyone who asks me for a game. Otherwise, my focus on playing "ranked games" will be moving to the Korean servers. More on that to come when I have a well formulated thought as to why I'm doing this. Till next week!
