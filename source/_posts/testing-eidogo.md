EIDOGO WORKS!!! Many thanks to Nate for helping me get it up and running!!!

So here's the game I was talking about [last time](http://www.bengozen.com/string-of-games-and-failure-to-embed-eidogo/ "String of Games and Failure to Embed EidoGo"). As I'm looking over it now,Â I definitely would have played differently. Anyhow, enjoy!
