So today was productive. Two solid games under my belt. Finished <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Nihon Ki-in's Handbook of Proverbs</span> and working my way towards the finish line for <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Fundamental Principles of Go</span>. Worked solidly on <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Get Strong at Life and Death</span>.

Outside of trying to create the regimen, I'm seriously looking into programs in China/Taiwan that would allow Westerners to study Go hardcore for 3 months. Been reading blogs about the program for [Guo Juan Intensive Go Study in China](http://internetgoschool.com/goinchina.vhtml). Very interesting stuff. Will be sure to post more on my thoughts about that when I read more.

1.  Problems - 30 solid minutes.
2.  Theory - Exemplary.
3.  1 Solid Game - Completed.
Also, it's going to sound and look like I've read a ton of Go books. In theory, that means I should be growing exponentially! One little detail though, I've READ them. Comprehension is an ENTIRELY different matter. Once I work through all the ones I want to work through, re-reading and re-reviewing will be occurring. But that seems very far away.
