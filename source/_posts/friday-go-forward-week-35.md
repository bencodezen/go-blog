## Friday Go Forward: Week 35

## Overview

This week has been quite an interesting one for me. I made the decision to switch from task based productivity to time based productivity and have found it to be a much more manageable method to keeping consistent about the things that are important to me. In addition, now that I have been shifting my focus to increase the quality of my training, I am feeling a lot more at peace with my progress and don't feel like I will be burning out anytime soon. So while my training menu might seem very simple, the key factor I'm aiming for is consistency. And if I have additional time in the day, then I'm welcome to pile on any additional training that I'm in the mood for. =)
