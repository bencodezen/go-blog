For Game 4 of this epic [jubango](http://www.bengozen.com/gu-li-lee-sedol-jubango/ "Gu Li and Lee Sedol Jubango") between Lee Sedol (9P) and Gu Li (9P), with the current record being 2-1 in Lee Sedol's favor, everyone sat in anticipation as they waited to see if Gu Li would be able to even up the record! With Gu Li's record against Lee Sedol as of late though, many fans were certainly feeling that Gu Li had a great chance to win this game.

I am happy to say that today's review is forged from the combined efforts of myself and frozensoul (5d) once again! Though I didn't make this explicitly clear before, please feel free to direct any questions to him on KGS or even leave a comment below for him and he'll be sure to answer. Hope that you enjoy our game review and let us know if there's anything we can do to improve it for you!
