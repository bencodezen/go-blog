**Description:** _Essential Life &amp; Death 2_ is part of the Essential Life &amp; Death Series that is used as workbooks in private go schools in Korea. Though it might be seen as an addendum to the Level Up Series, it certainly can be used as a standalone product for anyone looking to study life and death.

### Synopsis

1.  You can expect the same quality of problems from the first volume.
2.  A great way for players to drill their life and death skills.
3.  Though I had a relatively easy time with the first volume, the problems in this book started to pose some difficulty for me.

### Before I Read This Book...

**My Abilities**

*   I've studied my fair share of life and death and can confidently say that I have a SDK (single digit kyu) level of life and death.

**My Perspective**

*   After finishing the first volume, I was expecting this book to be rather easy to do as well.

### My Review

**What did I enjoy about the book?**

*   They have no reservation in terms of making you drill the same concept repeatedly.
*   There are so many concepts and shapes in this book that makes it very valuable.
*   The review sections (e.g., quizzes) and tests do a great job helping you determine if you actually learned the lessons prior.

**What did I gain from reading this book?**

*   A broader perspective on the different variations that can arise from life and death postiions.
*   A better grasp on techniques used to either kill or save a group.
*   The problems in this book actually posed some difficulty for me at times. Being that this is the second book, it didn't take long for me to realize how weak my life and death skills really are.

**What style of teaching does the book use?**

*   Curriculum Style

		*   Content is organized into lessons, topics, or themes in order to facilitate learning.

*   Teaching Mechanism:

		*   Practice problems

**What aspect can be improved on?**

*   If I had to request one thing, it's that I was hoping that the difficulty of the problems would be more gradual. The difficulty of the problems increased faster than I was expecting. Though this should be taken with a grain of salt since I have a feeling this is just an indicator of how weak my reading abilities are instead of it being the book's problem.

**Is this book easy to read?**

*   Yes. Unless you can't read English, it really doesn't get any simpler.

### In Comparison to Similar Books...

Compared to [1001 Life and Death Problems](http://www.bengozen.com/book-review-1001-life-and-death-problems/ "Book Review: 1001 Life and Death Problems"), this series does a better job hand-holing players new to life and death through the basic shapes and variations. On the other hand, I would say that in terms of polishing a player's life and death skills, 1001 Life and Death Problems is still highly recommended. So to clarify, neither one trumps the other. Both can provide great value to a player's life and death abilities.

While [Life and Death](http://www.bengozen.com/book-review-life-and-death/ "Book Review: Life and Death") does a great job providing a broad survey of different shapes through explanations and accompanying practice problems, this series uses the "learn it through experience" methodology. Though they may overlap on a good deal of material, I believe that they complement one another and would both be of great use to serious players wanting to improve their life and death.

### Recommended For...

*   Players looking to improve their life and death skills.
*   People who prefer to learn through experience rather than explanations.
