### Detailed Review

#### Readability - 8 / 10

In this volume, we are officially in SDK (single digit kyu) land and the problems are definitely not easy to figure out. The problems are about as dense and difficult to understand as you might find in other tsumego books. Although this may seem like a negative aspect, this is actually great exposure for people who have been following this series since it builds you up to what you will find out there with other tsumego books.

#### Content Quality - 9 / 10

Similar to Volume 3, this volume is heavily focused on life and death and middle game tactics.  Definitely not one for the faint of heart.

For the first time, there is no rank recommendation on the cover; but if you can do all the problems in these book, you are most likely going to be 5 kyu or above.

#### Final Thoughts

Although I am a 6 kyu, I know that this volume is still quite difficult for me to solve correctly in a reasonable amount of time. I still make numerous errors and need the solutions in order to help guide me down the right path. As a result, you can know for sure that this book does a fantastic job filling in a gap for players in the SDK range.
