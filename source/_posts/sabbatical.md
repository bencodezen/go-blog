Sorry everyone. It's been awhile since I've been able to seriously update or post anything. I'm currently on a mini-sabbatical and trying to get a lot of things in my life straightened out.  Progress on my Go studies has been close to none so it'll be interesting to see how I do when I get back to the game.  I'm planning on doing a major overhaul on the blog so that it is a bit easier to navigate and just heavier on content. So I'll be back in a week to give you guys what I'll be projecting.  Till then!
