## Introduction

For this week's go meditation, we continue our journey down memory lane! Last week I was a mere 15 kyu, but this week we jump ahead to when I gained my first stone! Kageyama says that one of the greatest enjoyments of go is gaining a stone in strength (which obviously becomes far less frequent as one gets stronger); but I do remember the excitement of seeing my rank tick up a number. Haha. Anyways, I hope that you'll find humor and enjoyment as you watch my past self flail around the board. =D See you next week! [

## **One Point Lesson**

While it feels good to fight and gain a chunk of center territory, the territory you typically give away on the sides and corners will exceed your center gain.
