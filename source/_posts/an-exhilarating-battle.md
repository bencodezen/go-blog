_In light of the new blog redesign and format, I will also be including a new section in every game that I post: My Opponent, Mistakes and (if relevant) Prized Moments. [OUTDATED]_

**Overall**

This has got to be the most intensive game that I've played in quite awhile. For those who haven't been following, I joined the ASR League and have been playing a lot of even games with people who are much stronger than I. As a result, I've been on an incredible losing streak and have had a hard time regaining my composure.

Today's game is probably one of the best games that I've played in quite awhile. It's not the fact that I won, but the fact that a majority of my moves were well thought out and expose weaknesses that I would've never been able to exploit before. Not to mention that the ability to all of a sudden see the value of each move as I fought multiple ko battles was incredible.

It's as Toshiro Kageyama said in <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Lessons in the Fundamentals of Go</span>, the ability to actually read something out and knowing what will happen not only boosts a player's confidence but brings an entirely new appreciation for the game.

**My Opponent**

Honestly, my hat is off to my opponent. Based on the screenname, I'm going to assume that she is a girl. That being said, she was amazing to play with. She really took her time with her moves and I could definitely tell that she was reading everything to the best of her ability. It ended up causing her to lose on time, but it really was a magnificent game.

**Mistakes**

*   Move 68 (L12) - This wasn't necessary. I should have skipped this and moved onto P16 first. I was lucky my opponent responded to it.
*   Move 80 (N17) - Should've been played at M18.
*   Move 108 (E10) - Should've been played at E9 or E8.
*   Move 142 (H18) - I read out a capturing race that I thought I could win. One liberty short...
*   Move 158 (J11) - This was a reckless move. There was not way I was going to live. I shouldn't have even bothered.
*   Move 194 (P4) - This was really small. Too slow.
*   Move 198 (Q13) - Again. I'm luckily my opponent kept responding to local moves, but this was slow.
*   Move 296 (F6) - I didn't read the follow-up properly. White not only has no good follow up, but an incorrect response would kill the H2/D6 group.
**Prized Moments**

*   Move 56 (P15) - I managed to read out a relatively complicated sequence that gave my group a chance to live if I fought well.
*   Move 72 (N16) - Words cannot describe being able to read this out...
*   Move 174 (G2) - I was glad I could see the importance of this move, and my gut told me that if my opponent wasn't careful, things were going to be pretty bad for her.
*   Move 260 (C1) + Following Sequence - *tears of joy*
*   Move 310 (S10) &amp; 312 (R7) - Endgame awesomeness....
