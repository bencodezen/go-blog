<div style="clear: both; text-align: left;">

So I know I wrote about coming back from the sabbatical, but it looks like I'll have to retract that statement unfortunately. There are some things that have come up in my life that are going to require a significant amount of attention and energy. So it'll be some time before I will be able to attend to Go for awhile. I'm more than willing to play with anyone here and there if they want. The difference is that I won't be able to just hang around KGS anymore to play.

To all my fellow Go players, thanks for all the help so far. I'm sorry I have to dip for a little while, but rest assured you can always get a game with me anytime you like. Just shoot me an e-mail or comment on the blog and we'll set something up. Take care everyone!
