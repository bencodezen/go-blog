As of late, I have been finding it difficult to really get my head in the game. I'm not sure if it's due to the busy schedule of having relatives from out of town, or whether my mind is undergoing some new twists and turns that is changing the way I see the game.

For those who have been keeping up with my progress, you probably remember that I mentioned a recently gained ability to estimate territory. Unfortunately though, it seems like my mind is once again becoming adverse to doing it and it's causing me to just play moves on a local scale (which is turning out terribly might I add). And as if that wasn't bad enough, I've gotten into a bad habit of not fully reading moves out before I play. This is ends up causing a vicious cycle of where I end up playing regrettable moves because of laziness as opposed to not seeing a particular sequence.  Oy vey...

To counter these bad habits, I'm going back to the basics and doing life and death problems the old fashioned way: Read it till you figure it out. No more exposure to new material. Just a good ol' fashioned tsumego drills. In addition, I've started Cho Chikun's book on <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Positional Judgment</span> to hopefully get myself more comfortable with evaluating the whole board. We'll see how it goes...

_Also, for those who enjoy game commentaries, you should definitely check out my long time friend and rival's new [post](http://nateeagle.com/2013/06/10/workshop-game-against-a-new-little-brother/) on a game he played recently at [Yuan Zhou](http://zhouyuan.com/)'s Workshop! It is a fun exciting game that shows an excellent command of play by Black and numerous examples of how overplays are supposed to be punished. Definitely worth checking out!_
