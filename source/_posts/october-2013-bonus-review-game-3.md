For this week's bonus review, we will be going over my third game from the Canada Go League where I suffer a one-sided defeat. There is no excuse for the mistakes I made (both strategically and tactically), but the only thing I will say in my defense is that I tried out a lot of new experiments this game. And the thing to realize about experiments is that they often blow up in your face. This is a great example of one of them. Haha. xD Enjoy![
