## Introduction

First and foremost, I will start by stating this game was played on [OGS](http://online-go.com/user/view/549/BenGoZen) recently.  Two reasons for that: (1) I don't want you to think that this is an old game. (2) Although my rank says 7k, the ranks in OGS are completely weird and is really a poor indicator of your true skill level. So in other words, my opponent could be way stronger than 7k. That being said, this game is a weird one where my opponent played a lot of odd moves. Overplays if you ask me, but I'll let you be the judge of that. Enjoy![

## **One Point Lesson**

When you encounter a weird playing style, play calm and do not get drawn in by your opponent's wild antics.
