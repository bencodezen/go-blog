I haven't had a chance to really talk about this much, but I'm actually going to be headed to Hong Kong in less than a week! As you might expect, it's been a busy rush to get all my ducks in line and make sure I don't have any lingering things to do when I leave.

One of the things I'm pondering about however, is how I'm going to be utilizing my time during those long hours on the plane. I'm debating bringing a magnetic go set so I can use it on the plane, but then I worry that I'll spill the bowls and all the pieces will go everywhere on the plane. Still a little on the fence about what I'm going to do, but so far it seems like I might just use it to do some serious life and death studying. I'm open to suggestions though!

Most importantly, **if ANYONE has any connections to people who play go in Hong Kong (or know a friend of a friend who might be able to help me out)**, please let me know since I would love to be able to do at least one go related activity while in Hong Kong. It would be awesome if I could play with some locals and have something go-related to commemorate the trip with!

I definitely will be doing a post on my Hong Kong trip after I get back, but I'm really hoping to have some go-related material in there if possible. Although worst case scenario, you'll just have to endure numerous photos of food and stories instead. Guess that's not so bad right? But it would definitely be epic if I could have at least one go anecdote in there, here's to hoping...
