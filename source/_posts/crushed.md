Man.... I'm used to being destroyed by my opponents... but this guy had an annoying mouth and I was destroyed by him.  The way he took advantage of almost every single weakness was quite beyond me.  I think I was doing okay in the opening, but then I didn't properly chase down what should've been a dead group.  Ugh. Can't even comment on the game.  But for all those players looking to see bad aji come back and kick you in the balls, and the usage of a double ko to kill of groups that were supposed to be alive: this is the game.
