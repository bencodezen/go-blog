### Before I Read This Book...

**My Abilities**

*   My style of play is a fighting style. The problem that often occurs is that I often find myself overextended or playing moves that seem like they are "attacking" but put no pressure on the opponent.

**My Perspective**

*   I was really hoping to get a better understanding of attack and defense so that I could really sharpen my blade and increase the potency of my attacks. In addition, I was hoping to get a better understanding of how to defend properly since I hardly hesitate to invade.

### My Review

**What did I enjoy about the book?**

*   There is an anecdote about a player who felt that "territory meant nothing unless it contained a dead group" that was incredibly eye-opening and changed the way I saw attacking groups.
*   Does a great job explaining topics (that previously seemed hard to grasp) such as power, forcing moves, inducing moves, etc.
*   The problems at the end of the book were a great way for me to see if I understood what I had been learning.

**What did I gain from reading this book?**

*   A much better understanding of attacking, defense, and the importance and role that power plays in a game.
*   An improvement in my ability to attack groups properly.
*   A better understanding of how to find multi-purpose moves that serve both attack and defense purposes.

**What style of teaching does the book use?**

*   Lecture Approach

		*   The writing is far more substantial in this book than what readers might have become accustomed to in Tesuji and Life and Death.

*   Primary Learning Mechanism:

		*   Explanations with diagrams

*   Other Learning Mechanisms:

		*   Practice problems
		*   Examples from actual games

**What aspect(s) can be improved on?**

*   In all honesty, I have a hard time finding anything to criticize about this book; but if I had to request one thing, it would have to be more problems at the end of the book to continue reinforcing what I learned.

**Is this book easy to read?**

*   Yes. The writing style in this book makes you feel as if you are having a conversation with Davies and Ishida, which ultimately makes for an enjoyable read.

### Recommended For...

*   Players looking for a reference on numerous shapes that are frequently encountered in games.
*   Players who have read other life and death books and are looking to expand their knowledge and test their skills.
