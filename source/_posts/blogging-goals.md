So in lieu of trying to gain more credibility as a Go expert and blogger, I'll be trying to implement the following goals for increasing blogging content:

1.  5 posts a week concerning my personal progress as a player.
2.  2 Go book reviews per month.
3.  1 Go equipment review per week.
4.  1 Go Guide per week.
5.  1 Weekly and Monthly Overview on my progress as well.
Let's see how this goes for the month of October.
