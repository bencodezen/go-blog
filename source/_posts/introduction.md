Welcome to BenGoZen! As you might've read in the description, this blog is for anyone looking for some personalized Go experience and advice. In case some of you haven't had the pleasure of reading ChiyoDad's blog, he has about three years of blogging logged in. Even though he has some great information, I thought I'd take to a blog with a more personal touch and hopefully more guidance for those who are new to the game or are looking to improve.

So in case you are wondering how the blog got its name, it's quite simple.

Ben - My name

Go - The name of the game and a pun on the verb as well.

+ Zen - The calming state I get when playing the game.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

= BenGoZen!

In addition, it's also three mono-syllabic words strung together with a rhyme which I thought would be catchy. (Hopefully I won't be the only one)

As the blog posts fill up, be sure to use the search box if you are searching for something specific. I'll keep the titles simple so that you'll hopefully find what you're looking for without much difficulty. (e.g. If you want book reviews, type "book reviews")

In addition, any links that I post up on the sidebars are sites that I personally have verified and believe to be useful or reliable. This is particularly directed at the "Places to Buy Go Stuff" list since I wouldn't want you purchasing from anywhere that I had no experience with. Also, the links and blogs will be exclusively English for now since I assume a number of players reading my blog won't know Japanese of Chinese. If there is a demand for it, let me know and I'll start posting those blogs too.

Sorry for the long introduction, but I hope it gets you a better idea of what BenGoZen is all about and how to best use it for your Go needs.
