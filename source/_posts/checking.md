Sorry for being MIA this past week. As most of you know, the U.S. Go Congress 2014 was last week, so I was swamped as you can imagine. Like I’ve done before for previous events, you can be sure that I’ll be doing a day by day recount of the Go Congress for those who couldn’t make it!

In terms of a short term update though, things are starting to look better. The Go Congress helped to provide perspective for me in terms of where my efforts and energy really need to be invested in order for me to see the results that I want. It’ll be different from my past approaches (where there was a high risk of burnout), so I’m looking forward to seeing what happens with this new approach.

Hope that everyone is doing well!
