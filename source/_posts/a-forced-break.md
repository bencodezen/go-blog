So like most people, my world is not solely my own and is constantly impacted by the people around me.  This has forced me to take a break from playing full games of Go online, but on the upside I've been trying to take what Justin advised me to do to heart.

After reflecting on it for some time, I realized that most of my frustrations come from the fact that my visualization and ability to read ahead is undisciplined and ill-trained at the moment.  Like Justin said, no amount of theories will be able to correct for that.  Agreed.  I will be working hard to finish up any remaining books that I started so that there aren't a bunch of half-read books on my bookshelf, but afterwards I'll be sure to dive headfirst into all the problem books I own.
