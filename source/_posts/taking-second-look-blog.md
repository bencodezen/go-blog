Lately I've been reconsidering what direction the blog has been heading in. Although it's been great starting a new series and having content flow consistently, lately the blog has felt more like a newspaper or e-magazine of sorts instead of a personal journal. For example, the game reviews that are being published are now usually like a month behind where I am now, which can be confusing for you as a reader and also throws my blog into a weird clashing timeline.

As a result, I've been thinking a lot about what I can do to fix that, and I've come up with the following items in order to better optimize my time and produce content that better fits my vision for the blog:

Starting next week...

1.  **Thursday Go Tygem will now be discontinued** in order to pave way for #2 and #3.
2.  **Monday Go Meditation is going to undergo a reboot** with an updated format that takes some elements of Thursday Go Tygem and should improve the overall quality and value of the weekly column. In addition, I will be clearing out the queue in Monday Go Meditation in order to make way for current games and realign the blog with the games I'm currently playing as opposed to games I played weeks or even months ago.
3.  **There will be a new post every weekday (i.e. Mon-Fri)**. This might seem extreme and be a point of concern for some, but I've reached a new level of comfort with my blogging that should make this very viable. I'm hoping that this should help the blog start to return to its origins of being a chronicle of my journey (in real-time).

In addition, you'll start noticing little changes around the blog like new tagging or categories appear as I restructure the content in order to make it more user friendly, but those shouldn't impact your reading experience on the blog much.

Starting in July...

1.  **I'm going to update the format and change the schedule of Friday Go Forward **- Although some don't realize it, Friday Go Forward currently captures my progress from the last Friday afternoon/evening to the next Thursday evening since it gets published every Friday morning. In order to better capture my weekly progress, I will be changing it to Saturday so it fully captures that week. In addition, everyone's feedback  was really helpful on figuring out next steps, so be on the lookout in the future for an improved format!

Whew. Been meaning to unload that from my brain for some time. I'm hoping that you'll like these new changes; but as always, please be sure to leave feedback in case I'm missing something or you see something I can do to improve what you're seeing here on the blog. See you around!
