	<p>For today's go meditation, I will be featuring a second one of my games from Tygem with another 3 dan! This time I am playing White and actually manage to legitimately win! (Though <a href="/2013/10/14/monday-go-meditation-game-31/">last week's game</a> is technically a legitimate win, I feel like I was lucky with the capturing race on the right.) This game is a great example of how losing whole board vision for even just one move can make a huge difference in the outcome of the game. Fortunately for me, it didn't cost me the game this time; but it very well could have. Enjoy!</p>
