## Introduction

For today's go meditation, I will be featuring a second one of my games from Tygem with another 3 dan! This time I am playing White and actually manage to legitimately win! (Though [last week's game](http://www.bengozen.com/monday-go-meditation-game-31/ "Monday Go Meditation: Game 31") is technically a legitimate win, I feel like I was lucky with the capturing race on the right.) This game is a great example of how losing whole board vision for even just one move can make a huge difference in the outcome of the game. Fortunately for me, it didn't cost me the game this time; but it very well could have. Enjoy![

## **One Point Lesson**

When preparing to deal with an opponent's moyo, make sure that the rest of your groups are strong and stable before invading and creating a complicated mess on the board.
