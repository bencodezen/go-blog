## Overview

This has been a rather rough week for me. I have lost pretty much every game I've played and even lost my crucial match in Yunguseng Dojang (YSD). And to be honest, I was so frustrated with how I played that game I couldn't even stay for the review afterwards. Sigh. And though I've resolved not to take a break at this time, I think I will be meeting everyone halfway by simply taking a break from playing games (except for my regularly schedule YSD match).

I also have a lot going through my mind in regards to how I've been spending my time and how to get out of my turmoil. So my training regimen has been cut down again because I'm not sure what I'm doing anymore. I apologize for this week's progress report being a little short on the content, but I have a new vision for what it'll be soon. So I'll be working on that in conjunction with taking a second look at my approach to everything. Hope you all are having a better week than I am.
