Hey everyone. Sorry that I’ve been MIA for a while. As you might have guessed, I’ve been caught up with work along with the many obligations that come with the holiday season. Lots of late nights, running errands, cooking, cleaning, etc.

While I haven’t been able to blog as much as I would like, I couldn’t bear the thought of ending 2014 without some sort of retrospective.

In terms of how the year has gone, it has been a rather introspective one that was fraught with a lot of anxieties and insecurities that plagued me subconsciously. Though it’s rather unfortunate that it took me so long to identify the issue at hand, it has been an important discovery that has allowed me to start fixing a lot of different aspects in my life. So once again, I have another thing to add on to the list of reasons I’m thankful that go is in my life.

And while the standard practice is to make big overtures about what the next year will bring, I think I’ll take a page from modesty this time around. No grand gestures of blogging everyday or playing 100 games in a month. Instead, I’ll just let you know what I have in mind for next year:

1.  Actually play games and not just study.
2.  Find a groove that works for my blogging. I know what I want ideally, but it’s time I found the right balance for consistency.

With that said and done, I also want to take the time to thank everyone for their support of the blog. Your comments and words of advice and encouragement have been key in helping me persist through times of difficulty. I hope that you all have a great New Years Eve and will have an even better 2015\. Till next year!
