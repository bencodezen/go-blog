I've played my fair share of ranked games lately, and one thing that I have noticed about myself: **I do not like 10 minute ranked games**. Although I've always considered myself more of less a fast player, I realized that I actually like (and need) to have a decent amount of time to think through what I'm doing. In today's kifu, I found myself hitting byoyomi pretty quickly and then playing the later portion of the middle game and endgame in sudden death. And in my experience, that is the time where any mistakes made will usually turn the game around. I was scrambling to try and find the best moves without accidentally killing myself. Enjoy watching as I squirm and have only my instinct to help me make the correct moves.
