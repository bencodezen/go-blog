**My Abilities**

*   I've read a fair share of books and feel decently knowledgeable about the basic tactics and strategy of the game.
**My Perspective**

*   As a kyu player, I am still trying to figure out what's wrong with my play so that I can traverse into the dan levels. So I'm hoping this book will shed some light on that.

[expand title="My Review" trigclass="expandTitle" expanded="true"]

The first chapter, which explains the misconceptions players have when playing go, is not particularly long; but the information is absolutely critical. The beauty of it all is that it's delivered in an extremely concise manner. No wading through a ton of terms just to understand what 1+1 is.

In addition, while incorporating principles of play into his analysis, a second aspect that I absolutely love in these chapters is the fact that we get to find out why the players played the way they did. (I don't know about you, but that really helps to make me feel less alienated since I'm like, "Hey! I've thought that too before!") Once you are given the player's reasoning (e.g. Black felt that white's area was too big), Zhou gives immediate explanation for why it is faulty. SCORE!

I also have to admit that it is actually more advanced that I thought when I first bought it. I'm not sure whether it's just me, but I have always found example games to be rather hard to learn from since the reviews tend to require a well rounded understanding of all go basics in order for the game review to make much sense. As a result, the only real critique I have for the book is that it should be revised to be more robust with practice problems (or multiple choice questions) to further help reinforce the principles that so many kyu players violate.

Overall though, I would still have to say that Zhou does a great job trying to provide some guidance for kyu players on habits that most players fail to realize are holding them back. I can definitely say that I still fall victim to some of the things that Zhou talks about. Definitely worth purchasing if you're a kyu player and feel stuck no matter how many new tactics and tesujis you learn.
