summary: >
	<p>Hello again everyone! As I start to get the ball rolling on everything again, I thought it was only appropriate to feature my game with whynotnow. Without going into too much detail, this friendly game was an important moment in my return to the game as I was still on the fence about playing at the time. And as my luck would have it, whynotnow came at the right time and place. Hope you enjoy it!</p>
