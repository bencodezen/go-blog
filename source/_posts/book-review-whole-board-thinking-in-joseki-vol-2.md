[expand title="Synopsis" trigclass="expandTitle" expanded="true"]

1.  Continues to live up to the quality of problems and explanations you come to expect from this series.
2.  Does a great job exposing players to new joseki/variations they might never encounter due to the lack of popularity with the high and far kakari.
3.  The content is not reliant on having read the first volume.

[expand title="Before I Read This Book..." trigclass="expandTitle"]

**My Abilities**

*   Although I've had some exposure to joseki, I have avoided studying them like the plague. I really, really don't like studying joseki.
**My Perspective**

*   After reading the first volume, I was excited to get started on this volume to continue seeing how good my whole board thinking was.

[expand title="My Review" trigclass="expandTitle" expanded="true"]

**What did I enjoy about the book?**

*   Really simple and easy to understand explanations for positions that were once foreign to me.
*   Does a great job keeping the opening to a realistic scenario that you might actually see in your own game.
*   Shows the reader that there can be more than one right answer in a position.
**What did I gain from reading this book?**

*   Improved understanding of how certain moves work with the board as a whole.
*   Reduction in kyu tunnel vision since I have more practice considering the whole board position.
*   Slightly better understanding of joseki patterns for the 3-4 point, high and far kakari. Though in all honesty, I've already forgotten most of it already. Haha.
**What style of teaching does the book use?**

*   Off the Cliff Style

		*   There is no gradual progression into the material.
		*   You learn through trial and error as you progress through the book.

*   Primary Learning Mechanism:

		*   Multiple choice practice problems.

*   Other Learning Mechanisms:

		*   Clear and concise explanations with an accompanying diagram to illustrate his point.
**What aspect can be improved on?**

*   They need to come out with another volume on star point joseki! That would be awesome!
**Is this book easy to read?**

*   Absolutely. The explanations are no longer than a paragraph long and are very clear and concise.

[38 Basic Joseki](http://www.bengozen.com/book-review-38-basic-joseki/ "Book Review: 38 Basic Joseki"), like most joseki books, actually focuses on teaching the reader about the various sequences from joseki. There is some mention of how they affect the board as a whole, but there is a lack of illustration as to how it is truly impacted. Whole Board Thinking in Joseki, on the other hand, does a perfect job filling this gap.
