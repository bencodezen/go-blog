## **Overview**

As many of you probably noticed, I have been pretty consumed with studying go and releasing book reviews as fast as I can. My progress with the Level Up series has been great! I've been averaging about 1.5 days for each volume. Not as fast as I wish I was, but not bad in the scheme of things. It's been really great to see what kids in Korea have been learning and realizing how unstable my fundamentals were in comparison. I'm hoping that I will be finished with the Level Up series by next week so that I can find out what's in store for me in the Jump Level Up series.

Also, many thanks to Malcolm for setting me on the path to finally working out the kinks in the email subscriptions. As some of you might have noticed, email newsletters are going to be looking a lot different! The design is far from finished, but I wanted to at least release the initial version of the email layout so that you wouldn't have to deal with the horrendous layout that Jetpack was sending at one point. Hope it makes for a better reading experience!

****Update:** It seems that Jetpack was still turned on this morning so the email newsletter might have been sent twice. Sorry to anyone on the subscriber list! I am working to iron out all the kinks with the new email subscription plugin.
