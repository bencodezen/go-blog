	<p>With this week, we continue on with Game #2 of <a href="http://www.thegochallenge.blogspot.com.au/2014/04/april-challenge.html">Maaike's April Challenge</a>! Even though the game ended up culminating into a rather large capturing race, I felt that my decisions leading up to it were calm as a whole. Instead of trying to turn it into a capturing race from the beginning, there were a number of times when I would offer the possibility of a peaceful resolution. So in that regard, I believe that I was successful in playing a calm game. Hopefully you'll think so too!</p>
