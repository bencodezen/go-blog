## Introduction

With this week, we continue on with Game #2 of Maaike's [April Challenge](http://www.thegochallenge.blogspot.com.au/2014/04/april-challenge.html "Maaike")! Even though the game ended up culminating into a rather large capturing race, I felt that my decisions leading up to it were calm as a whole. Instead of trying to turn it into a capturing race from the beginning, there were a number of times when I would offer the possibility of a peaceful resolution. So in that regard, I believe that I was successful in playing a calm game. Hopefully you'll think so too!

## **One Point Lesson**

When all hopes seems lost, one must consider all moves before giving up, even the empty triangle.
