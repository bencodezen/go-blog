Although progress seems to have been a bit slow, I’m happy to report that I actually finished Jump Level Up 2 recently. When I first started the book, I have to admit that I was concerned it would take too long; but before I knew it, it’s finished and I’m onto the next volume! Hoorah for steady progress.

Even though I have some concern regarding my lack of playing, I’m still happy that I’m able to continue studying at a consistent pace amidst the craziness of life. In the meantime, I’ll just continue living vicariously through my friends and look forward to the day I will be playing consistently.
