Today I played an interesting teaching game with frozensoul. After losing (as I normally do), he made a very insightful comment about my play: I have a tendencyÂ to settle positions quickly. In other words, instead of keeping my options open, I choose to instead play out a local area to completion before I'm entirely sure of what my strategy is for the game. As a result, it becomes a lot easier for stronger opponents to figure out what I'm aiming at and ultimately nullify it.

Though I try to keep as open a mind as possible in every game, it seems that I still fail to appreciate how much freedom players actually have during a game. You want to play three moves in a corner to try and eliminate my stone's aji? No problem. I'll go ahead and take the 2 other big points on the board and laugh maniacally later when my stone's aji still comes back to bite you in the butt.

No longer do I wish to be imprisoned by my own volition and stubbornness. Go is a game of freedom. So from this moment forth, I will stop trying to see the game from the confines of everything I learned thus far. Instead, I will try to see the board as it truly is: a beautifully endless depth of possibilities and creativity.
