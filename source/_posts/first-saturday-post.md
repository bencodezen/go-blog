So I think this is my first official Saturday post in terms of posting a game and giving an overview as to my progress. Last night I visited the GWGC, but it was relatively uneventful... just a friendly sparring match with my cousin. For him, go is far more of a recreational activity. So I tried to give him four stones, but that wasn't not enough of a handicap. Oh well, we'll try six stones next time.

In terms of Go study, that's kind of been slowed down a bit. Job hunt and school are taking a lot more of my time these days (which it should =D), but I've tried to play at least one to two games a day. Today I played one against an 18k, but it was utter destruction. Unless people would like me to post it up, I'll post the second game I played yesterday against a 11kyu. It was more or less speed Go for me since I only had 10 min main time. He loss on time, but it'd be nice to get some commentaries on whether I would've been able to actually win. Cheers!
