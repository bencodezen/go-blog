I have no idea what's going on. It's like whenever I play a ranked game, my personality changes and I become hell-bent on destroying groups. Any notion of growth or progress that I've made seems to be thrown out the window. How frustrating!

I think part of my problem is that I stop reading when I play people around my rank. I just play moves that feel okay and then try and repair the damage later on. In addition, I have no notion of giving any leeway to my opponent. It's quite mind boggling...

A game of go is a game of go... It should make absolutely no difference if it is ranked or free. The problem now is to figure out how to hit my zen state when playing ranked games...
