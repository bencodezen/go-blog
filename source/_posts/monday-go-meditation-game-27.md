## Introduction

For today's go meditation, I am featuring first true ranked game as a 4 kyu. Though it is a game that I manage to convincingly win, it is important to note that I was very lucky to have an opponent respond to my taunts to fight. If my opponent had simply played a bit more lightly and watched the connections, that the game would probably have looked more like a charging bull running in circles. In terms of what I think you can take away from the game however, it would probably be how I am able to control the game and ensure my opponent is not given a single chance to reverse the game through calm analysis and play. I hope you enjoy![

## **One Point Lesson**

** When you are clearly winning, never underestimate the power of light and stable plays that reduce your opponent while solidifying your positions.**
