I’ve decided to give [Dragon Go Server](http://www.dragongoserver.net/index.php "Dragon Go Server") another shot. While I had some issues with it in the past, I’m ready to approach it again from a more calm approach. In other words, I won’t be in a rush to make my move or finish games. Instead, I’ll view each move as a problem for me to solve. No more, no less. So go ahead and send your challenges. I await them in anticipation!
