## Friday Go Forward: Week 49

## Overview

Another week has passed me by and man have I been swamped. On the upside, I am starting to be able to grasp my to-do list and really start cutting it down to size. It's certainly been a big relief as I continue working on multiple aspects of my life. Once again, I must apologize for being so absent this week; but I am really hoping to be coming back full swing with real consistency soon. So until then, hope all is well with you and your journey to gaining the next stone!

PS. I've updated my [Leather Goban Review](http://www.bengozen.com/equipment-review-leather-goban/ "Equipment Review: Leather Goban") to include information on how it was made. Be sure to check it out if you haven't read it already!
