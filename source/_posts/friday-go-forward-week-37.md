## Friday Go Forward: Week 37

## Overview

After attempting to try and play one real time game every day (and then every other day), the realities finally set in and I decided that the only work around to not going long periods of not playing go was to ramp up my activity on [Nova.gs](http://www.nova.gs). As much as correspondence games do not hold quite the same value as real time games (since your thoughts are often disjointed and your ideas are constantly changing which means you might not like the plan you came up with 2 days ago), I have found them to be a convenient and effective way to ensure that I'm not rusty when it comes time to play a game in real time. Otherwise, things have been pretty solid and I'm continuing onwards with my training regimen. Till next week!
