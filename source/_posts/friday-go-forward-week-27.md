## Friday Go Forward: Week 27

## Overview

Though this week cannot even begin to live up to 1% of the awesomeness that is happening on at US Go Congress, I will have to say that it has been a rather productive week. I've started really diving into some new books in an effort to really further my understanding of my failure as a player: the inability to attack properly. If you're wondering why I make it sound so dramatic, it's because I always considered myself more of a fighter / power type of player, and what kind of fighter or power player am I if I can't even attack properly? Haha. =D But I think I'm making good headway on that, so hopefully I won't have to write about this weakness of mine for much longer. Till next week!
