### Before I Read This Book...

**My Abilities**

*   A mid to high SDK (single digit kyu) kyu who has read his fair share of go books and has a pretty strong foundation in the basics and teaching go.

**My Perspective**

*   I started making more errors in Level Up 9, but it definitely taught me some things about my instinctual reading abilities. So I'm looking forward to what the final installment has in store for me!.

### My Review

**What did I enjoy about the book?**

*   I like how they correct basic misconceptions (that are rampant even in SDK games I've watched) like trying to block on the second line by hane early in the game.
*   I really like they show possible mistakes in joseki and teaches the reader how to handle them.
*   Introduces the reader to different techniques in winning capturing races.
*   Already starts to get the player to start being wary of trick plays, albeit not vey complicated ones.

**What did I gain from reading this book?**

*   A better understanding of the reason behind certain moves in joseki.
*   Firmer grasp of fundamental principles behind haengma (i.e. movement of the stones).
*   Greater comfort with capturing races and some of the techniques behind winning them.
*   Polished my reading abilities.

**What style of teaching does the book use?**

*   Curriculum Style

		*   Content is organized into lessons, topics, or themes in order to facilitate learning.

*   Primary Learning Mechanism:

		*   Practice problems

*   Other Learning Mechanisms:

		*   Cute and entertaining comics to teach and/or reinforce lessons.
		*   Simple explantations that are accompanied by equally simple diagrams.
		*   Samples of openings from professional games to further acclimate the reader to full games on a 19x19 board.

**What aspect can be improved on?**

*   Page 95 Problem 6 has no solution aka impossible to solve.
*   On a rare occassion, the directions don't quite match up to the problem (e.g., P.163 #4).

**Is this book easy to read?**

*   Yes. Other than the occasional article, the explanations are very easy short and easy to understand.

### Recommended For...

*   Though the series is designed for kids, both kids and adults alike will be able to learn everything they need to know about playing go in a fun and entertaining way.
*   People who enjoy learning things in an easy to understand format and lots of opportunities to reinforce what they are learning.
