## Overview

As I'm sure you all have noticed, I have finally gotten around to releasing my [Hong Kong trip series](http://www.bengozen.com/hong-kong-trip-part-1/ "Hong Kong Trip: Part 1 — The Scenery") this week! It took quite a few hours to work through all the photos and then make sure they were ready for viewing, but if you all enjoyed the posts, then I think it was plenty worthwhile.

With that said, I have been starting to approach my life with a lot more vigor. One of the things I've gotten back to doing consistently is going to my local boxing gym. Even though this takes up a lot of time throughout the week, I think that we often underestimate the connection between physical and mental conditioning. Both must be optimal in order for them to work together harmoniously. In addition, I've started watching more [Yunguseng Dojang](http://www.yunguseng.com "Yunguseng Dojang Official Website") lectures and changed up my training a bit.

Over the past week, I got a chance reconnect with Lynx on KGS and we had a fun teaching game. I lost of course, but after a bit of discussion, she showed me an article she wrote on "[How to Improve at Go](http://shobia.com/w/How_to_Improve_at_Go "Lynx")." While I could write a whole post about the various things I like about the article (which will probably happen in the near future when I have a moment to breathe), the main thing that stuck out to me was her emphasis on tesuji problems rather than life and death problems. As a result, you'll notice my training regimen has changed a bit from before.

I'm still trying to create a training schedule that works well for me, so you'll have to bear with me as I continue to experiment and try different things. It's particularly volatile at the moment, but a large part is due to the fact that I really want to be in a stable position when the [Yunguseng Dojang](http://www.yunguseng.com "Yunguseng Dojang Official Website") starts in May. So I'm really testing the waters in various areas to see what works best for me. Just have to keep trying.
