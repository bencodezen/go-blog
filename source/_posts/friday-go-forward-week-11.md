## Thoughts

Biggest concern: Way too many turn based games going on. I know it works for some people, but I get overly focused on them and then everything else around me falls to the wayside. No no no... so as I wrote [yesterday](http://www.bengozen.com/overloaded/ "Overloaded"), no more games with strangers. Haha. And to be honest, I'm feeling the studying is a little too light, so hopefully I can find a better balance for myself next week!
