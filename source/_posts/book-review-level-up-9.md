[expand title="Before I Read This Book..." trigclass="expandTitle"]

**My Abilities**

*   A mid to high SDK (single digit kyu) kyu who has read his fair share of go books and has a pretty strong foundation in the basics and teaching go.
**My Perspective**

*   Level Up 8 definitely gave me quite a bit to pause about, so I wasn't taking any chances with this one either.

[expand title="My Review" trigclass="expandTitle" expanded="true"]

**What did I enjoy about the book?**

*   Starts training the reader to look for the key stones.
*   Trains the reader to look for weak points in shapes for life and death.
*   Exposes the reader to a number of joseki using knowledge that one should have gained from the previous volumes.
**What did I gain from reading this book?**

*   Realization that I'm actually kind of slow when it comes to recognizing which stones are critical.
*   A better understanding of why certain joseki progress the way they do.
*   Improved baseline when it comes to reading basic life and death situations.
**What style of teaching does the book use?**

*   Curriculum Style

		*   Content is organized into lessons, topics, or themes in order to facilitate learning.

*   Primary Learning Mechanism:

		*   Practice problems

*   Other Learning Mechanisms:

		*   Cute and entertaining comics to teach and/or reinforce lessons.
		*   Simple explantations that are accompanied by equally simple diagrams.
		*   Samples of openings from professional games to further acclimate the reader to full games on a 19x19 board.
**What aspect can be improved on?**

*   No complaints here!
**Is this book easy to read?**

*   Yes. Other than the occasional article, the explanations are very easy short and easy to understand.
