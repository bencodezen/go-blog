## Overview

During the past few weeks, I ended up skewing my training to playing games and sacrificing study in order to re-acclimate myself to playing games again. As a result, my weaknesses became very clear as I would lose game after game after game.

After [discovering my Master Wu](http://www.bengozen.com/discovering-master-wu/ "Discovering My “Master Wu”"), my training has once again gone under another stage of growth as I really begin to immerse myself in practicing "deep learning" as is discussed in [The Talent Code](http://www.amazon.com/The-Talent-Code-Greatness-Grown/dp/055380684X).  And though it's too early to tell if it's working, I feel like the wheels of progress are beginning to turn. Fingers crossed that I'm not wrong. Haha.

## Lessons Learned

*   Though difficult to grasp, learning how to make proper trades throughout your game is one of the key milestones to being a strong player. This is particularly evident in the way Go Seigen plays (and yes admittedly difficult to do).
*   As I replay more and more of Go Seigen's kifu, I've realized how constricted my go has become. It is missing the freedom that is so glaringly exists in Go Seigen's games.
