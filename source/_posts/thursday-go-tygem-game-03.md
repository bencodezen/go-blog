## Introduction

Before playing this game, I had been studying one of Seo Bong Soo's games from [Master Play: The Fighting Styles of Kato Masao and Seo Bong Soo](http://www.bengozen.com/book-review-fighting-styles-kato-masao-seo-bong-soo/ "Book Review: The Fighting Styles of Kato Masao and Seo Bong Soo"). And as I was replaying his game against Otake Hideo, I couldn't help but wonder whether or not I had been wrong about my style of go this entire time. After all, I always thought I had a fighting style; but perhaps that is not really the case.

Anyways, inspired by his game, I decided to try and imitate that same feeling in this game. And though I end up collapsing in on myself with a really basic reading mistake, I hope you'll still find this game entertaining.

no,Category,Good,Bad
1,Opening,Overall it felt okay considering it was a non-traditional opening; but nothing spectacular.,**Move 28: **This may have been too slow. Giving Black the initiative on the lower left was rough.
2,Middle Game,It felt more or less in my favor; but a bit risky.,Black got a big left side which sort of forced me to try and kill his group.
3,Fighting,**Move 38:** I was proud of starting this fight since I had an advantage in this area.,**Move 98:** This is probably my losing move. Letting my stones get weakened like that was bad.
4,Endgame,Not Applicable,Not Applicable
5,Overall Reading,**Move 74-97:** Felt proud for being able to continually harass this group / almost killing it.,**Move 106:** No excuses for this move. Complete misread.
