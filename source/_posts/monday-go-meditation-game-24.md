summary:
	<p>For today's go meditation, you will be able to witness a rather rare occurrence in my games: territorial style! In this game, I try to focus on playing solid moves that focus on taking profit as opposed to killing. Though a few of my moves are rather slow and I make a rather dumb mistake at the very end, I think you'll find this game an interesting change of pace from my typical moyo games. Enjoy!</p>

## One Point Lesson

When an opponent is making overplays and trying to live in your sphere of influence, be very careful not to be overconfident and accidentally give your opponent the forcing moves needed to live.

_Update: Many thanks to frederic for pointing out that I outread myself at the end. Black's descent to T4 is self-atari and I completely missed it. XD_
