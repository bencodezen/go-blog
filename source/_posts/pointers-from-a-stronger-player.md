So I had the pleasant surprise of having Justin watch over one of my games tonight.  It's always funny how obvious the mistakes I make are when a stronger player points them out... or more obvious moves.  But he did leave me with an interesting thought...

"As a word of advice, just do problems.  Focus on the fundamentals.  Everything else will come later."

I think that may be where my training is a bit lacking at this point.  I keep reading more theory type books, but have neglected my problems.  Looks like I'm going to switch gears starting October.  SDK (Single Digit Kyu) may be out of reach by this point, but we'll set a new target when my second month is up.
