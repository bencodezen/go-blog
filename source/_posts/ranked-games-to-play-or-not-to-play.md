That is the question.

I've been fortunate enough to make some incredible friends since my return to go, and I was quite surprised to find that many were curious about when I would finally play a ranked game again.

To start, I'm shocked that I didn't try to play a ranked game the moment the clock struck midnight on New Years Eve. Yet, more than three days later, I'm sitting here with three free games under my belt and not a ranked game in sight. So the question is, what am I waiting for?

In all honesty, I think part of me is torn between returning to ranked games and continuing my study method for an additional month. On one hand, I'm really curious how much growth I've undergone since my [ranked game sabbatical in December](http://www.bengozen.com/ranked-games-retreat/ "Ranked Games Retreat"). On the other hand, I'm thinking that it might be more exciting to continue as I have and see where I am in another month! xD After all, I need to get as strong as I can possibly get before the [North American Go Convention](http://www.bengozen.com/north-american-go-convention/ "North American Go Convention!!!")!!!

And the other thing that I have to remember is that I am getting thrashed on Tygem and WBaduk at 6k or below, so in actuality, I might not have grown as much as I am hoping I did. So for now, looks I'm going to continue sticking to league games and continuing my training!
