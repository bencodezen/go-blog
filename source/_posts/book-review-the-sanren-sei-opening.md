### Detailed Review

#### Readability - 8 / 10

As someone who has read perused his fair share of books regarding the opening and fuseki theory, I found The Power of the Star Point to be extremely refreshing due to its focus on a single opening concept. While the overall language is relatively light and easy to understand, the material itself can be quite dense at times. On the other hand, what else do you expect from a book focused solely on the sanrensei?

#### Content Quality - 9 / 10

Fantastic coverage on a topic that many amateur players could really benefit from. Even though I "read" the book once, there is still a lot that went over my head and I'm sure that I will have more to gain the next time I read it. It was great to have him explain the different joseki's and how they were either beneficial or detrimental to the sanrensei concept. Fantastic book that deserves 5 stars for the coverage of a topic that deserves the proper attention.

### Conclusion

The Power of the Star Point is a magnificent insight into the opening, handicap go, and whole board thinking all in one shot. It is definitely the book that gave me my breakthrough in understanding moyo formation, whole board thinking, and star point power in a whole new way. This is definitely a book you don't want to miss out on if you have the opportunity to read it.
