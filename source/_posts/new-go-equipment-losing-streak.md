![GoGameGuru Order](/images/2013/11/gogamegurustuff.jpg)

My [GoGameGuru](http://shop.gogameguru.com) order came in!!! Woot woot!!! You can see everything I got in the picture (except the glass stones which are inside the bowls). There is so much to write about and review. Haha. However, since I do need a little bit of time to put the reviews together, the one thing I want to recommend right away is the [Foldable Go Board](http://shop.gogameguru.com/folding-go-board/?acc=e4da3b7fbbce2345d7772b0674a318d5). The quality is incredible for the price and it's definitely my favorite item of my entire order. So if you're in the market for a foldable go board, don't wait!

On a more journalistic note, I've been on a losing streak lately. Interestingly enough however, I'm actually okay with it. The training to try and maintain zen in high pressure situations or even after losing has been tough; but I think it's been doing me some good. In fact, I was even able to resign a game that I was winning (against a 5 kyu) since I had more pressing matters to attend to. And if you're wondering why I think it's an accomplishment, it's because I never would have been able to do that in the past. I would have saw the game as rightfully mine to win and probably have been unable to walk away from it.

As one might expect, my rank has been dropping left and right; but surprisingly enough, I'm actually okay with it. I'm not worried about whether or not the server thinks I'm stronger or not. I am taking on my weaknesses head on. It might make me lose a stone or two for now, but I think the benefit I will gain from this approach will be worth it. =)
