For my debut back in the ASR League, I am slightly embarrassed to report that my return to the stage was far less than spectacular. It's not so much that I played terribly, it's just that I ended up fighting out a ko battle that was very good for my opponent.

To illustrate it a little more clearly for those who don't have time to go through the game, it was a ko battle for my group's connectivity while his group was perfectly alive. In the words of Janice Kim, it was a "picnic ko battle" for him.

What did I think I was doing? I thought I was threatening to kill the lower right group...

**Ben's Go Fundamental Rule #894 - Make sure that the group you're trying to kill actually can be killed and doesn't already have two eyes...**

For higher level players, I know that getting cut off would've been bad news for black either way and this ko battle was probably necessary... but that wasn't what I intended, so it's still a red mark in my books.

Did I mention that I seem to be a SDK now?

For shame... for shame...
