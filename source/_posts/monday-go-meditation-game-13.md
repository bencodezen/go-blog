## Introduction

When it comes to handicap games, I think a majority of players would agree with me that it is far more scary to play White than to play Black. With that being said, I thought it would only be appropriate that I started showcasing some of my games as White in handicap games. So, without further adieu, let us start with the easiest handicap game (but still terrifying) you can play as White: a two-stone handicap.

## **One Point Lesson**

**When playing White in handicap go, creating a ****complicated game through light stones and probes will serve you well.**

_Many thanks to my friend Paul for letting me use our games for review!_
