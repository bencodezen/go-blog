## Introduction

I recently had a conversation regarding the importance of ladders. And while the topic of ladders will probably cause many people to roll their eyes at the topic time and time again, it's simply one of those things that you keep having a deeper and deeper respect for as you dive into the abyss of go. Today's game is short, but it illustrates the severity of not being able to perfectly read out a ladder.

So whether you like it or not, you need to make your peace with ladders and make them your best friend. It's the only way to climb to the top!

### Game Summary

no,Category,Good,Bad
1,Opening, **Move 10** - I'm proud of experimenting with a new joseki move I learned., **Move 34** - This seems questionable to me; but perhaps it was a necessary defense.
2,Middle Game, **Move 36** - The sequence around here worked out really well in my favor., **Move 52** - This was rather small in regards to the whole board.
3,Fighting, **Move 48** - My confidence in believing I could figure out the upper right corner was a good sign of healthy kiai., "**Move 54** - Though I was successful locally, this was small in regards to the whole board."
4,Endgame, Not Applicable, Not Applicable
5,Overall Reading, **Move 74** - Being able to confidently read out this ladder was awesome., **Move 58** - The sequence around here didn't quite work out the way I expected. Didn't realize I needed a ladder to be able to really gain a foothold in this area.
