I know that it's been over a week since I came back from Hong Kong, so first off, I apologize that I haven't been able to post about Hong Kong yet.

When I got back, I thought that I would be able to just grab my photos and quickly organize them in an hour or so. And then after I did that, I would be able to start working on my posts. After all, it's only about a week's worth of pictures right?

Yeah... Let's just say I completely forgot and therefore underestimated the amount of effort it takes to properly organize your photos (and that doesn't even count editing, cropping, resizing, etc.). There were the duplicates, the variations on a shot that I had to choose through, and then renaming them properly so I can easily track what is what...

So while I thought I would be able to knock it out quickly so I could get started on drafting my Hong Kong trip posts, it'll probably be at least another week before I'm able to get them up and online. Because in the end, I'm not trying to just throw up posts for the sake of posting. I'm really trying to capture the experience as best I can in order to give you the most enjoyable reading experience possible, so I hope you can bear with me a bit longer.

On a separate but related note, I am also starting to feel the twinge of anxiety as I'm starting to fall slightly my weekly posts. As I've been trying to improve the quality of the game reviews, they've also started to take a considerable amount of time. But don't worry, I'm working hard to make sure that I don't fall behind. Back to work I go!
