This past weekend I had the pleasure of attending the NOVA Pumpkin Classic Tournament and seeing many friends there. And though I originally planned on playing in the tournament that day, I ended up being on call for work and thus planned on only attending to see friends and show my support.

Upon arrival though, I got convinced to play in the first round since we had even numbers. And while I would have liked to have played for more rounds, it was simply not possible for me to do so with a possible work call coming at any moment.

On the upside, I did get to play a round against an opponent I had played against in the Baduk Open Championship. I had decided to self-promote to 1k this time and was giving her a 2 stone handicap. The following is the game record (which I will be sure to review in a future Monday Go Meditation).

Though I am a little sad I was not able to stay for the whole day, it was great being able to see everyone. An especially big shoutout goes to the Stafford Go community: Robbie, Anderson, and Ramon for being there and sharing a great lunch with me.

Other than that, I’ve been adhering to my training schedule without fail thus far. And though I had some initial plans for ramping up content production here on the blog, it’ll have to wait a bit as I am in the process of sorting through things. No worries though, you can still expect to see the usual here. Just don’t expect any new weekly columns in the near future. Haha.

With that said, for all those who celebrate Halloween, wishing you all a spectacular Halloween full of fun and candy!
