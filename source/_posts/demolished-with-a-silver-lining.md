Last night I played a fun game against my friend Nate, but was definitely demolished by the end of the game. A 40 point loss... hahaha. Thought I admit that there was definitely a degree of disappointment in myself for playing so terribly, there is a silver lining in my complete failure.

So my experiment failed miserably, but I am sure that the experience I gained with be valuable in the future. In addition, I am happy knowing that my mistakes were not reading mistakes this time around. Though I may have made plenty of strategic and whole board errors, reducing the number of reading mistakes should prove to be very lethal once I take care of my flawed strategies. For those wondering about the kifu, it'll be featured on a Monday Go Meditation in a couple of weeks.

Meanwhile, I have also decided to take my sensei's advice and take the time to really watch [Battousai's](http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCYMY6j5mUvPMPzvN5bxuKA) [3D Tygem Series](http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLv8NkgCbtGytYtHKchRMLh9l2KVlqW1z6). Perhaps I can follow in his footsteps and gain sudden insight into the game through watching the series. Not sure how it will go, but I'll be sure to let you know if anything changes.
