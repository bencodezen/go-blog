**What's the best aspect about this product?**

*   The orchid engraving on the lids!
**What is the weakest aspect of this product?**

*   Can't really say that there's anything weak about the product, but I would say I might have preferred kitani style bowls with the engraving. Just a personal preference though. xD
**Is it durable?**

*   Seems like it would hold up to normal usage, but I would be wary of letting it topple off of a high shelf onto cement floor.
**Bottom Line**

1.  Beautiful and gorgeous bowls that will comfortably hold any standard size go stones.
2.  The orchard engraving is a great touch that really helps to give it a nice touch.
3.  Totally worth it for those who want a bit of art along with their go bowl.

A beautiful set of rosewood orchid-engraved bowls that would hold my size 36 glass stones perfectly!

As my first artistic go bowl set, I was really excited when it finally came in the mail.

When I opened the box, I was really pleased to see that it was packaged really well so that nothing would be damaged in transit. A+ for their packing job!

[caption id="attachment_4458" align="aligncenter" width="360"][![orchidbowls05](http://www.bengozen.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/orchidbowls05.jpg)](http://www.bengozen.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/orchidbowls05.jpg) Here are the bottom of the bowls. Though the right one has a streak, it's just part of the wood coloring and not due to damaging. I think it adds character. =D[/caption]

[caption id="attachment_4459" align="aligncenter" width="360"][![orchidbowls06](http://www.bengozen.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/orchidbowls06.jpg)](http://www.bengozen.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/orchidbowls06.jpg) And here are the bowls filled with my size 36 glass stones! Woot![/caption]

At the end of the day, they do the job they were intended to do: hold go stones. =) They just do it with a bit of flair since they have the orchid engraving. Haha. But if you have any interest in owning bowls like this, I would highly recommend them!
