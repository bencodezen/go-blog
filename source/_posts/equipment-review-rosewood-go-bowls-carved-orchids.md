### Synopsis

**What's the best aspect about this product?**

*   The orchid engraving on the lids!

**What is the weakest aspect of this product?**

*   Can't really say that there's anything weak about the product, but I would say I might have preferred kitani style bowls with the engraving. Just a personal preference though. xD

**Is it durable?**

*   Seems like it would hold up to normal usage, but I would be wary of letting it topple off of a high shelf onto cement floor.

**Bottom Line**

1.  Beautiful and gorgeous bowls that will comfortably hold any standard size go stones.
2.  The orchard engraving is a great touch that really helps to give it a nice touch.
3.  Totally worth it for those who want a bit of art along with their go bowl.

### What I Was Hoping For

A beautiful set of rosewood orchid-engraved bowls that would hold my size 36 glass stones perfectly!

### My Review

As my first artistic go bowl set, I was really excited when it finally came in the mail.

![Here it is. Ahhh.. Can't wait to see what's inside!](/images/2014/01/orchidbowls01.jpg)

![Isn't that beautiful? Man...](/images/2014/01/orchidbowls02.jpg)

When I opened the box, I was really pleased to see that it was packaged really well so that nothing would be damaged in transit. A+ for their packing job!

![When you open it up, you can see they have the standard packaging beads to prevent any weird odors.](/images/2014/01/orchidbowls04.jpg)

![Here are the bottom of the bowls. Though the right one has a streak, it's just part of the wood coloring and not due to damaging. I think it adds character. =D](/images/2014/01/orchidbowls05.jpg)

![And here are the bowls filled with my size 36 glass stones! Woot!](/images/2014/01/orchidbowls06.jpg)

At the end of the day, they do the job they were intended to do: hold go stones. =) They just do it with a bit of flair since they have the orchid engraving. Haha. But if you have any interest in owning bowls like this, I would highly recommend them!
