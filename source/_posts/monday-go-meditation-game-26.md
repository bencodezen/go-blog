## Introduction

For today's go meditation, I will be reviewing a game I played recently with fellow go tweeter goBum! Though we have known each other for quite a while now, I'm surprised it's taken us so long to finally play a game with one another. =D Nonetheless, I'm glad we were finally able to do so and you can see the game below along with some insight that I received from a dan player who gave us a review afterwards. There are quite a few moments where I made abysmal moves that are shameful and vulgar, but it was a fun game and I definitely learned quite a bit from it. Many thanks to goBum for letting me use the kifu and I hope I can give you a better game next time![

## **One Point Lesson**

** When an opponent's group has become monstrously large, trying to kill it is often unreasonable (no matter how heavy it may seem).**
