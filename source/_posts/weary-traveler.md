Lately, I've noticed that I can't seem to get my head in the game. Each move feels more lackluster than the last, and I seem to consistently find myself in do or die situations. I don't know if it's because I'm tired, or whether I'm actually starting to burn out.

With each move I play, it's as if I'm watching a ghost of myself play each move. The tenacity and energy that was once a big part of my game seems to be missing. Unlike other times, there is no obstacle in my way this time. Instead, it is like I am a weary traveler who has succeeded in one part of his journey; but as he stares out at the long road ahead, he can only sit down in bewilderment as he wonders how he will summon the energy necessary to continue onwards.

Taking a break is not an option for me. That is something I know for sure, but figuring out how I will continue from here will certainly be a challenge.
