### Detailed Review

#### Readability - 8 / 10

From this point on, the problems enter an advanced level and leaves behind the simpler problems we became familiar with in Volume 1 and Volume 2\. As a result, some of the solutions will be harder to understand and the variations may not necessarily cover the answer you came up with. This is to be expected however, seeing as how we are progressing towards the land of SDK's (i.e., single digit kyus).

#### Content Quality - 9 / 10

This volume has a much greater emphasis on life and death and middle game tactics. While I was a little sad to see fewer subjects than the previous volumes, I recognize that the next level of growth for players lies in the middle game. The problems still are top notch and will be very valuable to those players who can understand the lessons they are trying to pass on.

While the cover states that the book is appropriate for 20 kyu to 15 kyu players, if you can do all the problems in these book, you are most likely going to be in the 12 kyu to 8 kyu range.
