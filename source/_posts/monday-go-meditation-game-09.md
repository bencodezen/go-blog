## Introduction

I decided to return back to my [Tygem 5d Experiment](http://www.bengozen.com/the-style-gap/ "The StyleÂ Gap") since I have not felt in the mood to play full live games yet. Games on this server tend to be shorter and not to mention I am always aware that I'm pretty much guaranteed to lose. The following game is one that I think is rather interesting since you get to see how high dan players handle having a good framework and how they go about dismantling mine. Enjoy!

## **One Point Lesson**

**Don't let yourself get surrounded by enemy stones, especially when your opponent is much stronger than you.**
