summary:
	<p>I decided to return back to my <a href="/2013/01/20/the-style-gap/">Tygem 5d Experiment</a> since I have not felt in the mood to play full live games yet. Games on this server tend to be shorter and not to mention I am always aware that I'm pretty much guaranteed to lose. The following game is one that I think is rather interesting since you get to see how high dan players handle having a good framework and how they go about dismantling mine. Enjoy!</p>
