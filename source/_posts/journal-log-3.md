Hope everyone has had a restful Labor Day Weekend.  Mine has been filled with 21st birthdays and craziness, but it's time to get back to Go!

So over the last few days I've tried to play some games online, but I just can't bring myself to complete any of them.  I end up resigning halfway for some reason.  I'm not sure whether it's just cause I'm just itching to be playing with a real goban and stones, or what.... It's putting me in a weird funk and I'm not sure what to do.  sigh....

Need to do something about this....
