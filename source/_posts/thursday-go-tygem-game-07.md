## Introduction

After my third game in Yunguseng Dojang, I became a lot more comfortable playing White. Maybe it's because I've started to really appreciate having komi. Either way, I'm glad to have broken away from my fear of playing White.

This game was the first one I played after being dispelled of that anxiety of playing White. And believe it or not, it was actually a rather calm game where no dramatic battles of life and death occurred. See for yourself below!

### Game Summary

no,Category,Good,Bad
1,Opening,**Move 30** - Using the knight’s move to gain sente from the 3-3 invasion was a big reason why I could get an advantage this game., Surprisingly I cannot find any fault with my opening. Please let me know if you spot something I missed!
2,Middle Game,"Overall it was quite peaceful and neither played created any big weak groups, but I managed to take more territory overall.", N/A
3,Fighting,"To my surprise, there wasn’t much fighting in this game.”, N/A
4,Endgame,**Move 164-175** - I was proud to find this sequence that reduced a lot of Black’s points in sente., Hard to find any big flaws in my endgame. It seemed I was stronger than my opponent in this area.
5,Overall Reading,**Move 100** - Finding this preparatory move for the resulting sequence was a big step forward for me.,Move 52 - I completely missed the double atari when I played here. Shame on me.
6,Strategy,**Move 78** - Realizing that it would be difficult to continue severely attacking the Black group and simply cashing in on territory is a move I used to find it impossible to do.,"**Move 52** - Even if we assume this move works, there wasn’t much strategic value here since White did not have great potential in the center nor a weak group to attack."
