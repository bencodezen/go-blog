So I've started reading my go books again, and I did not realize how poorly I've been playing lately. As a result, I'm taking a break from online games (once again) because I've only been reinforcing really poor playing habits.

At first I was troubled as to why I was still a DDK, but it does not surprise me any longer. It's time for me to undergo some serious training.

Go ability transformation here I come!

_UPDATE:Â So I noticed I tend to get overly frustrated and then determine to take a "sabbatical" only to find myself playing again the next day. Thus, scratch that idea, it's just time to play better._
