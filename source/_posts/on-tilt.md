So I'm unbelievably busy with grad school work now, but that didn't stop me from trying to play today. I have a ten page paper to finish by 7:00pm, and I played go... I know.... Anyhow, I lost my first game due to failing to defend a single point. Unfortunately, with all the stress, lack of sleep, and urgency of other things that I need to do, I went on tilt and could not regain composure. Against my better judgment, I went ahead and played another game after that. No good either. Two resignations. Ugh...

The lesson of the day is simple. It's just like Yuan Zhou told me, "When you play Go, you don't want to have other distractions or other tasks eagerly waiting your attention." And I definitely think that all this school stuff definitely impacted the quality of my games. sigh. It was two games... need to just move on.

Make that three losses... this is just an awful streak. I'm being outfought in every battle... absolutely pathetic...
