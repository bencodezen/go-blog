Happy new years everyone! 2013 has come and gone and 2014 is now upon us! And though I'm one that comes from the philosophy of living each day to the fullest and not waiting till the beginning of the year to start change, I thought it wouldn't hurt to do a little new years resolution for the blog!

**New Year Resolution #1\. Change the hosting service that I am using.**

For all those who have experienced times when the blog have gone down, I sincerely apologize for the fact that my hosting site has been absolutely terrible. I am growing tired of their frequent outages and will definitely be looking for a change in hosting service. You cannot believe how many times I tried to login to write posts or prepare material only to find that my server was down. Bleh. So if you have any recommendations, please be sure to pass them on.

**New Year Resolution #2\. Write at least one post every week.**

As some of you are aware, there have been a number of times where I try to take on way more than I can (healthily) handle. As a result, I've burnt out and gone through more down points than I'd care to admit. So instead of trying to accomplish a goal that might lend itself to another crash and burnout, I'm hoping to simply stick to being disciplined and working consistently rather than short bursts.

**New Year Resolution #3\. Give the blog a brand new design.**

This one is definitely a bit ambitious; but since it's the beginning of the year, I think that this is something that will be more feasible as time goes on. Although I have tried my best to make the experience of my blog as user friendly and pleasant as possible, I know that it falls short in a number of areas and can use a big overhaul. So if there's going to be one resolution that is going to be a grand overture, might as well let it be this one. =D

And though I could probably go on, I think that the key to making 2014 successful is to have broader goals that feed into the grand vision. The smaller goals (i.e., do 100 tsumego problems a day) are ones that will come and go as I progress through 2014, so we'll get to those as they come. So with that, here's to our first step in 2014\. Onwards!
