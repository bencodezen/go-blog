## Friday Go Forward: Week 36

## Overview

This week has been a continuation of trying to really dig deep when it comes to being consistent about maximizing my quality of training in a set amount of time. There has been a couple of days where I ended up slacking off, but I feel like it's been good progress and that it should get better over time. I will admit that I do miss playing live games, but I know that it has been unrealistic of me to do so since it really consumes a lot of time whenever I do. So as of late, I have decided to increase my activity on [Nova.gs](http://www.nova.gs)* in order to ensure that I don't get rusty. I hope that more of you will join me over there so that we can play more games!

*And just in case anyone is wondering, [Nova.gs](http://www.nova.gs) allows you to play both live games in real time along with correspondence games. It's pretty sweet!

## Games

*   KGS -  1 game
*   DGS - 3 ongoing games
*   Nova -  6 games (3 finished : 3 ongoing)

## Training Menu

*   20 minutes of Reading Training (i.e., Life &amp; Death, Tesuji, etc.)
