;W[fc]WL[1178.137]
;B[hc]BL[1185.975]C[Locally ok. Globally bad since too many low stones.]
;W[cf]WL[1159.293]
;B[ee]BL[1181.482]C[Slow and doesn't make use of G17.]
;W[ci]WL[1143.242]C[White should dive into C17.]
;B[jq]BL[1162.457]C[Black should protect C17 here.]
;W[cn]WL[1138.349]
;B[co]BL[1147.109]C[The kick is awful here since it's not doing anything. The kick should only be used in certain circumstances and this was not one of them. Should've played at C8 or something.]
;W[dn]WL[1134.475]
;B[gp]BL[1136.919]C[This looks nice and symmetrical, but it sucks. It doesn't really help either stone, and leaves bad aji. The bottom left territory is not even close to mine since the 3rd row is still invadable. ]
;W[mq]WL[1116.09]
;B[oq]BL[1123.905]C[This is good. Not a kick. Protect the corner.

UPDATE: This does not protect the corner. Black still needs an additional move at R6 to really call it "his" corner.]
;W[qn]WL[1109.384]
;B[qj]BL[1109.94]C[This was good.]
;W[qq]WL[1102.496]C[This is a bad move for white.

UPDATE: There's nothing wrong with this move.]

;B[pn]BL[1048.249]C[This move is super slow, not necessary. Should've tenuki.

UPDATE: This move is "slow," but it prevents aji such as white running out.]
;W[eq]WL[1058.969]C[Here's the invasion....]
;B[ep]BL[1041.628]
;W[fq]WL[1056.798]
;B[fp]BL[1038.781]C[All this is good, I chose to give up the corner for outside influence.]
;W[cq]WL[1038.752]
;B[dq]BL[1031.11]C[This is inconsistent with my plan to simply get outside influence. It's even worse because I push on a connection and don't cut afterwards.]

;B[gr]BL[999.853]C[Review: End result. I forced him to make eye shape and thus removed any bad aji I may have been able to use later. Conclusion? I'm an idiot.]

;W[kc]WL[900.379]
;B[ge]BL[936.772]C[I think this was just awful.. I'm overly concentrated for one single stone. And I'm essentially like... hey L17... please jump out into the center.]

;W[sd]WL[724.242]
;B[qg]BL[764.352]C[Again trading stones for thickness...]
;W[qe]WL[722.194]
;B[kd]BL[759.879]
;W[jj]WL[691.328]C[So I thought this was interesting. I was sure he was going to cut at R13.... probably too small.]
;B[fn]BL[739.651]C[Since he thought it was small, I went along and played points I thought might be bigger. This might be slow though.]

;W[ql]WL[512.922]
;B[pm]BL[670.325]C[I felt like he wanted me to play Q7... I played a more solid connection instead. He could've live anyway.]
;W[nl]WL[506.378]
;B[mj]BL[652.988]C[So I chose this move to reduce. I thought about M9, but didn't now how I'd get out of it.]

;B[jd]BL[191.569]
;W[ic]WL[62.812]
