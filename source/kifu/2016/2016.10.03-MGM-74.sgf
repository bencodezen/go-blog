;B[qd]BL[599.599]C[Komoku with potential emphasizing the right side. Noted.]
;W[dd]WL[589.418]C[Since this game is shorter, I chose the star-point since it's the most flexible and the one I'm most familiar with.

In addition, because I have komi, I'm not worried about a cross-fuseki game and typically invite Black to play it if he desires.]
;B[pq]BL[599.125]C[Alternating komoku. ]
;W[dp]WL[585.772]C[Ninrensei it is then. Let's see how the computer wants to play!]
;B[oc]BL[598.861]LB[fq:A]C[I expected an approach at A (F3), but the corner enclosure works as well!]
;W[po]WL[581.914]C[The one space high approach is my most comfortable one for 3-4, so again, familiarity is of the essence in these faster paced games.]
;B[qo]BL[598.59]LB[pp:A]C[I debated descending at A (Q4).]
;W[qn]WL[578.297]C[But preferred simplicity in this game.]
;B[qp]BL[598.221]C[Black pulls back to prevent White from easily settling.]
;W[pm]WL[577.276]C[The tiger mouth variation seemed preferrable in this case since the extension would be helpful against Black's shimari in the upper right.]
;B[nq]BL[597.962]C[Black jumps to finish his formation.]
;W[qi]WL[574.255]C[And I end the joseki with this extension which could prove helpful later on.]
;B[cf]BL[597.725]C[Black's approach here is probably fine, but it did feel a little odd from a direction of play standpoint. Then again, if Black is aiming for a territorial game, it's probably fine.]
;W[fc]WL[571.448]C[Small knight's move to keep things simple.]
;B[ic]BL[597.493]C[This surprised me and I thought for a while as to how to deal with it.]
;W[ch]WL[560.488]LB[ce:A]C[I decided to go ahead and pincer the C14 stone, but I'm not sure it's really the best move. Perhaps the kick at A (C15) instead?]
;B[ef]BL[596.247]C[Black jumps.]
;W[bd]WL[535.076]LB[ce:A]C[So I defend the corner now, but part of me still thinks that the kick at A (C15) would have been the better option.]
;B[di]BL[594.938]C[Now Black gets to counter-attack.]
;W[ci]WL[529.58]C[Extend.]
;B[dj]BL[593.581]C[Black extends to stay ahead.]
;W[ck]WL[527.912]C[So I jump since I don't want to be pushing from behind.]
;B[fq]BL[592.241]C[Tenuki? That's surprising yet again.]
;W[dn]WL[521.551]LB[dk:A]C[I decide to use the one-space high jump since I'm thinking I can get A (D9) later on.]
;B[dr]BL[590.989]C[Black slides to start establishing a base.]
;W[cq]WL[517.564]C[I defend the corner.]
;B[hp]BL[589.769]C[And then Black plays the knight's move which was unexpected to me at the time, but it seems to actually work quite well with O3 in the lower right.]
;W[dh]WL[515.447]C[With sente, now I'm going to attack Black's weak connection.]
;B[eh]BL[588.527]C[Black hanes to try and connect.]
;W[dk]WL[507.699]C[Before cutting though, I decided to take this key point in Black's shape in order to expand my territory on the left.]
;B[cj]BL[587.259]C[Black threatens to sever White apart.]
;W[bj]WL[501.581]C[So I naturally block.]
;B[bk]BL[586.035]LB[bi:A]TR[ch][dh][ci]C[Black cuts here and threatens the double cut at A (B11) in order to capture the marked stones (C12).]
;W[ai]WL[491.152]LB[bk:A]C[So I protect the cut since I'm confident I can capture A (B9).]
;B[ek]BL[584.785]C[This hane is now rather painful unfortunately. Not a variation I had really considered.]
;W[el]WL[478.596]C[In order to prevent D9 from becoming a wasted move, I had to hane here.]
;B[fk]BL[583.378]C[Black extends.]
;W[eg]WL[474.43]C[So I seize the opportunity to wedge and continue cutting Black apart.]
;B[fg]BL[582.107]C[Black blocks and ataris.]
;W[ei]WL[466.992]LB[dg:A]C[This double atari seems small and incorrect in hindsight. I really should have connect at A (D13) and let Black decide what he wanted.

In my defense though, at the time I though I would gain access to the center and separate Black into two different groups.]
;B[fh]BL[580.784]C[Black connects to my surprise.]
;W[dg]WL[462.634]LB[df:A][ej:B]C[I decide to change course and threaten to follow up with A (D14), but I'm thinking that simply capruing at B (E10) may be more than sufficient.]
;B[ej]BL[579.535]C[Well Black chooses to keep his group connected. Smart.]
;W[df]WL[458.343]C[I go ahead and take my profit on the left now, but I do feel like this is inferior to me getting access to the center.]
;B[ee]BL[578.344]C[Black extends.]
;W[ed]WL[454.883]C[I block to further solidify my corner.]
;B[de]BL[577.106]C[Black threatens to connect rescue his stone which would wipe out most of the territory I would have in this area.]
;W[ce]WL[452.169]C[So I have to block.]
;B[be]BL[575.783]C[Black ataris here and I'm a little nervous that my stones are in trouble.]
;W[cd]WL[449.326]C[But after connecting and looking it over, I'm confident that I should be okay.]
;B[gd]BL[574.538]C[Black seals me from the center.]
;W[fl]WL[417.361]LB[qf:A][lp:B]C[In hindsight, these seems rather slow. It doesn't do much for me as far as territory. The only real benefit I have is that I prevent a sente turn by Black. I think either of the options would have been much better.]
;B[gk]BL[573.303]C[Black extends to maintain shape since an atari here would be disadvantageous to Black.]
;W[qf]WL[390.681]LB[qg:A]C[Two space extension here to prevent the easy approahc from Black at A (R13) and also helps to stabilize my right side more.]
;B[oe]BL[572.058]C[Black strengthens his corner, but this does seem a bit slack.]
;W[pc]WL[377.809]C[Since Black is strong in the corner, I attached here to try and figure out what Black had in mind as far as priorities. And to be honest, this was more of an intuition move that was relying on my ability to make sabaki. I did not read out a lot of variations when I attached here.]
;B[pd]BL[570.83]C[Black blocks me from cutting.]
;W[ob]WL[376.273]C[So I hane to see how Black responds.]
;B[pb]BL[569.576]C[Black cuts as expected.]
;W[nc]WL[374.1]C[So I just calmly spin around with an atari.]
;B[qc]BL[568.33]C[Black captures.]
;W[kc]WL[368.865]C[So now I can do a two space extension with the full expectation of playing lightly in order to gain a stable group in Black's area.]
;B[nd]BL[567.108]C[Black makes good shape while continuing to put pressure on my group.]
;W[mc]WL[366.185]LB[ke:A]C[I debated jumping at A (L15) but decided to extend since I believed I could establish a small base to help me make life later.]
;B[pg]BL[565.644]C[Black threatens to slice through my group.]
;W[qg]WL[362.473]C[i decide to keep my stones connected since I believe I can manage at the top.]
;B[ph]BL[564.45]LB[qh:A]C[Black extends which threatens to exploit the weakness at A (R12).]
;W[pi]WL[337.565]LB[qk:A]C[I noticed I've been playing this block lately since I'm thinking I can defend the weakness while developing the area around A (R9); but I have to say that this shape has gotten me in trouble more than a few times now. So I'm a little skeptical of how good this move is.]
;B[oi]BL[563.168]C[This hane hurts....]
;W[oj]WL[335.43]C[I hane as well thinking I'm doing okay since I'm building territory on the right.]
;B[ni]BL[561.986]C[Black extends to make good shape.]
;W[ib]WL[322.009]C[At this point I know that jumping out in the center is going to a near impossible task to make life, so I attach in hopes of making some shape and establishing at least one eye.]
;B[hb]BL[560.7]C[Black blocks on the outside.]
;W[jb]WL[316.348]LB[hc:A]C[So I calmly extend while threatening a cut at A (H17) and feel pretty good about my shape.]
;B[hc]BL[559.406]C[Black protects the cut.]
;W[ke]WL[310.163]LB[na:A]C[I debated securing life with A (O19), but it felt too passive, so I jumped.]
;B[nb]BL[558.127]C[Black thinks I made a mistake and ataris immediately.]
;W[mb]WL[308.139]C[I counter-atari.]
;B[oa]BL[556.879]C[Black captures.]
;W[kg]WL[293.079]C[Since I couldn't make life with a single move, I jumps again in preparation to try and exercise some sabaki to hopefully make a second eye.]
;B[nj]BL[555.722]LB[qh:C][pj:B][ok:A]C[Black turns here which threatens weaknesses at A (P9), B (Q10), and C (R12) and once again reminds me that the initial move of Q11 was probably bad.]
;W[ok]WL[288.438]LB[if:A][mf:B]C[I decide to extend in order to solidify my territory on the right, but this is questionable. I really should be considering moves like A (J14) or B (N14) to start making life for my group.]
;B[ig]BL[554.586]C[Black starts to harrass my group.]
;W[if]WL[279.335]C[I attach to start making some kind of shape.]
;B[hf]BL[553.427]C[Black hanes.]
;W[ie]WL[277.706]LB[jg:A]C[So I extend here thinking Black would probably play A (K13) to remove my eye.]
;B[fd]BL[552.192]C[But Black actually secures the connection between his stones instead (which is something I've been pretty poor at doing recently).]
;W[jg]WL[261.048]C[So I go ahead and take the key point to secure life for my group.]
;B[ih]BL[551.045]C[Black extends to prevent the atari.]
;W[qh]WL[255.159]LB[gb:B][jq:A]C[I connect here because I'm worried about getting cut apart, but upon seeing this in hindsight, I'm pretty appalled at my decision. There are much bigger moves like A (K3) or B (G18).]
;B[mn]BL[549.817]C[Now Black's center moyo is starting to look pretty good.]
;W[hn]WL[245.054]C[So I try to jump in from the other side.]
;B[gm]BL[548.604]C[Black pokes at my connection.]
;W[fo]WL[239.305]C[So I try to respond in a more flexible way.]
;B[gl]BL[547.38]C[But it's looking a bit grim.]
;W[fn]WL[231.608]LB[hn:A]C[I extend here to try and further solidify my left territory, but this leaves my reduction move at A (H6) to fend for itself. Not too good...]
;B[gn]BL[546.271]C[Black slices through as expected.]
;W[go]WL[222.458]C[I threaten to connect.]
;B[ho]BL[545.151]C[Black finishes severing the connection.]
;W[ml]WL[208.711]C[So now I jump in from the other side thinking I should be able to decimate Black's moyo.]
;B[on]BL[544.061]C[Black peeps.]
;W[pn]WL[204.057]C[I connect since Black's bottom territory is already large enough as it is.]
;B[oo]BL[542.9]C[Black descends to prevent me from any easy reduction moves.]
;W[kl]WL[187.712]LB[jq:A]C[One space jump to further reduce Black's moyo, but on reflection, this seems too weak. Something needs to be done about the bottom area. It seems a little late for an invasion at like A (K3), but the fact that I'm thinking this now means I probably should have played there at an earlier time.]
;B[lk]BL[541.713]C[Black peeps.]
;W[ll]WL[177.05]C[I connect.]
;B[nk]BL[540.626]C[Black threatens to separate White.]
;W[nl]WL[174.592]C[So I extend to stay connected.]
;B[om]BL[539.552]C[Black threatens to cut again.]
;W[ol]WL[172.676]C[I connect solidly.]
;B[kn]BL[538.484]C[Black happily jumps and secures 6th line territory... Ouch...]
;W[pp]WL[157.192]C[I figured I would take this move to reduce in sente.]
;B[qq]BL[537.167]C[Black defends the weakness.]
;W[op]WL[150.336]C[So I get to push a little more.]
;B[np]BL[536.049]C[Black blocks.]
;W[oq]WL[148.329]C[And once more for good measure...]
;B[or]BL[534.951]C[Black blocks. And now the question is, where do I go from here? While I certainly didn't know it at the time I was playing, Black is in the lead at the moment.]
;W[il]WL[134.905]LB[ng:A]TR[ib][jb][mb][kc][mc][nc][ie][ke][if][jg][kg]C[I'm thinking of continuing to reduce Black's center moyo here while threatening to save the H6 stone, but this seems to be from the wrong direction. I should honestly be considering moves like A (O13) which would simultaneously help strengthen my marked group.]
;B[im]BL[533.833]C[Black tries to keep the stones separated.]
;W[jm]WL[130.046]C[So I first make the tiger's mouth and threaten to push through.]
(;B[jn]BL[532.772]LB[in:A]C[Black blocks, but Black certainly could have descended at A (J6) to capture my H6 stone and only deal with a reduction on the bottom. The reason Black doesn't do that however, it most likely because it gives White sente. See variation if you don't know what I'm talking about.]
;W[hm]WL[125.043]C[At the time, I'm simply happy to save my stone. Very small way of thinking though...]
;B[in]BL[531.72]C[Black connects while putting my stones in atari.]
;W[hl]WL[123.757]C[I connect.]
;B[jk]BL[530.54]C[But now Black has the initiative and I'm defending in gote. Ouch.]
;W[jl]WL[120.879]C[I connect.]
;B[bl]BL[529.386]C[Black's extension here gave me pause for concern for a moment.]
;W[cm]WL[113.861]C[But It seemed like I was okay, so keeping it simple!]
;B[cr]BL[528.276]C[Ouch... This was big. ]
;W[gb]WL[74.532]C[To my surprise now, I ignored it, but I think the reason I did was because I felt like Black would just get all the big endgame points otherwise.

I liked this move since it protected my corner territory while threatening to link up my two groups.]
;B[ha]BL[527.231]TR[ib][jb][mb][kc][mc][nc][ie][ke][if][jg][kg]C[Black descends and to be honest, at this point, my first priority should probably be securing my marked group. All kinds of funny business can happen when your opponent has a stone on the first line.]
;W[rn]WL[34.875]LB[ro:A]C[Alas, I take a risk and continue trying to focus on taking big endgame points. Now this is definitely inferior to playing at A (S5) instead, but I wanted sente.]
;B[ro]BL[526.176]C[Black blocks.]
;W[re]WL[29.127]C[And then I take this point since it's pretty big as far as endgame goes.]
;B[br]BL[525.056]C[Black now takes advantage of my tenuki now.]
;W[bq]WL[27.127]C[This time I have to block since otherwise I'll lose pretty much all of my erritory here.]
;B[aq]BL[524.021]C[Oh the double sente hane... it hurts so much...]
;W[ap]WL[25.506]C[Block.]
;B[ar]BL[522.807]C[Connects.]
;W[bo]WL[24.28]C[And I must defend in gote... so much sadness...]
;B[mf]BL[521.645]C[With this move, White should be feeling a bit of pressure.]
;W[he]WL[1.241]C[I'm pretty sure I'm okay so I just keep reducing Black's territory]
;B[ge]BL[520.573]C[Black blocks.]
;W[eq]WL[30]OW[5]C[While I think about what I want to do up top, this move is pretty threatening since it would destroy a lot of Black's territory / capture Black stones.]
;B[er]BL[519.518]C[So Black blocks.]
;W[fp]WL[30]OW[5]LB[gq:A]C[Now I threaten to atari at A (G3).]
;B[dq]BL[518.27]C[Black ataris first.]
;W[ep]WL[30]OW[5]C[So I connect.]
;B[gq]BL[517.265]C[And then Black extends to prevent the atari.]
;W[kj]WL[30]OW[5]C[I'm still feeling safe at the top, so I try this move to further reduce Black's territory.]
;B[kk]BL[516.243]C[Black connects.]
;W[ji]WL[30]OW[5]C[And so play the diagonal to ensure my stones are connected.]
;B[jh]BL[515.256]C[Black pushes through and threatens to cut.]
;W[kh]WL[30]OW[5]C[So I turn and keep my stones connected.]
;B[ii]BL[514.266]C[Black extends.]
;W[mk]WL[30]OW[5]C[And I'm sensing weakness in the shapes now, so I push through thinking I can exploit a few things.]
;B[lj]BL[513.29]C[Black turns to my surprise.]
;W[mj]WL[30]OW[5]C[So I keep pushing through.]
;B[li]BL[512.188]C[Black extends.]
;W[mi]WL[30]OW[5]C[I push again.]
;B[mh]BL[511.163]C[Black blocks.]
;W[ij]WL[30]OW[4]LB[hg:A]C[I hane here to aim at the weakness at A (H13).]
;B[ik]BL[510.066]C[Black extends.]
;W[hk]WL[30]OW[4]C[So I push to block and threaten to put Black in a snapback situation.]
;B[hj]BL[509.05]C[Black blocks and ataris.]
;W[ki]WL[30]OW[4]LB[jj:A]C[I connect here thinking that Black will capture at A (K10).]
;B[lh]BL[508.044]C[To my surprise Black connects instead.]
;W[jj]WL[30]OW[4]LB[hg:A][nh:C][hi:B]C[So I happily connect because now Black has the issue of A (H13, B (H11), and C (O12).]
;B[jd]BL[506.879]C[When Black peeps here, I'm completely oblivious to the fact that my group is about to get cut.]
;W[nh]WL[30]OW[4]C[And so I atari here happily thinking that I'll be okay since White has all those weaknesses.]
;B[kd]BL[505.912]C[Black makes good on his threat.]
;W[ld]WL[30]OW[4]C[I block, but it hasn't fully dawned on me just how dire the situation is.]
;B[lf]BL[504.888]C[With this move, I'm now in a lot of trouble. My groups cannot connect anymore.]
;W[ng]WL[30]OW[4]TR[ni][oi][nj][nk]C[I have no idea what I was thinking here. I think this was a move made out of desperation. It secures the capture of Black's marked stones, but it does not help my group whatsoever...]
;B[le]BL[503.848]C[Black cuts.]
;W[hi]WL[30]OW[4]C[So I atari here thinking I'm going to be alright.]
;B[gj]BL[502.819]C[Black connects to prevent my stones from connecting.]
;W[hg]WL[30]OW[4]C[And then I make the mistake of atari here. This could also be considered a losing move as well as I did not even bother to consider whether this would be enough to live.]
;B[gf]BL[501.791]C[Black connects and I realize that I can't make two eyes.]
;W[hh]WL[30]OW[4]C[I don't have enough time to verify this, but I see a chance to start a capturing race and know it's my last chance. However, it's worth noting that directly capturing here probably wasn't the smartest move if I'm not mistaken. Black was already captured and what I should have done is actually start the semeai sequence that you'll see in four moves.]
;B[ih]BL[500.664]C[Black takes the critical point.]
;W[je]WL[30]OW[3]C[I threaten to make another eye while removing one of Black's liberties.]
;B[kf]BL[499.619]C[Black pokes out the eye.]
;W[fi]WL[30]OW[3]C[So I embark on reducing Black to one eye by threatening to save this stone.]
;B[gi]BL[498.566]C[Black blocks.]
;W[ff]WL[30]OW[3]C[Throw-in here to prepare to falsify the eye.]
;B[fe]BL[497.509]C[Black captures.]
;W[gg]WL[30]OW[3]C[I falsify the eye.]
;B[hd]BL[496.451]C[Black reduces my liberty.]
;W[ga]WL[30]OW[3]C[I reduce Black's liberties.]
;B[id]BL[495.387]C[Black reduces another one of my liberties.]
;W[gc]WL[30]OW[3]C[I return the favor.]
;B[ig]BL[494.355]C[Black ataris from the inside.]
;W[jf]WL[30]OW[3]C[So I have to connect.]
;B[lg]BL[493.342]C[Black seals off the last of my liberties and I'm screwed.]
;W[ia]WL[30]OW[3]C[I go ahead and play out the semeai since it allows me to seal off some territory in sente, but man I'm feeling pretty crappy at the moment.]
;B[ff]BL[492.343]C[Black connects to prevent a shortage of liberty situation.]
;W[jc]WL[30]OW[3]C[I atari.]
;B[gh]BL[491.399]C[Black connects.]
;W[ka]WL[30]OW[3]C[And now I make life on top.]
;B[md]BL[490.474]C[Black ataris.]
;W[lc]WL[30]OW[3]LB[pf:A]C[I respond here pretty immediately, but it's actually a really small move and on reflection, the final losing move. I should absolutely have played A (Q14) at this point which would have been worth a LOT more points.]
;B[pf]BL[489.466]C[When Black plays here, I completely goof here.]
;W[sb]WL[30]OW[3]C[And I jump in here thinking it's a big endgame move. ]
;B[oh]BL[488.601]TR[ng][nh]C[Except now my marked stones are dead and Black just saved four stones and gained a bunch of points in the center. I literally just gave Black his moyo back and then some. Nice job Ben...]
;W[nn]WL[30]OW[3]C[This move is questionable. I jump in here thinking I'll be able to reduce in sente which will be worth the single stone sacrifice, but this ends up being a mistake as you'll see shortly.]
;B[nm]BL[487.687]C[Black cuts as expected.]
;W[mm]WL[30]OW[3]C[I atari.]
;B[no]BL[486.788]C[Black captures.]
;W[ln]WL[30]OW[3]C[And then I threaten to push though.]
;B[lo]BL[485.829]C[And Black blocks.]
;W[lm]WL[30]OW[3]C[And then I end up connecting in gote anyways. So I just threw away a stone for no reason...]
;B[sn]BL[484.816]C[Black takes this huge endgame move since it's sente.]
;W[sm]WL[30]OW[3]C[I have to block.]
;B[so]BL[483.934]C[Black connects.]
;W[rl]WL[30]OW[3]C[And now I have to defend the cut.]
;B[cl]BL[483.059]C[Black ataris here for some reason...]
;W[dl]WL[30]OW[3]C[I connect.]
;B[fm]BL[482.197]C[Black threatens to push through.]
;W[em]WL[30]OW[3]TR[ha][hb][hc][ic][fd][gd][hd][id][jd][kd][de][ee][fe][ge][ef][ff][gf][hf][fg][eh][fh][gh][di][gi][cj][dj][ej][gj][hj][ek][fk][gk][gl][fm][gm][gn]C[I block knowing that Black has to respond since Black's marked group is in atari.]
;B[ii]BL[481.276]C[Black does not make a mistake and makes a clean capture.]
;W[rd]WL[30]OW[3]C[I try to salvage as much endgame as I possibly can.]
;B[rc]BL[480.424]C[Black blocks and threatens to cut.]
;W[sc]WL[30]OW[3]C[I extend to connect.]
;B[lr]BL[479.535]C[Black then jumps down here to play this move for some reason. I'm pretty sure there's little to no threat there at this moment.]
;W[rb]WL[30]OW[3]C[So I continue reducing Black's territory here.]
;B[qa]BL[478.571]C[Black finally defends this area.]
;W[qe]WL[30]OW[3]LB[sd:A][pe:B][of:C]C[I then connect here to prevent any sente nonsense with throw-ins at A (T16) later while also planning to play B (Q15) in sente since it threatens C (P14).]
;B[pe]BL[477.731]C[Black defends against the follow-up.]
;W[gp]WL[30]OW[3]LB[hq:A][lr:B]C[I play here thinking that there's a weakness at A (H3), but honestly I don't think there really is because of Black's move at B (M2) earlier.]
;B[hq]BL[476.906]C[But Black defends anyway.]
;W[ra]WL[30]OW[3]C[I make two points here with this move.]
;B[qb]BL[476.021]C[Black defends.]
;W[km]WL[30]OW[3]LB[ma:B][ko:A]C[This is dame and I have no idea what I was thinking. A (L5) is not a threat in the least bit. B (N19) is so much bigger since it's actually worth something.

The woes of not using my time properly...]
;B[jp]BL[475.121]C[Black defends anyways. Again.]
;W[ma]WL[30]OW[3]C[Lucky for me I get this point then.]
;B[nf]BL[474.265]C[Not sure what Black is thinking there...]
;W[na]WL[30]OW[3]C[I threaten to start a ko.]
;B[jh]BL[473.397]C[Black goes ahead and captures.]
;W[ob]WL[30]OW[3]C[So I take the ko.]
;B[mg]BL[472.405]LB[pj:A]C[Black just connects here which is completely unnecesssary. Easy ko threat would have been A (Q10), but then again, Black is already aware of the outcome of the game while I'm naiively unaware.]
;W[pa]WL[30]OW[3]C[I take the second ko thinking I'm trying to grab every half point I can get.]
;B[fj]BL[471.553]C[Black continues to ignore since it doesn't matter.]
;W[oa]WL[30]OW[3]C[So I connect hoping that it has made some sort of difference.]
;B[og]BL[470.723]C[Black captures yet again.]

(;B[in]C[Black could certainly have played here.]
;W[jn]C[I would push once.]
;B[jo]LB[jj:A]C[Black can still block in good shape, but now White has the initiative as far as playing moves like A (K10).]))
