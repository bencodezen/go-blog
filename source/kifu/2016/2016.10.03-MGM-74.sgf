;B[qd]BL[599.599]C[Komoku with potential emphasizing the right side. Noted.]
;W[dd]WL[589.418]C[Since this game is shorter, I chose the star-point since it's the most flexible and the one I'm most familiar with.

In addition, because I have komi, I'm not worried about a cross-fuseki game and typically invite Black to play it if he desires.]
;B[pq]BL[599.125]C[Alternating komoku. ]
;W[dp]WL[585.772]C[Ninrensei it is then. Let's see how the computer wants to play!]
;B[oc]BL[598.861]LB[fq:A]C[I expected an approach at A (F3), but the corner enclosure works as well!]
;W[po]WL[581.914]C[The one space high approach is my most comfortable one for 3-4, so again, familiarity is of the essence in these faster paced games.]
;B[qo]BL[598.59]LB[pp:A]C[I debated descending at A (Q4).]
;W[qn]WL[578.297]C[But preferred simplicity in this game.]
;B[qp]BL[598.221]C[Black pulls back to prevent White from easily settling.]
;W[pm]WL[577.276]C[The tiger mouth variation seemed preferrable in this case since the extension would be helpful against Black's shimari in the upper right.]
;B[nq]BL[597.962]C[Black jumps to finish his formation.]
;W[qi]WL[574.255]C[And I end the joseki with this extension which could prove helpful later on.]
;B[cf]BL[597.725]C[Black's approach here is probably fine, but it did feel a little odd from a direction of play standpoint. Then again, if Black is aiming for a territorial game, it's probably fine.]
;W[fc]WL[571.448]C[Small knight's move to keep things simple.]
;B[ic]BL[597.493]C[This surprised me and I thought for a while as to how to deal with it.]
;W[ch]WL[560.488]LB[ce:A]C[I decided to go ahead and pincer the C14 stone, but I'm not sure it's really the best move. Perhaps the kick at A (C15) instead?]
;B[ef]BL[596.247]C[Black jumps.]
;W[bd]WL[535.076]LB[ce:A]C[So I defend the corner now, but part of me still thinks that the kick at A (C15) would have been the better option.]
;B[di]BL[594.938]C[Now Black gets to counter-attack.]
;W[ci]WL[529.58]C[Extend.]
;B[dj]BL[593.581]C[Black extends to stay ahead.]
;W[ck]WL[527.912]C[So I jump since I don't want to be pushing from behind.]
;B[fq]BL[592.241]C[Tenuki? That's surprising yet again.]
;W[dn]WL[521.551]LB[dk:A]C[I decide to use the one-space high jump since I'm thinking I can get A (D9) later on.]
;B[dr]BL[590.989]C[Black slides to start establishing a base.]
;W[cq]WL[517.564]C[I defend the corner.]
;B[hp]BL[589.769]C[And then Black plays the knight's move which was unexpected to me at the time, but it seems to actually work quite well with O3 in the lower right.]
;W[dh]WL[515.447]C[With sente, now I'm going to attack Black's weak connection.]
;B[eh]BL[588.527]C[Black hanes to try and connect.]
;W[dk]WL[507.699]C[Before cutting though, I decided to take this key point in Black's shape in order to expand my territory on the left.]
;B[cj]BL[587.259]C[Black threatens to sever White apart.]
;W[bj]WL[501.581]C[So I naturally block.]
;B[bk]BL[586.035]LB[bi:A]TR[ch][dh][ci]C[Black cuts here and threatens the double cut at A (B11) in order to capture the marked stones (C12).]
;W[ai]WL[491.152]LB[bk:A]C[So I protect the cut since I'm confident I can capture A (B9).]
;B[ek]BL[584.785]C[This hane is now rather painful unfortunately. Not a variation I had really considered.]
;W[el]WL[478.596]C[In order to prevent D9 from becoming a wasted move, I had to hane here.]
;B[fk]BL[583.378]C[Black extends.]
;W[eg]WL[474.43]C[So I seize the opportunity to wedge and continue cutting Black apart.]
;B[fg]BL[582.107]C[Black blocks and ataris.]
;W[ei]WL[466.992]LB[dg:A]C[This double atari seems small and incorrect in hindsight. I really should have connect at A (D13) and let Black decide what he wanted. 

In my defense though, at the time I though I would gain access to the center and separate Black into two different groups.]
;B[fh]BL[580.784]C[Black connects to my surprise.]
;W[dg]WL[462.634]LB[df:A][ej:B]C[I decide to change course and threaten to follow up with A (D14), but I'm thinking that simply capruing at B (E10) may be more than sufficient.]
;B[ej]BL[579.535]C[Well Black chooses to keep his group connected. Smart.]
;W[df]WL[458.343]C[I go ahead and take my profit on the left now, but I do feel like this is inferior to me getting access to the center.]
;B[ee]BL[578.344]C[Black extends.]
;W[ed]WL[454.883]C[I block to further solidify my corner.]
;B[de]BL[577.106]C[Black threatens to connect rescue his stone which would wipe out most of the territory I would have in this area.]
;W[ce]WL[452.169]C[So I have to block.]
;B[be]BL[575.783]C[Black ataris here and I'm a little nervous that my stones are in trouble.]
;W[cd]WL[449.326]C[But after connecting and looking it over, I'm confident that I should be okay.]
;B[gd]BL[574.538]C[Black seals me from the center.]
;W[fl]WL[417.361]LB[qf:A][lp:B]C[In hindsight, these seems rather slow. It doesn't do much for me as far as territory. The only real benefit I have is that I prevent a sente turn by Black. I think either of the options would have been much better.]
;B[gk]BL[573.303]C[Black extends to maintain shape since an atari here would be disadvantageous to Black.]
;W[qf]WL[390.681]LB[qg:A]C[Two space extension here to prevent the easy approahc from Black at A (R13) and also helps to stabilize my right side more.]
;B[oe]BL[572.058]C[Black strengthens his corner, but this does seem a bit slack.]
;W[pc]WL[377.809]C[Since Black is strong in the corner, I attached here to try and figure out what Black had in mind as far as priorities. And to be honest, this was more of an intuition move that was relying on my ability to make sabaki. I did not read out a lot of variations when I attached here.]
;B[pd]BL[570.83]C[Black blocks me from cutting.]
;W[ob]WL[376.273]C[So I hane to see how Black responds.]
;B[pb]BL[569.576]C[Black cuts as expected.]
;W[nc]WL[374.1]C[So I just calmly spin around with an atari.]
;B[qc]BL[568.33]C[Black captures.]
;W[kc]WL[368.865]C[So now I can do a two space extension with the full expectation of playing lightly in order to gain a stable group in Black's area.]
;B[nd]BL[567.108]C[Black makes good shape while continuing to put pressure on my group.]
;W[mc]WL[366.185]LB[ke:A]C[I debated jumping at A (L15) but decided to extend since I believed I could establish a small base to help me make life later.]
;B[pg]BL[565.644]C[Black threatens to slice through my group.]
;W[qg]WL[362.473]C[i decide to keep my stones connected since I believe I can manage at the top.]
;B[ph]BL[564.45]LB[qh:A]C[Black extends which threatens to exploit the weakness at A (R12).]
;W[pi]WL[337.565]LB[qk:A]C[I noticed I've been playing this block lately since I'm thinking I can defend the weakness while developing the area around A (R9); but I have to say that this shape has gotten me in trouble more than a few times now. So I'm a little skeptical of how good this move is.]
;B[oi]BL[563.168]C[This hane hurts....]
;W[oj]WL[335.43]C[I hane as well thinking I'm doing okay since I'm building territory on the right.]
;B[ni]BL[561.986]C[Black extends to make good shape.]
;W[ib]WL[322.009]C[At this point I know that jumping out in the center is going to a near impossible task to make life, so I attach in hopes of making some shape and establishing at least one eye.]
;B[hb]BL[560.7]C[Black blocks on the outside.]
;W[jb]WL[316.348]LB[hc:A]C[So I calmly extend while threatening a cut at A (H17) and feel pretty good about my shape.]
;B[hc]BL[559.406]C[Black protects the cut.]
;W[ke]WL[310.163]LB[na:A]C[I debated securing life with A (O19), but it felt too passive, so I jumped.]
;B[nb]BL[558.127]C[Black thinks I made a mistake and ataris immediately.]
;W[mb]WL[308.139]C[I counter-atari.]
;B[oa]BL[556.879]C[Black captures.]
;W[kg]WL[293.079]C[Since I couldn't make life with a single move, I jumps again in preparation to try and exercise some sabaki to hopefully make a second eye.]
;B[nj]BL[555.722]LB[qh:C][pj:B][ok:A]C[Black turns here which threatens weaknesses at A (P9), B (Q10), and C (R12) and once again reminds me that the initial move of Q11 was probably bad.]
;W[ok]WL[288.438]LB[if:A][mf:B]C[I decide to extend in order to solidify my territory on the right, but this is questionable. I really should be considering moves like A (J14) or B (N14) to start making life for my group.]
;B[ig]BL[554.586]C[Black starts to harrass my group.]
;W[if]WL[279.335]C[I attach to start making some kind of shape.]
;B[hf]BL[553.427]C[Black hanes.]
;W[ie]WL[277.706]LB[jg:A]C[So I extend here thinking Black would probably play A (K13) to remove my eye.]
;B[fd]BL[552.192]C[But Black actually secures the connection between his stones instead (which is something I've been pretty poor at doing recently).]
;W[jg]WL[261.048]C[So I go ahead and take the key point to secure life for my group.]
;B[ih]BL[551.045]C[Black extends to prevent the atari.]
;W[qh]WL[255.159]LB[gb:B][jq:A]C[I connect here because I'm worried about getting cut apart, but upon seeing this in hindsight, I'm pretty appalled at my decision. There are much bigger moves like A (K3) or B (G18).]
;B[mn]BL[549.817]C[Now Black's center moyo is starting to look pretty good.]
;W[hn]WL[245.054]C[So I try to jump in from the other side.]
;B[gm]BL[548.604]C[Black pokes at my connection.]
;W[fo]WL[239.305]C[So I try to respond in a more flexible way.]
;B[gl]BL[547.38]C[But it's looking a bit grim.]
;W[fn]WL[231.608]LB[hn:A]C[I extend here to try and further solidify my left territory, but this leaves my reduction move at A (H6) to fend for itself. Not too good...]
;B[gn]BL[546.271]C[Black slices through as expected.]
;W[go]WL[222.458]C[I threaten to connect.]
;B[ho]BL[545.151]C[Black finishes severing the connection.]
;W[ml]WL[208.711]C[So now I jump in from the other side thinking I should be able to decimate Black's moyo.]

;W[sb]WL[30]OW[3]C[And I jump in here thinking it's a big endgame move. ]
;B[oh]BL[488.601]TR[ng][nh]C[Except now my marked stones are dead and Black just saved four stones. Nice job Ben...]
;W[nn]WL[30]OW[3]C[This move is questionable. I jump in here thinking I'll be able to reduce in sente which will be worth the single stone sacrifice, but this ends up being a mistake as you'll see shortly.]

;W[sm]WL[30]OW[3]C[I have to block.]

;B[ii]BL[481.276]C[Black does not make a mistake and makes a clean capture.]
;W[rd]WL[30]OW[3]C[I try to salvage as much endgame as I possibly can.]
;B[rc]BL[480.424]C[Black blocks and threatens to cut.]
;W[sc]WL[30]OW[3]C[I extend to connect.]
;B[lr]BL[479.535]C[Black then jumps down here to play this move for some reason. I'm pretty sure there's little to no threat there at this moment.]
;W[rb]WL[30]OW[3]C[So I continue reducing Black's territory here.]
;B[qa]BL[478.571]C[Black finally defends this area.]
;W[qe]WL[30]OW[3]LB[sd:A][pe:B][of:C]C[I then connect here to prevent any sente nonsense with throw-ins at A (T16) later while also planning to play B (Q15) in sente since it threatens C (P14).]
;B[pe]BL[477.731]C[Black defends against the follow-up.]
;W[gp]WL[30]OW[3]LB[hq:A][lr:B]C[I play here thinking that there's a weakness at A (H3), but honestly I don't think there really is because of Black's move at B (M2) earlier.]
;B[hq]BL[476.906]C[But Black defends anyway.]
;W[ra]WL[30]OW[3]C[I make two points here with this move.]
;B[qb]BL[476.021]C[Black defends.]
;W[km]WL[30]OW[3]LB[ma:B][ko:A]C[This is dame and I have no idea what I was thinking. A (L5) is not a threat in the least bit. B (N19) is so much bigger since it's actually worth something.

The woes of not using my time properly...]
;B[jp]BL[475.121]C[Black defends anyways. Again.]
;W[ma]WL[30]OW[3]C[Lucky for me I get this point then.]
;B[nf]BL[474.265]C[Not sure what Black is thinking there...]
;W[na]WL[30]OW[3]C[I threaten to start a ko.]
;B[jh]BL[473.397]C[Black goes ahead and captures.]
;W[ob]WL[30]OW[3]C[So I take the ko.]
;B[mg]BL[472.405]LB[pj:A]C[Black just connects here which is completely unnecesssary. Easy ko threat would have been A (Q10), but then again, Black is already aware of the outcome of the game while I'm naiively unaware.]
;W[pa]WL[30]OW[3]C[I take the second ko thinking I'm trying to grab every half point I can get.]
;B[fj]BL[471.553]C[Black continues to ignore since it doesn't matter.]
;W[oa]WL[30]OW[3]C[So I connect hoping that it has made some sort of difference.]
