;B[pd]BL[1774.257]C[Being as this is my first live game against a person in a long time, I thought I'd keep it simple. And for me, it doesn't get much simpler than star point, which allows me to be very flexible while also being the position that I probably know the most joseki for so I can respond appropriately.]
;W[dc]WL[1796.088]C[3-4 with the strong side facing my hoshi. Noted.]
;B[qp]BL[1768.883]C[It's been awhile since I'ved played, and the last place I left off with fuseki involved using the micro-Chinese quite extensively. So this 3-4 was a way for me to keep it as simple as possible since this was just the begining.]
;W[dp]WL[1768.584]C[Star point. Great! Looks like I'll get to start setting up the micro-Chinese!]
;B[fq]BL[1763.784]C[Since I've been gone for awhile, I'm not abreast of the latest and greatest with fuseki, so I wondered whether White would do something differently or not.]
;W[cn]WL[1745.843]C[Calm response. Okay. I know my next move!]
;B[lq]BL[1754.971]C[Micro-Chinese fuseki setup complete!]
;W[nc]WL[1720.444]LB[pf:A][qf:B]C[Approaching at the top. I considered A (Q14) and B (R14) for some time since I wanted to hopefully get a double-winged enclosure in the lower right.]
;B[pf]BL[1739.65]LB[pj:A]C[I decide to go with the one-space jump since I felt it would have better synergy with A (Q10) if I got the chance to play it later.]
;W[ce]WL[1703.155]LB[oc:A][jd:C][nd:B]C[This tenuki took me completely by surprise. How refreshing! 

Now the only question was whether I needed to take advantage of White's tenuki immediately or not. I debated the kick sequence starting with A (P17) for a while...]
;B[pj]BL[1674.095]C[But I felt that would be rushed and this was a better framework for me anyhow. ]
;W[qc]WL[1647.755]LB[jd:A][qd:B]C[I was expecting A (K16) at this time since it looks like a possible moyo game, but 3-3 invasion it is!]
;B[pc]BL[1642.049]LB[qd:A]C[For a brief moment, I debated playing A (R16) instead since I wanted to develop the right side, but then I remembered that that rule really applies in the one space low pincer joseki, so I went ahead and extended once.]
;W[pb]WL[1618.31]C[White hanes to connect and gain shape.]
;B[qd]BL[1630.197]C[I now can block the right side.]
;W[rb]WL[1610.002]C[White correctly makes proper shape as per the joseki.]
;B[rc]BL[1617.182]C[I atari as a forcing move to close off any easy entry into the right side.]
;W[qb]WL[1589.93]LB[jd:A][dj:B][fo:C][op:D]C[The joseki ends with White connecting or else foreit the corner and right side for a complete loss in this area.

But now I have sente, and I looked around the board trying to debate what I should do. ]
;B[ic]BL[1556.208]LB[dj:A][fo:B][op:C]C[I decided to split the top area since it would give me a miai for settling with a two-space extension. The rest of the areas seemed like good moves, but I wasn't interested in focusing solely on growing my moyo. After all, the lower right side might look like Blacks, but it would have been a big mistake to think that. Flexibility was the main goal for me here, and this seemed like a good way to prevent White from turning it into a moyo game.]
;W[rd]WL[1516.505]C[I was surprised to get this cut so early.]
;B[re]BL[1542.817]TR[ic]C[But on second thought, it occurred to me that White most likely wanted to settle the group before embarking on an attack on the marked stone (J17).]
;W[iq]WL[1500.71]C[White tenukis again! Man was I impressed to see White's willingness to explore the many possibilities around the board and not simply follow the opponent. ]
;B[lo]BL[1505.236]LB[fo:B][cq:A]TR[fq]C[This move was inspired from Game 1 of the Jubango between Gu-Li and Lee-Sedol in that I wanted to treat the marked stone (F3) lightly and simultaneously develop the lower right. 

After all, the way I saw it was that I had a miai for responses in the event White wanted to attack the stone severely.]
;W[fc]WL[1475.746]LB[kc:A]C[This would probably be the first move I would call a mistake for White. When attacking a stone, the proverb to typically follow is "Push your opponent towards your strong areas." In this case, White already has a corner enclosure here, so it would actually be better to attack with a move like A (L17) since it would for Black into a two space extension toward the corner which would strengthen White while making Black feel a little cramped.]
;B[lc]BL[1492.822]C[Once Black plays here, you can see that White's group it all of a sudden looking a bit weaker.]
;W[gn]WL[1453.472]LB[eq:A]TR[fq]C[White seems to be attacking the marked stone (F3) from a distance. And I strongly debated ignoring this attack, but I felt that White getting A (E3) as well would lead White to have a pretty big piece of territory on the lower left.]
;B[cq]BL[1466.892]C[So I went ahead and dove in the corner.]
;W[dq]WL[1439.468]C[White descends to separate Black's stones.]
;B[dr]BL[1453.066]C[Black threatens to connect.]
;W[er]WL[1426.36]C[White blocks.]
;B[cr]BL[1439.758]LB[bo:A][eq:B]C[Black connects with A (B5) and B (E3) as viable options.]
;W[eq]WL[1385.981]C[White correctly prevent Black from connecting the stones together.]
;B[bo]BL[1428.099]LB[bn:A]C[Black slides to extend the group's base and ensure it doesn't die. 

White next move is technically a mistake as far as the joseki goes, so click on A (B6) to see the typical continuation of this sequence.]
(;W[cp]WL[1368.073]C[White pushes here which seems like the natural move since typically you want to reduce your opponent's eyespace / territory.]
;B[bp]BL[1416.746]LB[bn:A][co:B]C[Black naturally will black, but the difference here is that Black's shape is pretty much settled at this point while White still has some weaknesses around A (B6) and B (C5).]
;W[bq]WL[1358.126]C[I was a little puzzled when White cuts here, but I saw it as an opportunity to test my reading abilities and choose the best variation.]
;B[aq]BL[1398.137]LB[br:A]C[I chose the atari from this direction since an atari at A (B2) seemed to leave more aji than I'd be comfortable with as far as eye-space and shape was concerned.]
;W[ie]WL[1338.689]LB[bn:A]C[I was a little surprised that White would leave A (B6) unsealed, but I was very pleased to see White take the initiative with this attack.]
;B[le]BL[1382.58]LB[sd:A]TR[pb][qb][rb][nc][qc]C[I debated capturing at A (T16) in order to weaken the marked group, but felt that it was important not to let White seal in my stones.]
;W[sc]WL[1319.696]C[It's almost like White read my mind. Haha. Bravo to White for ensuring the group's life did not come into question.

So my next thought was, where should I move next?]
;B[cj]BL[1300.654]LB[kd:A][op:B]C[I debated trying to come up with a way to defend against the peep at A (L16) or maybe further solidify my lower right corner with B (P4), but in the end, I felt that I needed to do something about White's immense potential on the left.]
;W[ck]WL[1300.645]C[I was definitely not expecting White to attach in order to attack me. And I debated for a while in terms of whether I should hane below or above...]
;B[dk]BL[1208.563]LB[bk:A]C[Even though the hane at A (B9) was much simpler for me to read and felt safe, I wanted to embrace the potential complication of hane'ing over the stone and trying to manage as best as I could. ]
;W[cl]WL[1280.311]LB[dj:A]C[White calmly extended. Much respect for that since a cut at A (D10) would have made my life a lot easier as far as making sabaki (i.e. eye shape).]
;B[cg]BL[1173.364]LB[dj:A]C[I did debate trying to defend the cut at A (D10) somehow, but honest I felt it would make my group very heavy and give White something to attack while gaining profit. So I decided to play light and keep my focus on playing a flexible game.]
;W[dj]WL[1261.704]C[White cuts as expected, and now I'm like... So I wanted to be flexbile... but I don't know how to exactly deal with this...]
;B[ci]BL[1043.06]LB[di:A]C[I debated the atari at A (D11) but ended up extended since I felt it was a simple move that did not inadvertently strengthen White while giving me a heavy group to deal with.]
;W[dh]WL[1239.494]LB[ch:B][di:A]C[White's jump here was unexpected, but I liked that it challenged me to try and be creative with my response. After all, a move like A (D11) or B (12) would leave me with a heavy group.]
;B[be]BL[970.848]C[So I decided to keep with the notion of playing light and being flexible. Since White was already strong in the corner, I wasn't hurting myself much by using this attachment as a probe and potential ally for a possible upcoming fight for my life.]
;W[di]WL[1218.491]LB[ch:A]C[Whte's connection here is solid and almost instinctively causes me to want to connect at A (C12) since I don't want to get cut apart.]
;B[cd]BL[941.953]C[But then I reminded myself once again of my goal to play light and to be flexible. And since White ignored me in the corner, I'm happy to start making some shape here!]
;W[cf]WL[1198.836]C[White bumps here and threatens to separate Black's stones.]
;B[bf]BL[927.842]C[So I naturally extend to keep connected.]
;W[dg]WL[1174.189]C[White extends to seal Black in and strengthen White's influence in the center.]
;B[ch]BL[884.51]TR[dk]C[I debated tenuki at this point, but it seemed like it would allow White to settle too easily while also sacrificing stones for no reason. And by connecting now, it gives me the possibility of using the marked stone (D9) later.]
;W[dd]WL[1156.805]C[White seals Black in.]
;B[cc]BL[859.957]C[So now I need to extend to at least take more corner territory in exchange for White's influence.]
;W[bd]WL[1139.374]LB[bc:A]C[When White cuts here, I was worried for a second that there were shape deficiences I wasn't aware of. I couldn't find any, so my next concern was how to handle the cut. The first instinct was to securely atari the stone with A (B17).]
;B[cb]BL[839.75]C[But I realize that the extension here was more effective.]
;W[bg]WL[1118.251]C[White cutting again made me think I might have missed something.]
;B[ag]BL[826.574]C[It didn't seem to be anything drastic, but i decided to atari from this side in order to maximize my eye potential here in the event any capturing race occurred.]
;W[ah]WL[1088.976]C[Did I miss something?]
;B[bh]BL[815.106]C[Seems safe to just capture.]
;W[qm]WL[1082.984]LB[kj:A]C[White's invasion here seems deep. A move like A (L10) seems liks it could be a good way to expand White's moyo while reducing Black's; but I can understand White's desire to invade since Black is ahead on territory at the moment.]
;B[pn]BL[785.868]C[I debated multiple ways of attacking White. I ended up deciding on this shoulder hit in order to put maximum pressure on White.]
;W[qn]WL[1066.641]LB[po:A]C[White's extension here gave me pause as far as the best response. I almost decide to simply pull back at A (Q5).]
;B[qo]BL[763.079]C[But I decided to bump directly in order to remove one of White's liberties.]
;W[ph]WL[1051.447]LB[qn:A]C[I liked White's tenuki here since it showed flexibility in White's strategy, but it probably would have been best if White did not exchange A (R6) first since White created a rather heavy group as a result.]
;B[qj]BL[721.407]C[The iron pillar seemed to be the best response since I wanted to keep White separated.]
;W[ne]WL[1032.422]C[White's jump was timed well since it started to separate Black's groups as well.]
;B[nf]BL[687.597]C[I had to try to connect.]
;W[mf]WL[1014.735]C[White hanes.]
;B[me]BL[668.451]LB[of:A]C[I cut and expect an atari at A (P14).]
;W[ng]WL[998.606]C[White ataris from the other side however.]
;B[of]BL[655.699]C[So I naturally connect.]
;W[pm]WL[980.857]LB[nd:A]C[And when White tenukis, I'm stronly considering the atari at A (O16) to connect my stones solidly.]
;B[on]BL[642.733]C[However, I felt obliged to respond here since I felt I was solidifying a lot of corner territory.]
;W[om]WL[965.703]C[White continues to extend.]
;B[nn]BL[630.125]C[I didn't want White to hit the head of two stones, so I extended once more.]
;W[oi]WL[947.398]C[White's kosumi here reminds me that my iron pillar is far from safe.]
;B[rh]BL[587.731]C[So it was time to connect underneath.]
;W[oj]WL[933.529]C[White fully seals off my stones from the center.]
;B[kg]BL[497.27]LB[nd:A]C[So I decide to jump in immediately here; but to be honest, I really should have play A (O16) at this point in order to secure my stones.]
;W[nm]WL[913.644]LB[mn:A]C[When White extends here, I have a feeling that the aim is to play A (N6).]
;B[km]BL[442.871]LB[mn:A]C[So I decided on this knight move in order to further reduce White's potential in the center while prevent the hane at A (N6) from being too much of a nuisance.]
;W[mg]WL[894.804]C[When White connects here, I am still very focused on the center.]
;B[ig]BL[395.785]LB[nd:A]C[So I use the simple one point jump here even though I could potentially get separated. The reality is that I really needed to play A (O16) at this point.]
;W[qg]WL[871.197]C[When White pokes here, I had read that White cannot cut...]
;B[rf]BL[332.188]C[I extend to stay connected.]
;W[rg]WL[855.277]C[White threatens to separate Black.]
;B[sg]BL[309.75]C[I connect under.]
;W[nd]WL[837.908]C[But now the problem becomes apparent: (1) my stones have been officially separated and (2) my group is actually very close to dying. ]
;B[qh]BL[281.32]LB[pg:A]C[After thinking for some time, I come up with this extension that threaten th cut at A (Q13) while expanding my eye space.]
;W[pg]WL[822.803]C[White connects.]
;B[qf]BL[268.116]C[So I make my eye in gote since I don't foresee a better way of making life while ensuring none of my stones are captured.]
;W[kf]WL[799.969]C[And now I have to deal with an attack on this side... sigh.]
;B[je]BL[191.758]LB[lf:A]C[Since my goal is to be flexible and efficient, I wanted to try avoiding obvious moves like A (M14) since it doesn't quite work at the moment.]
;W[jf]WL[781.909]C[White cuts through my connection.]
;B[if]BL[171.795]TR[le][me]C[So I have no choice but to cut as well and prepare to sacrifice the marked stones (M15 and N15).]
;W[sf]WL[758.34]C[White's throw-in here threw me off for a sec.]
;B[se]BL[156.605]C[But nothing seemed odd, so I went ahead and captured.]
;W[ke]WL[749.198]C[White continues to cut me apart.]
;B[jd]BL[150.151]C[I have to extend.]
;W[jg]WL[731.32]C[So many cuts...]
;B[jh]BL[85.964]LB[ih:B][kh:A]C[This block was conflicting for me since I knew I had these weaknesses at A (M12) and B (J12), but I felt it was the best move since it kept White's group to two liberties.]
;W[kd]WL[709.313]C[White extends and threatens to further cut Black apart.]
;B[kc]BL[78.775]LB[he:B][lf:A]C[So I connect here feeling pretty good since I'm thinking A (M14) and B (H15) will be miai.]
;W[id]WL[693.677]C[Except oh right, White has a forcing move. ]
;B[jc]BL[63.301]C[I connect while thinking, "Oh crap I'm in trouble."]
;W[kh]WL[677.916]LB[he:A]C[White expoits my weakness as expected. And now the question becomes. Does the ladder work with A (H15)? Try and read it out!]
;B[he]BL[22.117]C[After checking a couple of times, I decide that the ladder works out in my favor.]
;W[hd]WL[657.694]C[White doesn't think.]
;B[gd]BL[18.195]C[Atari.]
;W[hc]WL[645.542]C[Runs.]
;B[gc]BL[1.108]C[Atari from this direction is the key move.]
;W[hb]WL[641.602]C[White can continue to run]
;B[gb]BL[30]OB[5]C[But Black can still keep White to two liberties.]
;W[ge]WL[638.387]C[For the ladder reading, you also must have read out this part as well. And it certainly looks pretty dangerous for Black.]
;B[hf]BL[30]OB[5]C[I connect.]
;W[sh]WL[629.501]C[White throws in here again.]
;B[si]BL[30]OB[5]C[So I just capture.]
;W[rk]WL[605.666]C[White threatens my second eye.]
;B[rj]BL[30]OB[5]C[So I block.]
;W[ih]WL[585.064]C[And now White cuts here, but I am one step ahead in this capturing race.]
;B[ha]BL[30]OB[5]LB[gg:A]C[So I decide to capture directly. HOWEVER, this is not the most efficient move since simply moving out with a move like A (G13) would have been more than adequate and far more effective.]
;W[gf]WL[566.525]C[Unfortunately my impulsivity allows White to play out this ladder.]
;B[hg]BL[30]OB[5]C[I decide to play out the ladder as much as I can since I know that my stones are safe.]
;W[hh]WL[551.094]C[White ataris.]
;B[gg]BL[30]OB[5]C[I run.]
;W[fg]WL[533.081]C[Atari.]
;B[gh]BL[30]OB[5]C[Run.]
;W[ib]WL[529.624]C[White runs once more.]
;B[jb]BL[30]OB[5]LB[gi:A]C[And yet again I respond directly to White's run, but what I really should have done is just extend at A (G11). Talk about following my opponent around the board. Haha.]
;W[gi]WL[514.562]C[So White gets to continue the ladder.]
;B[fh]BL[30]OB[5]C[I run.]
;W[fi]WL[512.202]C[Atari again.]
;B[ia]BL[30]OB[5]LB[ff:A]C[I want to keep the weakness at A (F14) available for later, so I go ahead and capture now.]
;W[mn]WL[496.367]C[White hanes here as I expected from earlier.]
;B[mo]BL[30]OB[5]C[I extend to prevent White from penetrating my area.]
;W[ln]WL[473.477]C[White extends and threatens to cut.]
;B[kn]BL[30]OB[5]LB[mm:B][ko:A]C[But I had this shape anticipated already and knew that my descent down would give me a miai of A (L5) and B (N7).]
;W[mm]WL[453.731]C[White repairs the weakness here.]
;B[jp]BL[30]OB[5]C[So I protect the cut with this knight's move (which is more efficient than simply connection or playing a tiger's mouth.]
;W[no]WL[414.116]C[White's cut here gives me pause yet again since I'm worried I missed something about my shape.]
;B[np]BL[30]OB[5]C[But it seems okay for me, so I simply atari to prevent as little shenanigans as possible.]
;W[op]WL[390.514]C[White hanes and for a second I think it looks dangeous.]
;B[oo]BL[30]OB[5]C[But again, the simple capture seemed to be the best response.]
;W[ip]WL[363.455]C[White blocks my shoulder hit from earlier.]
;B[jo]BL[30]OB[5]C[I decide a simple extension up would be the best shape and give me solid sabaki as well.]
;W[kl]WL[341.124]C[White's attachment here was quite effective since I was really hoping I could jump in the center.]
;B[jl]BL[30]OB[4]LB[jm:A]C[I decide to hane here since I know that White cannot cut at A (K7).]
;W[jk]WL[315.335]C[White hanes again, and now I'm feeling a bit stifled since White is starting to seal off a bit of the center.]
;B[kk]BL[30]OB[3]C[After some thought, I'm thinking that I'll atari here and move out into the center with a second atari.]
;W[ll]WL[300.997]C[White extends as expected.]
;B[ik]BL[30]OB[3]LB[jj:A]C[And then I absent-mindedly atari here thinking White will extend at A (K10).]
;W[il]WL[265.051]C[Except for the fact that White doesn't have to do what I expect... Whoops! Although to be honest, I was very happy to see White go against my expectations.]
;B[jj]BL[30]OB[3]C[Have to capture now.]
;W[jm]WL[234.053]C[They say that one part of getting stronger is that I must never back down from a ko fight. So let's do this!]
;B[im]BL[30]OB[3]C[Let the ko fight begin!]
;W[jk]WL[215.331]C[White captures the first ko.]
;B[ji]BL[30]OB[3]TR[hh][ih]C[I decide my first threat will be to capture the marked stones since I wanted to reduce the center.]
;W[jl]WL[187.531]C[To my surprise, White connects to end the ko fight.]
;B[hi]BL[30]OB[3]C[So I take my prize here.]
;W[hj]WL[170.124]C[White ataris.]
;B[ij]BL[30]OB[3]C[So I defend with the more efficient snapback tesuji.]
;W[hk]WL[154.388]C[White seals off any entry for Black on this side.]
;B[lj]BL[30]OB[3]C[So I go ahead and start reducing the other side.]
;W[nq]WL[130.353]C[White's hane here leads me to belief White may be trying to live in the corner somehow.]
;B[mq]BL[30]OB[3]C[So I keep White's liberties to a minimum.]
;W[br]WL[108.473]C[White extends.]
;B[bs]BL[30]OB[3]C[So I firmly atari from this direction.]
;W[bc]WL[87.471]C[White extends here.]
;B[db]BL[30]OB[3]C[Again, this is the more efficient way to capture the White stones.]
;W[eb]WL[59.337]C[When White blocks here though...]
;B[bb]BL[30]OB[3]C[I've got no choice but to turn back and keep the two stones at two liberties.]
;W[fd]WL[51.68]C[White seals off his territory.]
;B[jr]BL[30]OB[3]LB[kr:A]C[So I jump here knowing that a move at A (L2) by White would be pretty big as far as an endgame goes.]
;W[ld]WL[31.279]TR[le][me]C[White threatens to cut off the marked stones.]
;B[md]BL[30]OB[3]C[But White cannot cut since this puts White in atari.]
;W[lf]WL[28.273]C[White needs to connect.]
;B[mc]BL[30]OB[3]C[So I can connect in safety.]
;W[in]WL[30]OW[5]C[White's move here was nice since it really started to solidify White's territory in this area.]
;B[hr]BL[30]OB[3]C[However, since White ignored my initial slide, I jumped in.]
;W[qr]WL[30]OW[5]C[White's slide here seemed like an intent to live.]
;B[pq]BL[30]OB[3]C[So I keep it simple by keeping White separated.]
;W[sr]WL[30]OW[5]LB[rq:A]C[When White jumps here, I debated playing A (S3) to end any possibility of White living, but I wanted to try and find a more efficient move (even if it meant White might accidentally live).]
;B[rn]BL[30]OB[2]C[So based on my reading, White cannot live and I can use this move to further expand my territory while preventing White from threatening to connect while gaining eye space.]
;W[rm]WL[30]OW[5]C[White blocks.]
;B[so]BL[30]OB[2]C[So I form a tiger's mouth to further solidify my area.]
;W[pr]WL[30]OW[5]C[White extends here.]
;B[oq]BL[30]OB[2]LB[rs:A]C[And I instinctively just want to separate White so I play here, but this is my downfall. I should have just played A (S1).]
;W[rq]WL[30]OW[5]C[White now finds the way to life.]
;B[rs]BL[30]OB[2]C[I don't see it yet unfortunately.]
;W[rp]WL[30]OW[5]C[So that tiger's mouth I thought was so efficient? Yeah.... now White gets a second eye.]
;B[ro]BL[30]OB[2]C[I have to connect since otherwise White connects up with the other stones.]
;W[sp]WL[30]OW[5]C[But bam, White is alive. Whoops. Guess I have more to improve on for my reading!]
;B[or]BL[30]OB[2]C[I block in order to prevent White from doing any more damage.]
;W[rr]WL[30]OW[5]C[White connecting here was unnecessary.]
;B[fo]BL[30]OB[2]C[I jump here thinking I'll get to further reduce White's territory.]
;W[gq]WL[30]OW[5]C[White's clamp here was a fantastic response that made me realize I was not only not reducing White, but I was actually going to lose F3 as well.]
;B[hq]BL[30]OB[2]C[I try to cut my losses with this simple push.]
;W[gp]WL[30]OW[5]C[White responds with a simple extension.]
;B[ho]BL[30]OB[2]C[So I jump in since I miai for connecting.]
;W[io]WL[30]OW[5]C[White blocks one.]
;B[hp]BL[30]OB[2]C[So I naturally take the other.]
;W[go]WL[30]OW[5]C[White prevents me from connecting.]
;B[gr]BL[30]OB[2]C[So I figure I would turn here once to threaten to connect.]
;W[fp]WL[30]OW[5]LB[fr:A]C[So my surprise, White atari's from the top, but A (F3) would certainly have been better.]
;B[fr]BL[30]OB[2]LB[nb:B][mj:C][bm:A]C[I got ahead and save my stone, but to be honest, that was really small as far as endgame goes. I should have just ignored and played a bigger point like the ones I've labelled on the board.]
;W[jq]WL[30]OW[5]C[White pushes through here.]
;B[kr]BL[30]OB[2]LB[kq:A][ir:B]C[I instinctively pull back here for fear of White descending at B (J2), but I honestly should have just bumped White at A (L3). Bad move on my part.]
;W[ds]WL[30]OW[5]C[White ataris in the corner.]
;B[ar]BL[30]OB[2]C[So I obviously need to capture.]
;W[bj]WL[30]OW[5]C[White threatens to save A12. ]
;B[bi]BL[30]OB[2]LB[bk:A]C[So I go ahead and play here threatning A (B9) at the same time.]
;W[bk]WL[30]OW[5]C[White connects.]
;B[ff]BL[30]OB[2]C[So I take sente to go ahead and collect some extra points here, but again this is really small since I'm going to end in gote.]
;W[fe]WL[30]OW[5]C[White obviously saves the two stones.]
;B[eg]BL[30]OB[2]C[So I capture one measly stone.]
;W[ef]WL[30]OW[5]C[And now White gets this atari too. Sigh. My endgame is such a mess.]
;B[mj]BL[30]OB[2]C[I was expecting us to go till the endgame since I was pretty sure the margin wasn't that large, but White resigns here.])
(;W[bn]C[White seals Black in.]
;B[co]C[Black threatens to come out.]
;W[do]C[White blocks Blacks escape.]
;B[cp]LB[bp:A]C[Black connects in order to prevent the tesuji clamp / jump at A (B4).]
;W[em]TR[gn]C[And then White will typically defend the cut with a move like this. Though in this situation, it may be a bit overconcentrated due to the presence of the marked stone (G6).]))
