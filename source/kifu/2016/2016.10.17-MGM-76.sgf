;B[pd]BL[597.054]C[Since I'm still not playing as much as I'd like, I've continued to stick with the star point for my first move as Black since my opening is a bit weak at the moment.

I do have intentions of eventaully only playing 3-4 opening moves to get more practice with those joseki as well, but all in due time.]
;W[dp]WL[599.723]C[White chooses opposite corner star point. No cross-fuseki possible anymore.]
;B[qp]BL[594.227]C[Works for me though since I have little interest in playing one at this point. So let's prepare a possible micro-Chinese opening.]
;W[dd]WL[599.427]C[Double hoshi (star point).]
;B[fq]BL[592.571]C[Time to approach!]
;W[cn]WL[599.134]C[Calm knight move response.]
;B[lq]BL[590.02]C[So I go ahead and set up an opening I'm comfortable with: micro-Chinese.

I thought I'd mention that I do plan on changing this up soon. Maybe I should just play regular Chinese opening soon as a throwback. Haha. ]
;W[qj]WL[598.827]C[White splits the right side.]
;B[qg]BL[587.028]C[I use the large knight to strengthen my upper right area while attacking White.]
;W[qm]WL[598.462]LB[pn:A][op:B]C[White settles with a two space extension as expected.

At this point I'm debating how to play. I want to say that I've seen A (Q6) used as a technique to attack White, but I can't remember where I saw that and there was a bit of discussion regarding the validity of that move. 

I also considered B (P4) as well, but it felt a bit slow as far as the whole board was concerned.]
;B[fc]BL[557.011]C[So I approached the upper left to see what What planned to do.]
;W[eb]WL[597.073]LB[fb:A]C[I don't even know what to say about this move except that I was surprised. My immediate instinct was to play a move at A (F18), but it didn't seem right considering I had done no prior work to indicate I would have any chance taking territory up top.]
;B[cf]BL[534.619]C[So I went ahead and used a double approach to try and be flexible against White's odd play.]
;W[ce]WL[595.738]C[White kicks which seemed weird to me at the time, but it seems to be with the intention of taking the corner.]
;B[df]BL[532.079]C[I'm unsure of what to do at this point and can only rely on my knowledge that I need to stand up when kicked.]
;W[di]WL[594.441]LB[eb:B][cc:A]C[White then immediately pincers which is a bit frustrating since I'm now left with an awkward position.

Part of me is considering the possibility of A (C17), but the placement of B (F18) is making it seem difficult for me to invade.]
;B[fe]BL[511.148]C[So I go with the one point jump here in order to strengthen the relationship between my stones and hopefully seal White in.

]
;W[gd]WL[593.131]C[White peeps.]
;B[fd]BL[503.639]C[So I go ahead and connect.]
;W[fb]WL[591.835]LB[gc:A]C[White's move here threatens to connect the stones together with the descent at A (G17).]
;B[gc]BL[495.102]C[Letting White connect that easily would give me a very heavy group to deal with, so I felt it was important to turn and keep White separated.]
;W[ic]WL[590.436]LB[gd:A]C[White's move here is light and doesn't really commit to the A (G16) stone while also preparing to connect with the F18 stones.]
;B[kc]BL[444.752]LB[hf:A]TR[fc][gc][fd][fe][cf][df]C[I decided not to respond directly and try to play big moves, but this is debatable as I have weak stones on the upper left. So while this may indirectly help my stones, I think that a move like A (H15) would have been better.]
;W[hc]WL[589.024]LB[gb:B][gd:A]C[Interestingly enough, White decides to focus more on defending the A (G16) stone instead of connecting under with a move like B (G18).]
;B[gb]BL[442.116]C[Easy decision for me then since now White has a weak group as well!]
;W[kd]WL[587.722]C[White attaches to make shape.]
;B[ld]BL[438.053]C[I hane in order to start making some sort of framework for possibly gaining territory in the upper right.]
;W[ke]WL[586.381]C[White extends as expected.]
;B[jc]BL[433.964]LB[lc:A]C[So I extend as well to take the shape point while simultaneously protecting myself from the cut at A (M17).]
;W[jd]WL[585.073]LB[lc:A]C[White makes an empty triangle here since is bad shape, but one thing I completely miss is that this move now makes A (M17) dangerous for me again.]
;B[le]BL[423.678]C[I don't see that and extend in order to continue on the upper right framework.]
;W[kf]WL[583.76]C[White extends again since a hane here would be very painful for White.]
;B[lf]BL[403.305]C[I extend as well thinking I'm looking pretty good.]
;W[lg]WL[582.453]C[White hanes.]
;B[kg]BL[394.483]LB[lc:A][id:B][mg:C]C[And rather impulsively I decide to cut as well (completely oblivious to the cut at A (M17) but thinking that this would create aji for possible shenanigans at B (J16). However, this is an overplay in hindsight. I should probably have played a move like C (N13).]
;W[jg]WL[581.069]C[White ataris.]
;B[kh]BL[393.15]C[So I run and extend.]
;W[jh]WL[579.767]C[White follows.]
;B[ki]BL[391.234]LB[mg:A]C[I extend once more hoping to get a net with A (N13).]
;W[lc]WL[578.448]LB[mc:A][qc:C][lg:B]C[And then White cuts and I realize I'm in trouble. My initial reaction was to simply play A (N17) as a sacrifice tactic to "solidify the upper right. The issue with that sequence though, is that there are still weaknesses like B (M13) and C (R17) that Black has to worry about. ]
;B[ib]BL[377.685]C[So I come up with this sequence instead!

This hane threatens to connect up Black's stones.]
;W[hb]WL[577.128]LB[hd:A]C[So White naturally is going to block.

And if you're not seeing it, I'm also looking at shenanigans with A (H16) as well.]
;B[lb]BL[359.436]C[Now I atari from the bottom.]
;W[mc]WL[575.784]C[White extends.]
;B[mb]BL[343.579]LB[sa:B][nc:A]C[I extend again knowing I can capture White iwith A (O17). If you don't believe me, click B (T19) to see the variation.]
(;W[mf]WL[574.396]TR[ld][le][lf]C[White hanes to threaten to capture my marked stones.]
;B[mg]BL[323.538]C[But I had a tesuji with this atari.]
;W[lh]WL[573.028]C[White extends.]
;B[me]BL[315.296]LB[mh:A]TR[kg][kh][ki]C[I can now atari here.

Note: I did not want to play A (N12) since it would give White the opportunity to ladder the marked stones.]
;W[li]WL[571.742]C[White extends to threaten the ladder.]
;B[kj]BL[302.971]C[I extend to prevent it.]
;W[nf]WL[570.299]LB[nc:B][ne:A]C[When White extends here, I debate following with A (O15), but I realize that White's extension at B (O17) would make my life really difficult.]
;B[nc]BL[290.865]C[So while I knew I was going to end in gote with this, I needed to secure my group.]
;W[ne]WL[568.991]C[This atari sucked, but there was not much to be done about it at this point.]
;B[md]BL[288.654]C[Clean capture and at least my stones are okay now.]
;W[pe]WL[567.334]C[White attaches.]
;B[qe]BL[279.589]C[I hane to start solidifying the upper right territory.]
;W[lj]WL[566.062]C[White extends again.]
;B[kk]BL[256.514]TR[hb][hc][ic][gd][jd][kd][ke][kf][jg][jh]C[So I run again knowing full well that my group is looking a bit silly, but these are important cutting stones that continue to leave the White marked group semi-vulnerable.]
;W[lk]WL[564.759]LB[kl:A]C[White extends once more and I'm debating now whether to respond with A (L8).]
