;B[qd]BL[2387.638]C[Over the past few games, I've been using the 3-4 as my opening move to change things up a bit since I use to always start with the star point.]
;W[dp]WL[2397.67]C[White chooses the opposing corner with a star point and gives no indication of his intentions yet.]
;B[pq]BL[2382.659]C[So alternating 3-4 it is since the strong side of this 3-4 faces the star point which would make it easier to approach later on if I wanted.]
;W[dc]WL[2389.509]C[Ah. So the 3-4 facing the weak side of my upper right corner... that's how White wants to play it.]
;B[de]BL[2378.204]LB[fq:A]C[In the past, I've almost always played A (F3) since I thought it would work well in conjunction with the Q3 stone (triangle); but after some discussion with Oren, this move became a viable choice and I decided to try it out this game.]
;W[ce]WL[2386.589]C[White chooses the attach joseki.]
;B[cf]BL[2357.041]C[No problem. I'll just follow along.]
;W[cd]WL[2384.413]LB[df:A][dg:B]C[White pulls back to keep his stones connected, and now I'm faced with a choice of either A (D14) or B (D13).]
(;B[dg]BL[2343.497]C[I decided to go with the tiger's mouth variation because I wanted my group to be as settled as possible while making the choice a little more difficult for White after the joseki was over. 

To see what I mean, go back to Move 8 and click on D14 to see what I mean.]
;W[fd]WL[2382.724]LB[fc:A]C[To my surprise, White plays this knight's move which is not joseki. The proper move is at A (F17).]
;B[ck]BL[2340.643]C[Though one might be tempted to immediately try and punish it somehow, I've learned that it's best to leave the aji for later on since it's often difficult to punish a move immediately. So I took my extension and waited to see what White would do.]
;W[po]WL[2368.663]LB[od:A]C[I was expecting White to approach the upper right with a move like A (P16), so I was a little surprised when he approached here instead.]
;B[pl]BL[2306.172]C[I debated over what to do for a while, but I decided to make the game a bit more complicated by choosing the two space high pincer. After all, I needed more practice with it, so why not?]
;W[qq]WL[2364.995]C[To my surprise but delight, White makes a mistake and chooses this attachment. I'll explain why this is a mistake momentarily.]
;B[qr]BL[2297.643]LB[qp:A]C[Following the normal attach joseki, I hane to prevent White from gaining an easy base while also threatening the cut at A (R4).]
;W[qp]WL[2344.559]C[White pulls back to keep his stones connected.]
;B[or]BL[2283.485]C[And then I take the secure tiger's mouth shape to stabilize my group.]
;W[rm]WL[2336.82]LB[qk:A][ql:B]TR[pl]C[At this point, the attach joseki normally has White extending at A (R9) or B (R8), but with the Q8 stone (triangle) in place, you can see that White has to choose a sub-optimal extension like the move here.]
;B[fq]BL[2201.239]C[I decided to ignore White here and approach his corner, but this is a mistake. I should have kept up the pressure on White on the lower right.]
;W[cn]WL[2329.43]C[White responds with the knight's move to stabilize his group.]
;B[jp]BL[2184.373]LB[np:A]C[So I take this move with intentions of making a moyo, but this is a bit of an overplay since Black does not have the move at A (O4) already. As a result, this was too obvious in regards to what Black was trying to get.]
;W[od]WL[2298.47]C[White didn't get the memo apparently or didn't think it was important, so he approach my corner again.]
;B[ld]BL[2159.915]C[Because White was not able to respond correctly in the lower right, I thought I would go ahead and do the two-space high pincer again to see what he would come up with.]
;W[qc]WL[2286.476]C[Sure enough, White attached just like before.]
;B[rc]BL[2154.05]C[So I respond as before since I know that White cannot make efficient shape.]
;W[pc]WL[2283.042]C[White pulls back to keep his stones connected.]
;B[re]BL[2151.923]C[I make strong shape again.]
;W[mc]WL[2274.942]C[And then White decides to make this very short extension here to try and make a base. ]
;B[hc]BL[2136.235]LB[ic:B][lc:A][fd:C]C[To be honest, my first instinct was to descent at A (M17), but I thought White would ignore me and extend at like B (J17) instead. As a result, I chose this move to possibly take advantage of White joseki mistake of C (F16) earlier. However, this is a mistake since A (M17) was actually the proper move due to White's mistake.]
;W[jc]WL[2266.418]C[White takes advantage of my mistake and threatens to separate my stones.]
;B[jd]BL[2107.536]C[So I attach to try and maintain the connection.]
;W[ic]WL[2260.103]C[White extends.]
;B[id]BL[2099.552]C[I continue trying to maintain connectivity between my stones.]
;W[lc]WL[2254.723]C[White now further establishes a base on top and has made a nice bit of territory.]
;B[kc]BL[2094.669]C[I decide to push in order to create defects in White's shape.]
;W[kb]WL[2253.405]C[White blocks.]
;B[kd]BL[2092.945]C[I connect.]
;W[ib]WL[2246.978]C[And then White makes an ugly empty triangle. I guess he was trying to protect the cutting points, but this doesn't seem like a good result for him.]
;B[ec]BL[2076.773]TR[hc]C[With the H17 stone (triangle) in place, I felt it was time to take advantage of White's joseki mistake earlier and attach.]
;W[gc]WL[2229.8]C[White surprisingly clamps and ignore my attachment.]
;B[ed]BL[2060.119]C[I decide to go ahead and extend to cut off the corner.]
;W[hd]WL[2221.866]C[White naturally takes the atari here]
;B[be]BL[1992.157]C[But now I can harrass the corner in sente.]
;W[bd]WL[2219.15]C[White blocks.]
;B[bf]BL[1988.286]C[I connect and threaten to further attack the group's eye space.]
;W[bb]WL[2207.081]C[So White takes a shape point to ensure his corner doesn't die.]
;B[he]BL[1961.11]C[Now that I have sente, I wanted to take this forcing move now before White had a chance to extend since it seemed that I had a bit of potential in the center.]
;W[hb]WL[2203.483]TR[hc]C[White captures to remove the aji of the H17 stone (triangle).]
;B[np]BL[1948.051]C[And now I decide to take the shape point on the bottom. However, while this is big, there are more urgent points on the point to be taken care of (details omitted).]
;W[pf]WL[2197.015]C[White now tries to take advantage of Black's tenuki from this area, but this is the wrong move to do so. (Details omitted)]
;B[qg]BL[1917.778]C[Black's knight's move here shows that White's move does not severely punish Black's tenuki since he can elevate his formation to the 3rd line.]
;W[ge]WL[2147.098]TR[kc][id][jd][kd][ld][he]C[White decides to make nice shape here and you'll notice that that the L17 stones (triangle) are now cut off.]
;B[cq]BL[1850.201]C[I didn't feel they were in any immediate danger however, so I decided to weaken White's group here and remove his base.]
;W[dq]WL[2139.686]C[White blocks the correct direction.]
;B[dr]BL[1847.661]C[Hane to threaten to connect under.]
;W[er]WL[2138.176]C[White blocks the connection.]
;B[cr]BL[1846.103]LB[eq:A]C[Connect and threaten to cut at A (E3).]
;W[eq]WL[2136.522]C[Connect to protect the cut.]
;B[bo]BL[1844.651]C[Knight's move to expand my eyespace.]
;W[co]WL[2126.849]LB[bn:A]C[I was a little surprised to see this since I normally see A (B6) instead, but after the game, I found out that this is the variation you choose when the more common sequence at A (B6) is dangerous because of the cut. 

If you don't know what I'm talking about though, don't worry too much about it. Just know that this is a viable option in this joseki.]
;B[bn]BL[1827.939]C[I wasn't sure at the time, but this extension is the proper continuation.]
;W[bm]WL[2122.647]LB[cm:B][bp:A]C[White can now block because of the weakness at A (B4) which prevents Black from cutting at B (C7) unless Black wants to give up the corner to White.]
;B[cp]BL[1741.769]C[So I have no choice but to protect the weakness.]
;W[dm]WL[2102.539]C[White then protects the cutting point.]
;B[fp]BL[1691.96]C[Up to this point, what I will say is that Inseong felt that the game was relatively even. Being able to take this key point was one of the first steps to giving me the advantage.]
;W[gr]WL[2076.998]C[White jumps to prevent Black from getting a huge bottom.]
;B[eo]BL[1654.069]C[I peep to give White heavy shape.]
;W[do]WL[2071.015]C[White connects.]
;B[cl]BL[1644.46]C[Peep once again and threaten to take sizeable profit on the left.]
;W[cm]WL[2067.497]C[White connects again.]
;B[fr]BL[1637.68]C[Descend and threaten to cut.]
;W[fs]WL[2063.792]C[White connects under.]
;B[hq]BL[1595.573]C[And now I jump in order to keep my stones connected while aiming to keep the damage to my bottom to a minimum.]
;W[en]WL[2051.467]C[White starts forming his first eye.]
;B[el]BL[1527.233]C[I jump to threaten to falsify it.]
;W[dl]WL[2016.197]C[White pushes through.]
;B[dk]BL[1522.844]C[I turn and threaten to connect.]
;W[fo]WL[2013.178]C[White then starts with the forcing move here.]
;B[ep]BL[1508.587]C[I have to connect to prevent White from gaining easy life since I want to keep harrassing this group.]
;W[em]WL[2000.907]C[White then forms his first real eye.]
;B[go]BL[1488.967]C[I decide to take this shape point since it would be sente for White if he got it instead.]
;W[fl]WL[1993.515]C[White decides to make the atari here first.]
;B[ek]BL[1483.561]C[Since I had potential on the left, I connected to improve my potential here.]
;W[fn]WL[1991.962]C[White then connected to save his stone.]
;B[gn]BL[1472.581]C[So I extend to falsify the eye and keep White at one eye.]
;W[gm]WL[1985.621]C[White hanes and continues running towards the center.]
;B[in]BL[1431.639]LB[gp:A]C[With the weakness at A (G4) staring at me, I chose the one point jump here in order to keep my groups strong and firmly connected.]
;W[hr]WL[1972.069]C[White pushes to further reduce my bottom.]
;B[iq]BL[1382.023]C[I extend calmly to ensure no more cutting points are exposed for White to take advantage of.]
;W[gj]WL[1948.129]C[White now jumps to the center.]
;B[fk]BL[1370.587]C[I decide to keep harrassing the group by threatening to cut.]
;W[gk]WL[1946.235]C[White extends and maintains his connection.]
;B[hl]BL[1364.491]C[I peep.]
;W[gl]WL[1937.406]C[White naturally connects.]
;B[hm]BL[1359.09]C[Out of the desire to make good shape, I extended downwards, but this was a dubious move. Details are omitted, but the idea you should be thinking is what the value of this move is. Short answer: very little.]
;W[ij]WL[1921.168]TR[kc][id][jd][kd][ld][he]C[White jumps into the center and now it's quite apparent that my L17 group (triangle) is getting surrounded and needs help.]
;B[lh]BL[1211.726]LB[lf:A]C[So I make this big jump in order to maintain light shape in case White tries to invade with a move like A (M14).]
;W[pg]WL[1903.147]LB[qh:A]C[White tries to execute a leaning attack by inducing Black to play at A (R12).]
;B[hf]BL[1194.855]C[But I knew better than to respond and strengthened my group in the center.]
;W[fg]WL[1897.005]C[White keeps my groups firmly separated.]
;B[hh]BL[1171.794]C[So I just calmly jump to keep strengthening my center group.]
;W[eh]WL[1818.934]C[This kosumi (i.e., diagonal) might seem slow, but from what I could see, White was trying to cut off the E9 group (triangle) and destroy my territory on the left.]
;B[di]BL[1115.473]TR[bm]C[So I jumped here to maintain connection and try to keep what I had on the left. It's worth noting though that because Black is already undercut by White at B7 (triangle), it's a little unrealistic to Black to think he has much on the left.]
;W[ef]WL[1813.973]TR[ec][ed][de]C[White peeps and threatens to cut off the E17 stones (triangle).]
;B[df]BL[1100.004]C[I connect.]
;W[dh]WL[1801.433]C[White pushes through and threatens to cut.]
;B[ch]BL[1092.117]C[I block.]
;W[ei]WL[1800.297]C[White's turn here didn't seem very threatening.]
;B[rl]BL[1078.93]TR[rm][po][qp][qq]C[So I decided to take the big point here to harrass the R4 group (triangle) and possibly gain some territory on the right.]
;W[qm]WL[1792.648]C[White stands up.]
(;B[dj]BL[1017.432]LB[ql:A]C[At this point, I panicked and thought that maybe White could kill the E9 stones, so I came back to protect here. In reality though, A (R8) was very urgent and my fears might have been groundless.

To see what I was worried about though, go back to Move 110 and click on R8.]
;W[gh]WL[1774.094]C[To my relief, White responded once more in this area and gave me sente.]
;B[ql]BL[1003.808]C[So I came back and strengthened my stones with this connection.]
;W[no]WL[1765.258]C[White attached to gain some breathing room in the center while reducing my moyo potential.]
;B[op]BL[953.896]LB[oo:A]C[I pull back in order to protect any defects from being exposed in my shape while also aiming at the push and cut at A (P5).]
;W[pm]WL[1737.662]C[White tries to protect the cut indirectly.]
;B[oo]BL[936.725]C[But it doesn't work and I follow through on my threat to push and cut.]
;W[ol]WL[1732.638]LB[on:A]C[White realizes that blocking at A (P6) does not protect against the cut, so he tries to take initative with this hane instead.]
;B[ok]BL[919.242]C[I hane once to strengthen my stones.]
;W[nl]WL[1724.896]C[White extends.]
;B[nn]BL[860.175]LB[om:A]C[And now I make the atari while threatening the cut at A (P7).]
;W[on]WL[1691.136]C[White protects his connectio in good shape.]
;B[mo]BL[849.532]C[And with this move, I must have felt I was ahead since I calmly captured the stone to remove its aji.]
;W[qj]WL[1689.058]C[White now strikes the shape point for Black to harrass it.]
;B[pj]BL[814.138]LB[qi:A][mj:B]C[But the hane from earlier shows its value here as I make easy shape while having the options at connecting at either A (R11) or B (N10).]
;W[qh]WL[1684.654]C[White makes a nice hane here.]
;B[rg]BL[804.869]C[The descent felt to be the strongest move since it didn't expose additional cutting points while giving my possibilities of connecting under later on.]
;W[pi]WL[1660.902]C[White makes good shape.]
;B[oi]BL[761.246]C[I respond in kind as I make my way out to the center.]
;W[oh]WL[1653.73]C[White continues making strong shape, but I'm not concerned about his ponnuki since I am strong all around.]
;B[ni]BL[704.501]C[I extend to prevent White from gaining a free atari.]
;W[ll]WL[1639.795]C[White now jumps in order to prevent Black from sealing him in and being forced to make life in the corner.]
;B[mk]BL[671.834]C[I peep from this direction in order to strengthen my own connections.]
;W[nk]WL[1632.006]C[White pushes to remove one of my eyes.]
;B[nj]BL[652.118]C[And then the empty triangle is the best way for me to keep all of my stones connected.]
;W[ml]WL[1629.682]C[White connects.]
;B[lj]BL[642.121]C[I make a tiger's mouth for shape.]
;W[kj]WL[1621.168]C[White attaches.]
;B[ki]BL[634.656]C[So I hane to continue making shaep since I need to find some eyes in order to prevent my entire center from dying.]
;W[lk]WL[1619.441]C[White ataris to reduce Black's eyespace.]
;B[mj]BL[624.33]C[I connect.]
;W[jl]WL[1587.974]LB[kk:A]C[White protects the cut at A (L9).]
;B[ir]BL[598.143]C[At this point, I'm pretty sure I'm ahead, so I decide to turn here and solidify my bottom territory.]
;W[mh]WL[1577.907]C[White falsifies one of my eyes.]
;B[mg]BL[576.325]C[But I'm not concerned since I feel that I have a lot of eye space in the center.]
;W[nh]WL[1574.168]C[White connects.]
;B[mf]BL[487.344]C[And I decide to stand up since I have cutting points like A (M13) to be worried about.]
;W[rb]WL[1569.054]TR[rc][qd][re][qg][rg]C[White now turns his attention to my S17 group (triangle).]
;B[sb]BL[468.395]LB[qb:A]TR[rb]C[Hane under while threatening to capture the S18 stone (triangle) with A (R18).]
;W[sc]WL[1560.304]C[When I saw this, I could have sworn White misclicked.]
;B[sd]BL[465.052]C[But after waiting a few seconds a seeing no undo request, I went ahead and captured.]
;W[ra]WL[1559.454]C[When White extends here, I realize that White is trying to kill me.]
;B[rh]BL[452.234]LB[qf:A][si:B]C[When you're trying to make life, it's always best to expand your eye space before flat out making life with a move like A (R14), so that's why I turn here. In addition, I'm also thtreatening to connect my stones up with a move like B (T11).]
;W[ri]WL[1555.263]C[White blocks the connection.]
;B[qf]BL[435.846]C[So now I make living shape.]
;W[pe]WL[1541.647]LB[qe:A][sf:B]C[When White extends here, I thought it might be sente, but then I realized I have a miai for life at A (R15) and B (T14), so I tenuki'd.]
;B[eb]BL[390.567]C[With this descent, I wanted to reduce White's territory in sente since I could harrass White's corner if he ignores me.]
;W[db]WL[1536.613]C[White defends his corner as expected.]
;B[sm]BL[369.966]C[When finding endgame moves, these kind of hane sente moves are usually very valuable.]
;W[sn]WL[1534.181]C[White blocks.]
;B[sl]BL[368.498]C[I connect.]
;W[rn]WL[1527.897]C[And White must connect in gote. ]
;B[bl]BL[350.685]C[Though I realy wanted to play A (S2), I felt that blocking here was more urgen since it removed a monkey jump from White's arsenal.]
;W[an]WL[1525.197]LB[bp:A]C[White hanes and threatens the atari at A (B4).]
;B[ap]BL[346.053]C[Tiger's mouth to protect the cutting point.]
;W[ko]WL[1522.041]C[White tries to reduce black's territory here, but this is just one line too deep.]
;B[kn]BL[319.598]C[Black can attach here and cut off the stone easily.]
;W[jn]WL[1501.086]LB[jo:A]C[White tries to get fancy with this wedge. If you think you would have played at A (K5), click on A (K5) to see why it is exactly what White wants.]
(;B[ln]BL[288.557]LB[jm:A][jo:B]C[So the proper move here is to extend since Black can wedge at A (K7) if White connects at B (K5).]
;W[ih]WL[1419.425]C[White clamps now to reduce my eye space and possibily kill my group.]
;B[ig]BL[265.561]C[I hane here, but I would be lying if I told you I wasn't a bit worried that I was overestimating the strength of my strength here.]
;W[jh]WL[1412.955]C[White extends.]
;B[jg]BL[261.03]C[I extend to keep my eye space as big as possible.]
;W[kh]WL[1401.365]C[White pushes once more.]
;B[kg]BL[254.948]C[And then I seal off White from reducing my eye space any further.]
;W[ji]WL[1391.749]TR[ni][oi][lj][mj][nj][pj][mk][ok][pl][ql][rl][sl][sm]C[White ataris and threatens to cut off my entire M10 group (triangle).]
;B[li]BL[252.235]C[So I must connect.]
;W[hi]WL[1390.84]C[White ataris, but I felt this was too small to respond to since White would have to capture in gote anyway if he really wanted that stone.]
;B[jm]BL[181.493]C[So I took the wedge here now to increase my territory by a couple of points.]
;W[md]WL[1361.377]C[White turns and restricts my eye space a bit more.]
;B[me]BL[167.521]LB[lg:A]C[And so I extend to maximize my eye space, but part of me was a little concerned since there were tesujis for White to use like the throw-in at A (M13) to reduce my eye space.]
;W[rr]WL[1354.406]C[White gets the big point here first.]
;B[rs]BL[165.438]LB[rq:A]C[So I hane underneath to threaten the atari at A (S3).]
;W[sr]WL[1353.147]C[White extends.]
;B[ds]BL[78.751]LB[es:A]C[I descend to expand my corner territory and threaten the cut at A (E1).]
;W[es]WL[1346.698]C[White connects.]
;B[hs]BL[69.915]C[I hane here to remove White's sente endgame play (which makes this reverse gote for those studying endgame).]
;W[am]WL[1338.852]C[White's connection here threatens shenanigans against the lower left corner.]
;B[ar]BL[55.445]C[So I play on the vital point to prevent White from pulling a last minute upset.]
;W[al]WL[1281.806]C[White pushes to reduce.]
;B[ak]BL[52.605]C[I block.]
;W[aj]WL[1278.797]C[White clamps/atari and seems to think he can make something work. This is the first sign I got that White would leave no stone unturned on this board. You'll see what I mean later on.]
;B[bk]BL[45.272]C[I connect.]
;W[bh]WL[1277.502]C[White is now just looking for any weakness in hopes that black will make a mistake.]
;B[bi]BL[40.26]C[I had to keep my eye space while reducing the space for White to maneuver, so the tiger's mouth here seemed to be the right move for the job.]
;W[fb]WL[1264.615]C[White now protects his top.]
;B[kk]BL[14.847]LB[jj:A][kl:B]C[I now cut here since I have a miai of A (K10) and B (L8).]
;W[km]WL[1257.096]C[White tries to make his own play here first.]
;B[jj]BL[275.101]OB[14]C[But I could capture first and force White to choose what he wanted to do.]
;W[im]WL[1218.539]C[He decided to capture.]
;B[jo]BL[267.142]OB[13]TR[ih][jh][kh][ji]C[But that was fine because I could atari here and keep my bottom territory. On top of that, White's K12 stones (triangle) were still in atari, so I would be able to get sente out of this.

In hindsight though, I don't know if the trades I made in this exchange were actually correct. Maybe the K12 stones (triangle) were bigger than I realized. Don't really know.]
;W[hg]WL[1168.867]C[So White captures and saves his stones.]
;B[jm]BL[247.847]OB[12]C[I go ahead and take the ko since it wouldn't hurt to remove one ko threat from White.]

;B[ea]BL[130.18]OB[8]LB[ca:A][fa:B]C[To be honest, this move was bad. I though I might be able to make some sort of endgame tesuji with a move like A (C19), but I should have just hane'd at B (F19) instead.]

;B[sh]BL[300]OB[15]C[So I expand my eyeshape to maximize my territory potential.]

;B[oj]BL[182.473]OB[10]LB[si:A]C[I connect to prevent the tesuji, but this defense is too direct. The better move is A (T11) since it would put White in a shortage of liberty situation of his own.]

;B[pk]BL[180.696]OB[9]C[I connect.]

Some players might be tempted to play A (B13), but that would give White an opportunity to start a ko for seki. Go back to Move 270 and click on A (B13) to see what I mean.]

(;B[bg]C[This move might seem okay, but...]
;W[ag]LB[af:A][bj:B]C[White will play here and start a ko battle for seki which would be an absolute disaster for Black. If you can't see the seki, keep going.]
;B[]C[For the sake of showing the seki, let's pretend Black passes.]
;W[ah]LB[af:A][bj:B]C[When White connects here, Black cannot atari at either A (A14) or B (B10) because it would be self-atari. As a result, it is seki.]))
(;B[ee]C[If Black played somewhere else...]
;W[qe]SQ[se][rf][sf][sg]C[This move is sente because even though it looks like Black has lots of eyes, Black in fact only has eye space in the square area. And if you've done any life and death studying, you'll notice that is the bulky four shape which can be killed. ]
;B[sf]LB[rd:A]C[So Black would need to defend in gote and would also lose the point at A (S16) later on. Painful for Black to lose 2 points in gote to White.]))
(;B[jo]LB[jm:A]C[When you cut here, you are probably thinking White will connect at A (K7) right?]

(;B[ql]C[Assuming I connected at here first.]

;B[dj]C[I would have to connet.]
;W[bh]C[White would then atari here.]
;B[cg]C[Black would connect.]
;W[bj]C[Then White would get this tiger's mouth shape. And though I didn't get to read it out fully, it felt dangerous, so I prevented this from happening. Please note that this is not good practice though. You should really try to read it out fully if possible since making moves out of fear is a big obstacle when trying to get stronger.]))
(;B[df]C[This is the other common variation of this joseki.]
;W[fc]C[White would jump.]
;B[cj]C[And then Black can finish the joseki with this 3-space extension.]
;W[cm]LB[ch:A]C[But I felt that it would be easy for White to choose a corner enclosure like this which would put some pressure on Black since there is an invasion point at A (C12). I didn't like the idea of White getting this, so that's why I chose the tiger's mouth variation you see in the game instead.]))
