;B[pd]
;W[dd]C[Two things to consider with my move. (1) The 4-4 stone allows flexibility based on what Black chooses next. (2) By choosing the upper left corner, this gives Black the option to play a cross-fuseki (which White invites since with komi it is to White's advantage to have a cross-fuseki.]
;B[dp]C[The reason the cross-fuseki is more advantageous to White is because it nullifies Black's advantage of being able to choose a fuseki to his liking (aka Chinese opening, orthodox, sanrensei, etc.).]
;W[pp]C[The 4-4 stone makes the most sense in this fuseki since I am not sure what Black intends to do at the moment. So to keep balance and maximize my options for later on, the 4-4 stone was optimal.]
;B[jj]C[This really threw me off and aggravated me a bit since it was so weird. However, in terms of a calm analysis, you have to remember that cross-fuseki usually end up being territorial games. As a result, controlling the center with tengen will not nearly be as effective as it would be in a moyo game.]
;W[fq]C[So now I choose to probe and see what Black's intentions are.]
;B[cf]C[When he tenuki'd and ignored me, I will admit that I was actually a bit peeved. ]
;W[fc]C[No matter. I chose to go ahead and play calm and solid moves.]
;B[gd]C[WHAT... THE.... ]
;W[gc]C[G16 seemed to aim to press White down and possibly seal White in from the top, as a result, I decided to push and prevent him from sealing me in so early.]
;B[ef]C[Black's intention seems to be to build the left side.]
;W[hd]LB[dj:A]C[I decide to go ahead and hane in order to raise my structure a bit and give me some potential in the center later on. However, this is small and I should have taken the bigger point at A since my group was already secure.]
;B[dj]C[Black ignores and takes a bit point.]
;W[cn]C[Since Black ignored my approach move on the bottom left, I decided to punish it with a double approach while ruining the left hand side.]
;B[fp]C[This attach move signals an intention to give Black thickness towards the left.]
;W[en]C[I had no intentions of going with Black's plan. Remember, the F3 stone is a probing stone and is not very useful in terms of the whole board.]
;B[co]C[This kick seemed odd.]
;W[cq]C[So I decided to poke at the shape and see what Black wanted to do.]
;B[dq]
;W[bo]C[Hane to establish a little bit of a base.]
;B[cp]C[This connection is bad shape but it shows that Black intends on keeping the corner.]
;W[bp]C[Extend once more to make my base a little more solid.]
;B[gq]LB[bq:A]C[This was unexpected. Normal move is at A.]
;W[cr]C[So I was happy to extend and secure my group completely while taking away the corner. And don't forget that the F3 still has aji. Not dead yet!]
;B[dr]C[Black blocks to prevent me from turning at D2.]
;W[nc]C[I decide it's now bigger the top has the most potential for me, so I approach the upper right stone.]
;B[qf]C[Finally! A normal response that doesn't bewilder me! xD]
;W[kd]LB[ld:A]C[I decided to continue building my structure by raising it to the fourth line. I thought about the small knight's move at A, but didn't like the weakness it left at K16.]
;B[dm]C[Black peeps.]
;W[cm]C[I decide to ignore and establish a more secure position on the left hand side since the E6 stone is far from dead and has plenty of aji even if Black cuts it off.]
;B[dn]C[Black makes good on his threat.]
;W[cl]C[I extend for good shape while ensuring the life of my group and creating opportunity to further destroy the left side Black had worked so hard to create.]
;B[dl]LB[ck:A][nq:B]C[At this point, the shape point to take is at A, but I felt that Black's wall was becoming rather impending and held potential for a big chunk of territory if I gave him sente to approach at B. ]
;W[nq]LB[ck:A]C[So I enclosed here to try and negate some of his influence. In hindsight though, there are a lot of holes in the bottom and it probably would have been better to extend at A first. After all, this is becoming a territorial game and as long as my groups were strong around the board, I could make big invasions without much concern.]
;B[qn]C[This approach seemed odd and did not seem to work with the rest of the board.]
;W[pj]C[Since my corner stone already had an enclosure with O3, I decide to do a high 3 space pincer to complicate the game more since it seemed that Black was having trouble securing his goals properly.]
;B[rp]
;W[ql]C[This seems weird to me in hindsight. I wanted to pressure Black's group, but the shape seems a little weird to me.]
;B[qq]C[Black secures his group.]
;W[kq]C[And then I go ahead and happily extend 2 spaces while further negating the power of Black's wall.]
;B[ck]C[Now this comes back to bite me.]
;W[bk]
;B[bj]
;W[bl]C[I decided to connect solidly (though in bad shape) because it had the strongest shape to eye poking / attempts to kill me later (based on my reading at the time).]
;B[oc]C[This kick was actually pretty good since my L16 extension was not efficiently placed at K16/17.]
;W[nd]C[Nonetheless, I thought that I was getting a chance to continue building the top and felt that I could win this game at the rate I was going.]
;B[qi]C[Black takes away White's base.]
;W[pn]C[Here is an example of attaching to a strong group (because it's already alive) to gain more strength.]
;B[pm]C[Black wants to fight!]
;W[qm]C[White is happy to cut.]
;B[po]
;W[on]C[Naturally I had to extend.]
;B[qo]
;W[ol]C[Played here for shape point and prevent my groups from getting split apart and attacked.]
;B[oo]
;W[nn]C[Extended once more to prevent a sente hande at O6.]
;B[no]C[At this point, I didn't think any of my groups were in danger, so my question was: Where's the biggest point on the board?]
;W[in]TR[jj][jk][il][im][hn][ho][hp][gq]C[I felt that Black still had the most territory potential in this area, so I played a reduction move that was right on the border of Black's groups.]
;B[mq]C[Black tries to capitalize on his thickness by attacking my bottom group.]
;W[mp]C[Since I wasn't planning on making many points there anyway, this does not bother me. As long as the entire group doesn't die, I'm not concerned.]
;B[oq]C[This clamp was interesting by Black, but I was happy to give him the corner since he was overconcentrated anyways.]
;W[mr]C[So I secure my group with this atari.]
;B[mo]
;W[iq]C[And then to further establish a base while giving my J6 stone some support, I chose this simple one space jump.]
;B[gn]C[Black tries to protect his territory now, but look how overconcentrated he is. ]
;W[hm]C[This move seems a bit slow at the moment, but my idea at the time was to press him down and then work towards isolating the tengen (K10) stone.]
;B[gm]
;W[hl]C[Extend to further impede on his territory.]
;B[bd]C[Black's tenuki here isn't bad and in fact this is pretty big.]
;W[pg]C[But I didn't want to end in gote to I aimed at possibly making a chunk of center territory.]
;B[qg]
;W[pi]C[Continue sealing Black from the center.]
;B[ph]
;W[oh]
;B[qh]
;W[hj]C[One-point jump to cut off the tengen stone and also intrude on Black's left territory.]
;B[nf]
;W[og]C[Though it seems small, connecting here gave me a possibiliy to cut off the O14 stone and also gave me more thickness for developing the center.]
;B[oe]
;W[ob]C[This move seems contrarty to my plan, but my thought was to reduce the corner a bit in sente.]
;B[pb]
;W[od]
;B[pc]
;W[mn]C[With this move, the center area starts to take some shape.]
;B[ko]
;W[ln]C[Extend to take aways the shape point while continuing to build the center.]
;B[io]
;W[kn]C[Once more!]
;B[hh]
;W[ii]C[Easy decision. Cut!]
;B[ih]
;W[ji]C[Help myself to some easy center territory? Don't mind if I do!]
;B[kh]
;W[ki]
;B[lg]
;W[mh]C[And with this, my center area is pretty much secure.]
;B[mb]C[This was Black's best move of the entire game (in my opinion). Didn't see it coming.]
;W[nb]
;B[ld]C[Very nice follow up.]
;W[lc]C[I try my best to salvage the situation.]
;B[kc]C[The cross-cut is correct to complicate the situation.]
;W[le]C[I wanted to save my O18 group, so I chose this atari.]
;B[lb]
;W[md]C[Bad shape, but I needed my liberties for the upcoming fight I saw.]
;B[jc]
;W[ib]C[Here I'm dead set on killing the group.]
;B[jd]C[Black's turn here worried me.]
;W[je]LB[ie:A]C[I obligingly blocked since I had committed to killing his group, but I was worried about the hane at A. See the variation at move 109.]
(;B[cc]C[Black takes the biggest point.]
;W[dc]C[I now must block to keep a bit of my top territory.]
;B[gi]C[Black tries to seal off his left hand territory.]
;W[fk]C[I got ahead and further intrude on the left side. (Can you see how the wall was incredibly inefficient?)]
;B[ek]
;W[fj]C[Basic extension to poke into Black's territory while strengthening my connections.]
;B[ei]
;W[ge]C[I decide that this is the biggest move since it helps me reduce Black's center potential.]
;B[cs]C[This worried me for a moment, but based on my reading, I couldn't die from one move. (I'd lose two stones, but I thought the sente would be worth more).]
;W[gr]C[See how that aji is a pain? Black spent like 4 stones trying to silence it, still not dead!]
;B[fr]

;B[be]
;W[df]

;B[cg]
;W[or]C[Reducing the corner.]
;B[pq]
;W[np]
;B[op]
;W[rj]C[Reducing the right hand side.]
;B[qj]
;W[qk]
;B[ri]
;W[fm]C[I played here to create a bit more aji for possible points in the K4 area.]
;B[fl]
;W[gl]
;B[el]
;W[ho]
;B[lo]
;W[go]
;B[fo]LB[fn:A]C[This move surprised me. I expected A.]
;W[fn]
;B[hp]
;W[hn]
;B[ip]
;W[jq]
;B[hr]
;W[ir]
;B[gs]
;W[ie]C[I saw potential issues here if Black tries to start a capturing race, so I eliminated the aji.]
;B[bs]
;W[ar]C[Proper shape move.]
;B[pr]
;W[ff]C[Further reducing Black.]
;B[fg]
;W[gg]
;B[fh]
;W[ee]

;W[ig]
;B[hg]

;B[mf]
;W[gh]
;B[fi]
;W[hi]
;B[rk]
;W[rl]
;B[sj]
;W[br]C[This seems small, but is pretty big since there are some weaknesses in my shape if I am not careful.]
;B[sn]
;W[cb]C[Biggest point on the board left I believe.]
;B[bb]
;W[cd]
;B[bc]
;W[db]C[Strong connection that does not give Black any sente endgame plays on the top.]

;B[sm]
;W[kf]
;B[ds]
;W[ej]
;B[of]
;W[ni]C[This was probably not necessary, but I didn't want to lose the game because of one endgame mistake (and I was quite sure I was ahead by a decent amount).]
;B[jf]
;W[lf]
;B[as]
;W[aq]C[Another move that was not necessary, but didn't want to deal with that complication.]
;B[]
;W[]C[We passed here.]
;B[kp]C[But the scoring was counting points that weren't points like D9. So we resumed play.]
;W[em]
;B[dk]
;W[]
;B[]C[And with that, I won by 51.5 points. ])
(;B[ie]
;W[id]C[Potential capturing race, although I think I would be ahead.]))
