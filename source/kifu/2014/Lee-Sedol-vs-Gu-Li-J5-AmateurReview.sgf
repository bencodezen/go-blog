PW[Gu Li]PB[Lee Sedol]WR[9d]BR[9d]DT[2014-05-25]EV[MLily Gu vs Lee Jubango]RO[Game 5]PC[Shangri-La, Yunnan, China]SO[http://gogameguru.com/]RE[B+Resign]
;B[pd]C[Star point. Flexible first move.]
;W[dd]C[Opposing star point that opens up cross-fuseki possibility and maintains balance on the board.]
;B[pq]C[3-4 komoku that now gives the game some direction. Black is emphasizing the bottom.]
;W[dp]C[White sets up ninrensei (double star) formation in anticipation of a possible Chinese opening.]
;B[qk]C[The low Chinese opening makes another appearance!]
;W[fq]C[Though it seems slow, White's small knight move here serves to negate the growth potential of the bottom area and is a common move that aims to counter the Chinese opening.]
;B[nc]LB[jd:A][qf:B]C[This surprised me since the Chinese opening normally aims for big and fast development in order to invite fighting with a move like A (K16) instead. 

This move however, seems to aim at reducing the top area's potential while removing White's approach move on the top and offering White the approach around B (R14) which would be good for Black.]
;W[fc]C[This also surprised me for a moment, but then I remembered that the general counter strategy to the Chinese opening is to play calmly and avoid fighting. So White encloses his corner while also limiting Black's potential to expand on the top. Very calm so far!]
;B[cj]LB[ch:A][cl:B]C[Black plays the standard move for splitting the side.

Question: Which side would it make more sense for White to approach from: A (C12) or B (C8)?]
;W[cl]LB[cf:A][cg:B]TR[pq]C[Correct. White wants to strengthen this bottom area to prevent Black from getting an opportunity to utilize the Q3 stone (triangle) to potentially grow his moyo.

Question: Should Black extend to A (C14) or B (C13)?]
(;B[cf]C[Correct. Because White is strong in this area, Black wants to keep his shape light and flexible while also preventing White from getting any very obvious beneficial moves. 

To see what I mean, go back to Move 10 and click on C13.]
;W[mp]LB[po:A][jp:B]C[This is a normal approach move against the Chinese opening. It asks Black whether or not he wants to enclose the corner at A (Q5) or start a fight with B (K4). 

Which one would you do?]
;B[po]LB[jp:B]TR[fq]C[Black chose to enclose the corner, which is the better answer of the two. The reason for this is because a pincer at B (K4) will end up creating a weak group for Black in an area where White is strong since White already has the F3 stone.]
;W[jp]LB[jp:B][fq:A]C[White makes a 4th line two space extension here in order to maintain balance between the A (F3) and B (K4) stones.]
;B[ej]LB[ch:A]C[Black's jump here limits the potential for White's bottom left moyo while also providing some defense against the invasion at A (C12).]
;W[re]C[White invades on the lower right to probe Black's intentions.]
;B[qd]C[Black chooses the solid iron pillar to protect the corner.]
;W[qh]LB[re:A]C[White makes a large knight move to raise his position while maintaing a light shape in case White needs to sacrifice the A (S15) stone.]
;B[oh]C[The cap here is the strongest attack since it surrounds the White group.]
;W[pj]LB[qi:A]C[White's knight's move here is consistent with White's light shape that invites fighting if Black should try to cut at A (R11).]
;B[pk]C[Black's lower right side is still far from solid, so Black extends to (1) start solidifying it, (2) prevent White from breaking into it, and (3) still keep White weak.]
;W[qj]LB[oj:A][rj:B]C[White descends to give his group a base and some stability.

Question: Which hane should Black make: A (P10) or B (S10)?]
(;B[oj]LB[rj:B]C[Correct. The hane towards the center is what strong players almost always go for because it has much greater potential for use later on (as opposed to hane on the bottom at B (S10)).

To see what I mean, go back to Move 22 and click on S10.]
;W[rk]C[White gets the hane on the second line.]
;B[rl]C[Black blocks.]
;W[rj]C[White connects solidly.]
;B[qm]C[And Black protects his cutting point while further solidifying the lower right side. And though you might protest that Black lost some territory on the lower right by not hane'ing at S10 earlier, what you need to realize is that the White group is almost sealed in now which means it has little potential for use later on in the game.]
;W[qf]C[Though it seems slow, this move is necessary for White to make living shape.]
;B[hc]TR[fc][dd]C[Black uses his sente to strongly approach the F17 group (triangle) and threaten to turn it into a weak group.]
;W[of]LB[cc:A][df:B]TR[re][qf][qh][pj][qj][rj][rk]C[White ignores Black because he is looking at the miai of A (C17) and B (D14) if Black tries to attack the group. 

Though it might be hard to realize during an actual game, this jump here is important since it prevents Black from completely sealing in the R14 group (triangle) and reduces Black's potential in the center.]
;B[bd]TR[fc][dd]C[Black slides to weaken the F17 stones (triangle).]
;W[cc]LB[bc:A][df:B]C[White stabilizes his group by taking the 3-3 point while looking at a miai for A (B17) and B (D14).]
;B[mf]C[Black caps to try and seal in White from the center.]
;W[df]C[With Black's center potential growing, White goes ahead and takes the attachments to gain strength and limit Black's center.]
;B[dg]C[When attach, hane!]
;W[ef]LB[jc:B][cg:A]C[White extends to keep his stones clearly connected and threaten the cut at A (C13) or the invasion at or around B (K17).]
;B[jd]C[Black's top area is important since Black would be behind if White destroyed this area, so Black defends it with the knight's move while also adding some growth potential since the framework was risen to the 4th line.]
;W[ce]LB[be:A][cg:B]C[White makes the tiger's mouth to further strengthen his group and threaten to take a decent piece of corner territory with a move like A (B15) or B (C13).]
;B[cn]C[However, Black does not have time to worry about the corner since White lower left moyo is getting too large. So he makes this very bold invasion.]
;W[dn]LB[cl:A][dp:B]C[White attaches on top. Standard move to try connecting the A (C8) and B (D4) stones.]
;B[do]C[Black wedges.]
;W[eo]C[White ataris from the outside to maintain his moyo potential.]
;B[co]C[Black connects solidly.]
;W[cp]C[White descends from this direction to protect his corner territory while removing a liberty.]
;B[bp]C[Black's hane here is to be expected in order to reduce some of White's corner.]
;W[bq]C[White blocks to protect.]
;B[ep]C[But then this cut completely caught me off guard. A complicated fight was about to begin!]
;W[bo]TR[bp]C[White chooses to capture the B4 stone (triangle).]
;B[fp]C[Black extends to maximize his aji for destroying this area.]
;W[eq]C[White extends solidly to keep his stones connected while protecting the bottom.]
;B[gq]C[When Black hanes here, all I could see were the multiple cutting points. Ahh!! So much fighting!!]
;W[en]C[White takes away the double atari by connecting solidly.]
;B[dq]C[Black cuts and ataris to continue making more aji in this area.]
;W[cq]C[White connects.]
;B[dr]LB[fr:A]C[Black descends and threatens to play at A (F2).]
;W[gp]C[And now White counter cuts and ataris Black.]
;B[fo]C[Black runs since White cannot catch him.]
;W[gr]C[White ataris from the bottom.]
;B[hq]LB[fr:A]C[Black extends and threatens the atari at A (F2).]
;W[fr]C[White connects solidly. And at this point, all I see are multiple Black groups cut apart and am bewildered as to what Black has planned.]
;B[ho]C[Black then plays this net which surprised me since it doesn't work, but there was clearly a plan behind this (which you'll see shortly).]
;W[iq]TR[jp][mp]C[Surprisingly White does not run out his stone with A (G5), but this seems to be because White wants to avoid his K4 group (triangle) from becoming weak and a vulnerable target for attack and thus connects with his lower left stones with this diagonal.]
;B[bn]TR[cl][dn][en][eo]C[Black now turns to cut off the E5 stones (triangle).]
;W[ap]C[White captures.]
;B[bl]C[Black connects underneath.]
;W[go]TR[gp]C[White now runs out his G4 stone (triangle).]
;B[fn]C[Black runs.]
;W[gn]C[White ataris.]
;B[fm]C[Black runs.]
;W[gm]C[White continues to follow. Though this might seem like White is "pushing from behind," White has a very strong follow up (i.e. hane) that would decimate Black's left side.]
;B[fl]C[So Black continues to extend and solidify his left side.]
;W[gl]C[White continues to follow because of the severe follow up of the hane.]
;B[fk]C[So Black must extend once more to maximize his left territory and maintain good shape.]
;W[op]C[White peeps to strengthen his stones.]
;B[pp]C[Black connects solidly and now the lower right is pretty much Black's.]
;W[cg]LB[hp:A][op:B]C[Though this move is big because it reduces the left side while gaining territory for White, I feel that A (H4) would have been more consistent with White's peep at B (P4) to try and further build White's center potential.]
;B[hp]LB[hr:A]TR[gl][gm][gn][go][gp]SQ[jp][mp][op][iq]C[Black knows better than to try and salvage the situation in the upper left, so he connects here to cut off the G8 group (triangle) and threaten to descend at A (H2) to cut off the J3 group (square).]
;W[hr]C[If there is anything a professional hates more than having a weak group, it is have TWO weak groups. So naturally White connected his stones up with this extension.]
;B[in]C[Black now must escape to prevent capture. And because White is strong around him, the diagonal is the only move.]
;W[il]TR[in][ho][hp][gq][hq]C[White must also take care of his own group and does so with this one point jump to keep pressure on the H3 stones (triangle) and hopefully gain some eye shape later on.]
;B[ko]TR[gl][il][gm][gn][go][gp]C[This knight's move seems a little loose because of the potential push and cut at A (K5) and B (L6), but it works in this situation because White cannot cut without hurting his G8 group (triangle). Click on K5 to see what I mean.

However, there is a weakness in Black's shape which you will see shortly. ]
(;W[jm]TR[gl][il][gm][gn][go][gp]C[Keeping consistent with the idea of ensuring his G8 group (triangle) does not get captured, White makes some shape with this diagonal while also threatening to cut the Black group apart.]
;B[ln]LB[jn:A][jo:B]C[Though Black could have very simply connected with a move like A (K6) or B (K5), this kosumi (i.e., diagonal) here is an excellent example of a move that helps Black maintain connection while also escaping. A beautiful and fantastic multi-purpose move.

If you don't believe me, click on either A (K6) or B (K5) to see how the diagonal prevents White from cutting.]
(;W[lm]C[White attaches to keep pressure on Black.]
;B[km]C[But Black has this wedge.]
;W[kl]C[White ataris.]
;B[kn]C[Black connects.]
;W[mn]C[White then double hanes to try putting pressure on Black.]
;B[mo]LB[mm:A]C[But Black can wedge again and threaten the double atari of A (N7).]
;W[ll]TR[gl][il][kl][ll][gm][jm][lm][gn][go][gp]C[White connects here in order to ensure his G8 group (triangle) is as strong as possible.]
;B[nn]C[Black can now atari from under.]
;W[mm]C[White is forced to connect in bad shape since giving Black a ponnuki now would be too good for Black.]
;B[np]C[Black wedges once again!]
;W[lp]LB[lo:B][nq:A]C[Instead of simply answering at A (O3) like most kyu players might do instinctively, White extends here first to strengthen his own stones while also threatening the cut at B (M5).]
;B[lo]TR[km][kn][ln][ko][lo][mo]C[Black must connect and we are witness to the infamous B2 Bomber shape in the jubango (triangle)! ]
;W[io]LB[hn:A][jn:B]C[Remember the weakness in Black's shape I mentioned earlier on Move 81, here it is now. Black cannot connect all his stones up because there is a miai of cutting points at A (H6) and B (K6).]
;B[kp]C[So Black goes for a trade.]
;W[kq]C[White blocks.]
;B[lq]C[Black cuts.]
;W[mq]C[White extends once to maximize his stone's aji.]
;B[lr]LB[kr:A][mr:B]C[Black descends to prevent capture.

Question: Which direction should White block: A (L2) or B (N2)?]
(;W[kr]C[Correct. If White had block at B (N2) instead, White would have suffered a bigger loss. Go back to Move 101 and click on N2 to see what I mean.]
;B[mr]TR[lq][lr]C[So Black must turn to prevent his M2 stones (triangle) from being captured.]
(;W[jn]C[White cuts Black off from his stones in order to prevent a sente sequence that would reduce White's territory while also potentially cutting off White's center stones. Go back to Move 103 and click on C12 to a potential sequence.]
(;B[no]LB[nq:A]C[Black connects here in order to prevent White from playing that atari at A (O3), but it seems that playing there himself would be better since it would remove the aji of the 3 white stones. However, perhaps the reason Black connected was to gain an extra point.

If you don't see why A (O3) would be a threat, go back to Move 105 and click on S16.]
;W[rc]C[White jumps in and destroys quite a few points in the corner.]
;B[rd]LB[rc:A]C[Black pushes and threatens to cut off the A (S17) stone.]
;W[sd]C[White connects under.]
;B[qb]LB[qc:A]C[The push at A (R17) might be instinctive to some players to block White from reducing further, but it is bad shape since it makes an empty triangle. Therefore, the one-point jump is the proper shape for blocking.]
;W[ke]C[White plays a nice shoulder hit to reduce Black's top area.]
;B[kd]C[Black extens to start solidifying the top.]
;W[gb]C[Though this seems slow, this diagonal is a powerful move that threatens either a heavy reduction or invasion to the top side and typically demands a response.]
;B[hb]C[Black blocks to continue solidifying the top.]
;W[bh]LB[cf:A]C[This is a multi-purpose move that (1) expands White's upper left territory, (2) reduces the aji potential of the A (C14) stone and (3) reduces Black's left territory as well.]
;B[bi]C[Black blocks White from intruding any further.]
;W[an]C[White hanes to keep reducing Black's territory.]
;B[am]C[Black's block here seems normal, but it actually exposes Black to a ko fight. However, since White seems to be leading, complicating the game is Black's best chance at reversing the game to his favor.]
;W[mc]C[White's attachment here is a brilliant preparatory move for generating threats for the impending ko fight.]
;B[md]LB[mc:A]C[Black hanes on top to keep maximum pressure on the A (N17) stone and continue solidifying the top.]
;W[cm]C[White descends to make the atari.]
;B[ao]C[And now the ko fight begins!]
;W[nd]LB[mc:A]C[With White's crosscut now, you can see the value of attaching at A (N17) prior to starting the ko fight since there are so many things that White can do on the top now.]
;B[bp]C[Black realized that simply responding would not be adequate, so he ignores to increase the size of the ko battle but threatening to take the corner.]
;W[ld]C[White ataris from the top.]
;B[me]C[Black cannot give a ponnuki since the benefit for White would be too great and has to connect.]
;W[bo]C[White takes the ko.]
;B[jk]LB[jl:A]C[Black threatens to cut at A (K8).]
;W[lc]LB[jl:A]C[White connects to destroy Black's top territory, but the general consensus right now is that White should have answered Black's threat to cut at A (K8).]
;B[nb]C[Black descends down to secure his group.]
;W[le]C[White connects to prevent from being split into two groups.]
;B[bp]C[Black resumes the ko fight.]
;W[if]TR[hb][hc][jd][kd]C[White plays the knight move which attacks the H18 stones (triangle).]
;B[aq]C[Much to my surprise, Black ends the ko and decides to make a trade. ]
;W[od]C[White extends to connect back to his stones and split the two Black groups apart.]
;B[oc]LB[oe:A]TR[nb][qb][nc][oc][pd][qd]C[Though an empty triangle, it works in this case because it (1) threatens the atari at A (P15) and (2) helps make eye shape for the R18 group (triangle). ]
;W[nf]TR[md][me][mf]C[White makes the bamboo joint to (1) ensure his connection and (2) put pressure on the N16 group (triangle) by removing a liberty.]
;B[jl]TR[kl][ll][lm][mm][mn]C[Black now follows through on his threat earlier and cuts off the M8 group (triangle).]
;W[nj]C[White clamps here to poke at Black's shape and hopefully find some aji to prevent the center territory from becoming too big.]
;B[oi]C[Black connects solidly in an effort to maximize his territory in the center.]
;W[rb]TR[nb][qb][nc][oc][pd][qd][rd]C[White decides to return to the corner and threaten to kill off the O18 group (triangle), but this is considered questionable as the center territory is quite big at the moment.]
;B[lg]LB[mj:A]C[Though it seems like Black is simply escaping with this kosumi (i.e., diagonal), this is a great move that is multi-purpose: (1) Helps Black escape. (2) Enlarges the center territory around A (N10) and (3) Aims to use the aji on top for future shenanigans.]
;W[pb]TR[nb][qb][nc][oc][pd][qd][rd]C[White spends another move to remove any possibility of the O18 group (triangle) coming alive.]
;B[je]TR[hb][hc][jd][kd][je]C[Black's push here might seem like an overplay here since the H18 stones (triangle) have no chance of living, but Black has a plan in mind!]
;W[jf]C[White blocks to prevent Black from escaping into the center.]
;B[kf]C[And then Black cuts in order to use the aji of his top stones as much as possible.]
(;W[kb]C[White decides to play the kosumi to keep the Black groups separated, but it's hard to understand why White didn't simply atari at M14 instead of playing inside. 

To see what I mean, go back to Move 145 and click on M14.]
;B[ng]C[Black now has an opportunity to protect his cutting points and further expand his center territory.]
;W[mb]TR[nb][qb][nc][pd][qd][rd]C[White descends to keep maximum pressure on the O18 group (triangle) while also ensuring Black is not able to start a capturing race at the top (which would be a disaster for White).]
;B[qe]LB[pf:A][rf:B]C[Another empty triangle, but again this is a good move because it (1) threatens the hane at A (Q14) and creates aji for later on (i.e., B (S14)).

To see why A (Q14) is a threat, click on S13.]
(;W[pe]TR[nb][qb][nc][oc][pd][qd][rd][qe]C[White sees the threat and protects with good shape and keeping maximum pressure on the O18 group (triangle).]
;B[gc]LB[fb:A]C[Black's turn here threatens the atari at A (F18) which would start to settle his stones.]
;W[fb]TR[hb][gc][hc][jd][kd][je]C[White connects solidly to keep the H18 stones (triangle) weak.]
;B[gf]TR[if][jf]C[Black then plays this beautiful two space jump which also cuts off the J14 stones (triangle) and gives Black a chance at rescuing his top stones.]
;W[mh]LB[lf:A][mg:B]C[White peeps at Black's shape and threatens to exploit the cutting points of either A (M14) or B (N13).]
;B[lf]LB[mg:B]TR[kb][mb][lc][mc][ld][ke][le]C[Though I might have played B (N13) myself, Black's reason to connect here most likely dealt with removing a liberty from the N18 group (triangle).]
;W[ji]TR[md][me][kf][lf][mf][lg]SQ[jk][jl]C[White plays his own two space jump which simultaneously threatens the M13 group (triangle) and the K9 stones (square).]
;B[lh]C[The M14 stones are more important, so Black naturally helps them first.]
;W[pc]TR[kb][mb][lc][mc][ld][ke][le]C[Though I can't see the impending threat on the upper right, White must have seen some impending danger involving the N18 group (triangle) and thus secures all of his stones with this cut.]
;B[ih]C[Black peeps at the two space connection.]
;W[ii]LB[jh:A]TR[jk][jl]C[Many players might have considered playing at A (K12), but you have to understand that it would only make White heavy in an area where Black is strong. As a result, extending to the side like this is the best way to resist since it gains some shape in relation to the rest of the White stones in the bottom center and also aims at the K9 stones (triangle).]
;B[jo]LB[hn:A][ip:B]TR[jm][jn]SQ[ho][hp][gq][hq]C[Black's response here and timing is absolutely brilliant. In case you haven't noticed, Black's move here is a double atari that threatens to either capture the K7 stones (triangle) or save the H5 stones (square). 

Question: How should White defend: A (H6) or B (J4)?]
(;W[hn]LB[ip:B]TR[ho][hp][gq][hq]C[Correct. This lets White end in sente and since the H5 stones (square) are captured via snapback. If you can't see why B (J4) is wrong, go back to Move 161 and click on J4.]
;B[im]TR[jk][jl]C[Black captures the two stones and his K9 stones (triangle) are now strong and safe.]
;W[hh]TR[if][jf][ii][ji]SQ[hb][gc][hc][jd][kd][je][gf]C[White hanes to strengthen his K14 stones (triangle) and prepare to cut off the H17 stones (square).]
;B[fg]C[Black cannot let White take the entire top side, so he runs with this solid kosumi.]
;W[he]C[White peeps at Black's two space jump.]
;B[ge]C[Black extends to threaten to connect.]
;W[jh]LB[kj:A]C[White firmly captures the J12 stone (triangle) while also threatening to significantly reduce Black's center territory with a move like A (L10).]
;B[kj]C[So Black takes the key move first to ensure White cannot invade/reduce this area easily.]
;W[eg]LB[dg:A]TR[hb][gc][hc][jd][kd][ge][je][gf][fg]C[White's turn here looks like a turn to capture the A (D13) stone, but it's main objective is to threaten to cut off the entire H18 group (triangle).]
;B[fh]C[Black extends solidly to connect up with the rest of his stones.]
;W[gd]C[White now must cut to still salvage some territory on the top.]
;B[ne]C[Black ataris here to reduce White's points and threatens to save his corner group.]
;W[oe]C[White connects.]

(;B[rj]C[I noticed that a lot of kyu players tend to play this hane on the second line. Perhaps the idea is to protect the bottom right territory.]

;B[rk]C[And then Black will most likely connect to maintain consistency with that idea.]
;W[oj]C[And now White can extend into the center and cause future shenanigans if desired. this is successful for White.]))
(;B[cg]C[Though many players might instinctively extend here to take the standard "two-space extension" base, this is the wrong answer because...]
;W[ce]LB[bh:A][ch:C][bi:B][ci:D]TR[ce][cl]C[White can take important point that practically solidifies the corner territory while creating the opportunity to harrass the Black group because it is surrounded on both sides by the triangle stones (C15 and C8) which allows for invasion around A (B12), B (B11), C (C12), and D (C11). 

This leaves a lot of bad aji for Black to worry about later on and is thus judged to be good for White because White gets territory and potential to attack a weak group later on while Black gets an unstable base and a potential headache later on.]))
