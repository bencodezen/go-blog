;B[pd]C["A 5 dan," I thought, "This'll be interesting!" Keep in mind though, he didn't have any idea how strong I was. ]
;W[dp]
;B[qp]C[Setting up for my favorite opening as Black.]
;W[dd]
;B[fq]
;W[ip]C[Kevin later told me he dislikes letting his opponent get the micro-chinese. So naturally, he pincered.]
;B[nq]C[I enclosed the corner like I normally do.]
;W[fp]C[With Kevin's attachment here, I felt I needed to respond lest I give him too much territory early on.]
;B[cq]LB[gp:A]C[So I chose to dive in, but Kevin said that A was a possibility.]
;W[eq]
;B[cp]
;W[cn]C[This here was apparently an overplay on his part, but at the time, I panicked a little bit since I already felt like I was sealed in.]
;B[co]LB[er:A]C[This bump is okay according to Kevin (provided I know the follow up at A).]
;W[dn]
;B[er]C[Fortunately, I knew better than to leave my group alone.]
;W[fr]LB[fq:B][dr:A]C[Later on, Kevin mentioned that A was an option to leave the aji of B.]
;B[dq]C[But this wasn't necessarily bad sincei t ensure my group doesn't die.]
;W[gq]C[So while White seems really thick right now, Kevin said that White is actually pretty inefficient right now since he has so many stones in the F3 area (and Black already has the O3 stone negating a lot of that influence.]
;B[fc]LB[ds:A]C[Kevin told me he was very surprised by this move. He was expecting me to protect on the bottom with something like A. HIs (almost) exact words were, "When he played here and attacked my corner, I was like oh my gosh!"]
;W[cf]
;B[jd]C[Typical of me, I decided to build a framework.]
;W[qj]C[Whie naturally splits the right side.]
;B[pk]C[This was a move I learned from frozensoul. I was trying to be aggressive. Haha.]
;W[qk]
;B[ql]LB[pl:A]C[This hane seems aggressive and taunts White to cut at A, but it's actually a trap.]
;W[rl]LB[qm:A]C[Being the 5 dan he is, he deftly avoids it. And at this point, I forgot how I should've played, but I thought about A (which is the correct move)]
;B[qg]C[But I got a little greedy and thought it best to work on my top side and give him the free atari.]
;W[qm]
;B[pl]
;W[pj]C[This is the correct direction for White to move because it prevents Black from flattening him later on.]
;B[pm]C[Naturally I had to extend.]
;W[qn]
;B[pn]
;W[qo]
;B[po]C[This was necessary to permanently seal him in and keep my stones connected.]
;W[rp]
;B[rq]C[The double hane is the only response.]
;W[ro]
;B[qq]C[Connect solidly.]
;W[qc]C[White took his sente to take away my corner.]
;B[pc]C[Block from the wider side.]
;W[qd]
;B[qe]
;W[re]
;B[rf]
;W[pe]C[Normal joseki sequence.]
;B[qf]
;W[pb]C[And then I go and royally screw it up...]
;B[oe]LB[ob:A]C[Correct move is A. I'm not sure why I panicked and tried to capture the Q15 stone instead.]
;W[oc]C[He immediately takes advantage of my mistake.]
;B[od]
;W[nc]
;B[lc]LB[ob:A][qb:B]C[I decide to try and give my marked group an anchor in case he tries to attack it later. (And I was also staring at the A/B double cut aji).]
;W[rd]LB[nb:A]C[The proper move for White was acutally A, but Kevin thought he could get away with this move.]
;B[qb]C[When I cut here a few seconds later (with little hesitation), Kevin told me he was surprised and knew instantly that I was no push-over. Haha.]
;W[rb]
;B[ob]
;W[qa]
;B[nb]C[Yayy.... Black gets his thickness back and still has a nice prospect for the top.]
;W[db]C[White protects his corner.]
;B[fe]C[I decide to elevate my framework.]
;W[he]LB[hd:A]C[This was an interesting invasion by Kevin. I thought about passively connecting at A (which was what he expected), but that wouldn't do at all.]
;B[gg]C[This is the most surprising move of the entire game (according to Kevin). He said that a 3 kyu would not play this move and it was a "dan level move." Needless to say I was pretty happy to hear that.]
;W[je]
;B[id]LB[if:A]C[I thought that this would be the best way to attack while gaining 4th line profit, but Kevin made a good point later that probably could have played at A instead.]
;W[hg]
;B[hh]C[I hane'd in order to keep pressure on White.]
;W[ih]
;B[hf]C[I atari'd from this direction because I wanted to keep my stones together while making him heavy.]
;W[ig]
;B[if]C[And with some reading, I realized I could push through and cut him apart. ]
;W[gh]
;B[hi]
;W[ii]C[At this point, I'm worried that I might have made a mistake in extending with H11 (since I thought it might be an unimportant group. But I was severely mistaken...]
;B[gf]C[This is my losing move. Apparently up to this point, Kevin said I was leading by a little bit.]
;W[fh]TR[hh][hi]C[Letting White get this pretty much meant my marked group was dead.]
;B[il]C[I try to play lightly and discard the stones while reducing White's framework.]
;W[hj]C[But being the dan player he is, Kevin just swallowed the stones and made my life so much more difficult.]
;B[gl]C[I try to salvage what I can and continue trying to reduce White's moyo.]
;W[fk]C[This shoulder hit was very effective and I had no idea what else I could do.]
;B[eg]TR[hh][hi]C[Still feeling sad I lost my two stones, I try to evoke a response from White here.]
;W[kl]C[But White does a simple cap and I'm in BIG trouble.]
;B[kk]C[I try to attach to make shape.]
;W[lk]
;B[jk]LB[ll:A]C[I hope that Kevin would connect at A since I'm threatning to cut.]
;W[lj]C[But White is too strong now and can seal me in. The cut at A would be useless.]
;B[jn]C[I try to escape.]
;W[lm]C[White protects his cut while still leaving me behind enemy lines.]
;B[ml]C[I try to make White heavy and in hopes of possibly counter-attacking.]
;W[ll]
;B[fl]C[Trying desperately to make living shape.]
;W[ek]
;B[hn]C[Continue trying to make shape.]
;W[ko]C[After this, I'm practically done...]
;B[fn]C[I try to struggle a bit more...]
;W[go]C[But it's useless, and I resign here. =)])
