;B[pd]BL[1794.398]C[Normal 4-4 opening move.]
;W[dd]WL[1798.038]C[White plays on the opposing corner and opens up the possibility for a cross-fuseki.]
;B[qp]BL[1790.513]C[This move should not be a surprise to most of you anymore.]
;W[dq]WL[1796.055]LB[dp:A]C[This move is interesting because it takes away the probe that I normally do if White plays the start point at A (D4). This 3-4's strong side is automatically facing my weak side.]
;B[oq]BL[1776.557]C[So to prevent an easy approach move where White has shown intentions on possibly building later, I decide on the small knight's enclosure to form a stronger group that helps to negate the potential of the bottom.]
;W[qf]WL[1789.34]LB[nc:A]C[In my personal opinion, White's approach here is from the incorrect direction since it's not from the "wider side." In other words, it seems like A (O17) is the better side to approach from. However, this is probably due to my philosophy of trying to have my stones work together as much as possible (since the approach move at A could possibly synergize with the D16 stone).

Question: Should Black pincer or calmly response with a move like A (O17)?]
;B[qh]BL[1755.632]LB[nc:A]C[While A (O17) is not technically a "bad" move, we have to consider board as a whole. If you notice the lower right, you'll recall that we made an enclosure here which means our greatest potential for territory is on the right side. As a result, the pincer does a better job working towards that goal.]
;W[qc]WL[1784.336]LB[pc:A][qd:B]C[White dives in for safety. 

Question: Which direction should Black block? A (Q17) or B (R16)?]
;B[qd]BL[1741.781]C[Correct. Black has no potential on the top side and thus this side is the correct side to block. In addition, since the right side has the most emphasis for Black at the moment, this also synergizes with that concept.]
;W[pc]WL[1783.256]C[White extends so that he can get some territory and make a base.]
;B[od]BL[1737.987]LB[oc:A]C[I've reviewed this before so I'll leave it off for this game, but don't forget that Black cannot hane at A (P17) in this joseki with the one spaced pincer --> 3-3 invasion. ]
;W[rd]WL[1782.255]C[White threatens to connect.]
;B[re]BL[1736.891]C[Black blocks.]
;W[rc]WL[1781.233]C[White connects.]
;B[qe]BL[1734.57]C[Black connects to protect the cutting point.]
;W[nc]WL[1780.199]LB[me:A]C[White jumps once to prevent Black from sealing him in. At this point though, Black has a choice to either tenuki or play at A (N15).]
;B[me]BL[1730.42]LB[jq:A]C[White typically responds to Black with A (N17), but it's certainly not a critical move at the moment. And in hindsight, I really think that I should have just played the big point at A (K3) instead of the knight's move (N15).]
;W[jq]WL[1771.843]C[White was smart to ignore and take the big point.]
;B[do]BL[1719.093]C[At this point, all of my stones were on the right side, so I wanted to spread out a bit around the board before focusing on building the right again.]
;W[fp]WL[1767.828]C[This is a standard response for building the bottom.]
;B[cq]BL[1704.831]C[Black attaches to gain a base.]
;W[cr]WL[1765.756]C[White hane prevents Black from getting a base easily.]
;B[cp]BL[1702.877]C[Black pulls back to stay connected.]
;W[mq]WL[1761.423]C[White's tenuki here is nice since it flattens out Black's right side a bit. ]
;B[mp]BL[1690.624]C[But since it was on the third line, and the group (N3 and K3) was already strong, I wanted to attach to build thickness and grow the right.]
;W[lp]WL[1757.838]C[White hanes at predicted to prevent me from cutting his two space connection.]
;B[mo]BL[1688.576]C[I extend up to build the right side.]
;W[br]WL[1755.174]C[White's extension here is to remove one of Black's miai for a base.]
;B[cl]BL[1664.785]C[I take the calm large knight extension to settle.]
;W[nq]WL[1753.646]C[White bumps here and takes a vital point in the shape. Would have been much nicer if I could have gotten this point.]
;B[oo]BL[1656.376]LB[np:A]C[I decide to one space jump maintain good shape and protect from the push and cut at A (O4).]
;W[or]WL[1750.15]C[White threatens to take away Black's corner.]
;B[lo]BL[1644.209]C[But the right side seemed much bigger to me, so I chose to abandon the corner and turn here for a very thick and strong move.]
;W[pq]WL[1744.954]C[I debated ignoring White's atari here since I had given up the corner.]
;B[op]BL[1623.658]C[But I decided that the resulting ponnuki would expose a lot of cutting points and aji in my shape, so I wanted to keep solid with the bamboo joint.]
;W[qq]WL[1743.693]LB[pp:B][rp:A]C[When White played here, I debated played A (S4) at first, but thought the push and cut at B (Q4) would be problematic later on.]
;B[ro]BL[1560.617]C[So I chose this diagonal for shape instead.]
;W[cf]WL[1733.472]C[White's small knight's move here seemed rather passive to me. I know that it prevents an approach move by Black, but there is huge moyo growing on the right that needs to be dealt with.]
;B[fc]BL[1536.694]C[Thought I had the option of growing the right side, I decided to appraoch the corner since I knew that White was ahead in terms of cash and so I wanted to limit his corner potential.]
;W[ic]WL[1717.69]C[Not sure why White chose the two-space pincer, seems a little weak in terms of usefulness.]
;B[cc]BL[1526.449]C[I decided to simply dive into the corner for a little bit of cash.]
;W[dc]WL[1715.345]C[White is correct to block on this side.]
;B[db]BL[1522.618]LB[eb:A]C[When I hane'd here, I thought White would block at A (E18).]
;W[cd]WL[1712.57]C[White decides to switch directions in this case, which ends up being a bad idea. I'll explain in a little bit.]
;B[bb]BL[1518.001]C[This tiger's mouth might seem weird and low to some players, but it's the correct move since it protects the cutting point at C18 and E18.]
;W[bc]WL[1711.185]C[And even though White gets this atari.]
;B[cb]BL[1516.321]TR[ic]C[Black gets to solidify and lives with relative ease. In addition, while Black's profit seems small, you should notice that the J17 stone is now all alone and not being very useful. So the switch in direction hurts the efficiency of White's stones, which will show to have value to Black later on in the game.]
;W[ci]WL[1706.917]C[This move probably should have made me more worried that I was at the time. After all, I was undercut by the B2 stone already and now the C11 stone took away my two space extension in case I needed a better base. ]
;B[mc]BL[1496.892]C[I clearly felt safe, because next I decide to punish White for ignoring my N14 move and seal him in while cutting off the J17 stone.]
;W[mb]WL[1702.371]C[White tries to prevent from being sealed in and connect to the J17 stone.]
;B[lc]BL[1487.956]C[I extend to keep him on the second line.]
;W[lb]WL[1700.447]C[White extends again. And remember, Black is happy to let White crawl along the second line (the line of defeat).]
;B[oc]BL[1480.384]C[I decide to take the sente push.]
;W[ob]WL[1699.315]C[White blocks.]
;B[nd]BL[1479.027]C[And I fix up my shape with this atari (which I was hoping would be sente.]
;W[nb]WL[1698.237]C[White connects! Woot! And not look at my right side! So grand!]
;B[kc]BL[1469.824]C[And then I make a greedy move and think that White will try to connect his group with K18 or L18.]
;W[pj]WL[1690.153]LB[pi:B][oj:A][qj:C][pk:D]C[White is not blind, and decides to launch a full scale invasion. And for most players, this is probably the most dreaded moment of moyo play. Because after all, this is where you'll have to prove that White made a mistake by invading your turf. 

Question: There are four directions Black can attack White from, which is best?]
;B[nj]BL[1465.331]C[Based on my understanding of attack, teh cap here is the most severe move since White cannot run out into the center and must be forced to try and make life in an area which is incredibly cramped.]
;W[nk]WL[1687.218]LB[mk:A][ok:B]C[When White attached here, I was faced with an problem. Hane at A (N9) or B (P9)?]
;B[mk]BL[1428.138]LB[ok:B]C[To be honest, I think that this is probably the incorrect move since B (P9) would keep the White stones separated (which is preciaely whaty ou want since something is definitely going to die.]
;W[mj]WL[1685.035]C[White cross-cuts to try and complicate matters.]
;B[ni]BL[1413.825]C[I extend in order to prevent myself from unnecessarily strengthening my opponent.]
;W[qn]WL[1682.733]LB[pp:A]C[This is a nice move by White here. It pokes at Black's shape and threatens to push and cut at A (Q4)]
;B[qo]BL[1346.738]C[And while this may have pained me to make bad shape like this, I felt this was the only way to keep pressure on White.]
;W[ml]WL[1672.689]C[White ataris here to try and make some shape.]
;B[lk]BL[1344.396]C[Naturally I extend.]
;W[qi]WL[1663.456]C[White is now trying to establish a foothold in Black's influence.]
;B[rh]BL[1298.933]LB[ri:A][rn:B]C[I descend in order to undercut White from both directions A and B. ]
;W[ph]WL[1631.85]TR[qh][rh]C[White takes this opportunity to try and make some eye shape with the tiger's mouth while threatening to connect to the R14 stone and possibly cutting off the marked Black stones.]
;B[pf]BL[1247.214]C[So I squash that idea immediately and ensure that all of my groups are connected.]
;W[ri]WL[1629.013]LB[qg:A]C[When White blocks here, I am slightly concerned with the cut at A (R13), but...]
;B[qk]BL[1186.953]C[I decided that taking a vital point was better and that White would still not be able to live just yet.]
;W[pl]WL[1621.02]C[White tries to seal in the R9 stone.]
;B[rm]BL[1173.937]C[But I had a plan for getting it out!]
;W[rn]WL[1610.868]C[White threatens to cut off the stone.]
;B[sn]BL[1168.802]C[But I connected underneath with ease.]
;W[rl]WL[1606.985]C[This is a nice clamp by White, but I was anticipating this and ready to leave the R9 stone alone since it was sitting on the vital point. In addition, I didn't think that White would be able to make two eyes.]
;B[qm]BL[1122.678]C[So the calm extension here (while threatening to connect to R9) was just the ticket!]
;W[ql]WL[1603.61]C[White must connect to have a shot at living.]
;B[ok]BL[1115.603]C[Continuing to exploire the aji of the R9 stone.]
;W[pk]WL[1559.451]C[White must prevent the connection.]
;B[nl]BL[1088.053]C[And with this simple capture, I felt that I was in good shape since I didn't see how White was going to make two eyes. 

For those stronger players, you're probably noticing that my analysis is not quite right... but don't worry, we'll get there soon.]
;W[pg]WL[1529.824]C[White threatens to connect to the R14 stone.]
;B[qg]BL[1067.617]C[I'm under the impression that White is not yet alive, so the cut was an easy decision at the time.]
;W[of]WL[1525.673]C[White exploits the remaining aji of the R14 stone with the atari.]
;B[rf]BL[1053.656]C[Simple capture removes all the aji.]
;W[mg]WL[1523.86]C[White jumps out to make some shape.]
;B[nh]BL[1023.567]C[I figured that the extension here was enouhg to poke out White's eyes and keep him dead.]
;W[ng]WL[1519.096]C[White connects.]
;B[kg]BL[1014.366]C[And then I cap him here thinking I was uber successful in owning White on the right.]
;W[rk]WL[1487.002]C[Then White plays this move... ]
;B[si]BL[967.333]C[I play here without thinking, but I'm starting to realize that White is alive...]
;W[sj]WL[1478.34]C[Rats... So much for owning the right side...]
;B[kb]BL[915.05]C[I've experienced this kind of thing in the past before, and I'm sure many other kyu players will empathize with me when I tell you that I used to feel like a complete failure. After all, all my efforts on the right side failed and I had no territory to show for it. And if I had felt worse that day, I might have even resigned.

However, you're about to see what happens what you can do when giving the kind of power that Black now has in the center.]
;W[fd]WL[1474.46]C[Now that the J17 stone is cut off from the M18 group, White is trying to connect back to it.]
;B[gd]BL[889.994]LB[bd:A]C[I decided to hane here because I'm not worried about the cross-cut since even though my marked group looks weak, I still have the option of making life by capturing a stone with A (B16).]
;W[gc]WL[1472.728]C[Sure enough, White cross-cuts.]
;B[fb]BL[882.165]TR[bb][cb][db][fb][cc][fc]C[By extending downards, I wanted to ensure that my marked group had miai for life and could connect back to the L18 group is needed. In addition, this kept the White stones very clearly separated.]
;W[ie]WL[1467.001]C[White tries to jump out and make some shape.]
;B[hd]BL[878.939]C[A simple extension was enough to poke out his eyeshape.]
;W[id]WL[1465.855]C[White connects, but now his group is kind of heavy.]
;B[gf]BL[874.806]LB[hc:A]C[Since I had a lot of power in the center, I decided not to take the easy route and connect my groups with A (H17). By jumping out into the center, I had full intentions of harrassing the group and hopefully killing it.]
;W[ig]WL[1463.513]C[White jumps.]
;B[gh]BL[871.025]C[I jump again to cut him off from running towards his allies on the left.]
;W[ii]WL[1461.663]C[White continues to run.]
;B[gj]BL[852.051]C[I continue to chase.]
;W[hc]WL[1458.218]C[White decides to turn this into a life and death battle now.]
;B[hf]BL[845.287]C[So I start by strengthening my connections.]
;W[kf]WL[1452.844]C[White is smart not to connect at A (J14) since it would only make his group heavier. This attachment here gives him some hope for eye shape.]
;B[lg]BL[825.479]C[Because my shape is a little thin in this area, I thought the extension would be best.]
;W[lf]WL[1445.412]C[White tries to connect back to his living group.]
;B[mf]BL[820.782]C[But I had no intentions of giving him easy life.]
;W[jg]WL[1443.352]TR[kg][lg]C[White bumps here to threaten to capture my two marked stones.

Question: How should Black escape with good shape?]
;B[ki]BL[808.831]TR[ig][jg][ii]C[Correct. This hits the vital point for the marked stones as well since White would love to have a stone on L11 instead.]
;W[hi]WL[1432.822]C[White threatens to cut Black apart.]
;B[gi]BL[796.816]TR[gc][hc][ic][id][ie][kf][lf][ig][jg][hi][ii]C[Thought I wasn't thrilled with my heavy shape, I knew I would have to endure if I wanted a chance at killing the White group.]
;W[kj]WL[1414.072]TR[kg][lg][ki]C[White tries to threaten capture by trying to cut off the marked stones.]
;B[li]BL[784.454]C[Bamboo joint here was enough to keep my stones connected.]
;W[jj]WL[1402.643]C[White pulls back to keep his group connect. However, I will have to say that White should have simply jumped again since the L10 stone is not important.]
;B[if]BL[779.57]C[I decide to use my forcing move now in order to further make White's shape heavier.]
;W[jf]WL[1400.613]C[White connects as he tries to save his entire group.]
;B[le]BL[767.882]LB[je:A]C[This seemed like an innocent push, but it threatens the cut at A (K15).]
;W[je]WL[1395.125]C[White patches that right up.]
;B[hh]BL[757.01]C[I used another forcing move to strengthen my own connections while threatening to cut White apart.]
;W[ji]WL[1387.555]C[White takes the solid bamboo joint.]
;B[jl]BL[745.795]C[And since White choes not to jump out, I took the opportunity to start sealing him in.]
;W[il]WL[1378.876]C[It should come to no one's surprise that White attaches.]
;B[jm]BL[732.786]LB[ik:A]C[I extend solidly since I know there is still a weakness in his connection at A (J9).]
;W[hk]WL[1359.221]C[White tries to fix his cutting point.]
;B[hj]BL[722.306]C[Again, just harrassing the group while threatening to cut at A (J9).]
;W[ik]WL[1357.126]C[White fixes his connection.]
;B[gm]BL[715.856]C[After some deliberation, I decided that I was strong enough to surroung his group and go for the kill.]
;W[hm]WL[1343.571]C[White tries to break out.]
;B[hn]BL[696.531]C[The block is obvious since I'm trying to kill him.]
;W[gl]WL[1339.25]C[White tries to create cutting points while forming a half-eye.]
;B[fm]BL[692.956]C[Calm extension seemed enough since it connected me back to my group on the left while keeping pressure on White.]
;W[fl]WL[1335.617]C[White extends.]
;B[el]BL[674.579]LB[em:A]C[When I made this hane, I read out the cut at A (E7) and saw that I had nothing to worry about. 

If you're curious what I saw, click E7.]
(;W[ek]WL[1332.34]TR[gd][hd][gf][hf][if][gh][hh][gi][gj][hj]C[When White hane's here, I am aware that my marked group is actually not alive yet.]
;B[fk]BL[665.015]C[So I decide that it is a do or die situation.]
;W[em]WL[1330.356]C[White starts to exploire my cutting points, but based on my reading, it shouldn't amount to anything.]
;B[dl]BL[662.854]C[I extend and connect.]
;W[gn]WL[1329.366]C[White ataris.]
;B[fn]BL[660.691]C[Extend.]
;W[in]WL[1328.236]C[Second atari.]
;B[go]BL[656.371]LB[im:A]C[Clean capture while threatening to cut at A (J7).]
;W[im]WL[1321.758]LB[ho:A]C[It's worth noting that it might have been a good idea for White to try for a ko at A (H5) instead.]
;B[io]BL[653.854]C[Since White didn't try for a ko though, I was happy to take the shape point at J5.]
;W[gk]WL[1317.364]C[White makes an eye in sente!]
;B[fj]BL[649.62]C[I must connect if I have any hopes of killing him.]
;W[jn]WL[1315.138]C[White tries to escape.]
;B[jo]BL[646.812]C[But resistance is futile! 

Also, if you notice, Black has gained a lot of thickness to invade the bottom. Thus another example of how chasing a group can yield profits later on.]
;W[kn]WL[1306.898]C[When White extends here, the first thing I noticed was that he was aiming to trap the marked stones with A (L8). However, some players might instinctively have saw the gap at B (L5) and connected there since it looks treacherous. However, if you do some reading, you'll see that the cut at L5 doesn't work for White (which you'll see shortly).]
;B[lm]BL[609.395]C[I make sure all my stones are connected in good shape.]
;W[jb]WL[1298.482]C[White threatens to connect back to his upper right corner group with L19.]
;B[ja]BL[600.746]C[But I was not going to budge one inch.]
;W[ia]WL[1296.647]C[White ataris to threaten to connect back to his group while hoping to make an eye.]
;B[ka]BL[598.148]C[Solid connection is necessary.

Question: Can White make an eye from this position?]
(;W[ha]WL[1279.459]C[The answer is no. White best resistance would probably have been G18, but that doesn't work. (Go back to Move 159 and click on G18 if you're curious what would happen)

(Funny thing is that White even comments during the game that this was a stupid move)]
;B[gb]BL[580.088]C[I had no intentions of complicating things, so I simple extended and kept his eye false.]
;W[ko]WL[1266.63]C[Here is the push I was talking about earlier. It looks dangerous, but...]
;B[kp]BL[574.293]LB[jp:B][lq:A]C[Black will cut off the group here and now has a miai for A (M3) and B (K4).]
;W[jp]WL[1260.647]C[White tries to cut off the cutting stone.]
;B[lq]BL[570.246]C[But Black keeps it simple and captures.]
;W[hp]WL[1246.831]LB[ho:A]TR[io][jo]C[White threatens to cut off the two marked stones at A (H5) while trying to seal off his bottom territory.]
;B[ho]BL[559.155]C[No choice but to connect.]
;W[lj]WL[1223.195]C[This move looked like it could lead to a tesuji, but based on my reading, White could not capture anything as a result of this move. The most dangerous things that came to mind is A (M12) that seems to play on the shortage of liberty situation. 

To see that variation, go to the next move at Move 169 and click on M12.]
;B[dj]BL[461.921]C[As a result, I decided to prevent a capturing race and capture the E9 stone with a net.]
(;W[bo]WL[1192.16]C[White jumps in hoping to weaken my group I guess. It is kind of presumptuous to think that White can kill Black now. ]
;B[ep]BL[437.645]C[I decide that the little piece of territory on the left wasn't too big, so I though to poke at the bottom first.]
;W[dp]WL[1185.687]TR[cp][cq]C[White gives me a choice to either save the marked stones or save the E4 stone.]
;B[eo]BL[399.198]C[I felt the bottom was bigger. ]
;W[co]WL[1180.435]C[So I was happy to give up the C3 stones.]
;B[eq]BL[396.035]C[And come waltzing into White's bottom.]
;W[dr]WL[1178.169]C[White must connect if he doesn't want to lose both the corner and the bottom.]
;B[lr]BL[383.596]TR[mq][nq][pq][qq][or]C[I decided here now to harrass the lower right group while also possibly taking the bottom section for myself.]
;W[fr]WL[1174.039]C[White wants to save his bottom stones.]
;B[fq]BL[367.75]C[So I decide to harrass them a bit.]
;W[gr]WL[1172.318]C[White extends. And at this point I know I can't really cut them off.]
;B[er]BL[363.632]C[So I just reduce White's shape a bit to keep him on his toes.]
;W[es]WL[1170.413]C[White must connect.]
;B[gq]BL[354.317]LB[hr:A]TR[fp][hp][jp][jq]C[This push is sente because it threatens the hane at A (H2) which would either capture the G2 stones if White ignores or cut off the marked White stones.]
;W[gp]WL[1167.73]C[White's connection here looks sente at first since there is a cutting point at A (F5).]
;B[hr]BL[345.959]TR[fp][gp][hp][jp][jq]C[But he's actually one liberty short of making it work, so I take the opportunity to cut off his marked stones.]
;W[ip]WL[1152.141]LB[fo:A]C[White realizes his mistake, but it's a little late since it's so obvious he's aiming for the A (F5) cut now.]
;B[fo]BL[338.364]C[So I naturally connect solidly.]
;W[fs]WL[1134.165]C[White saves his two stones, but it's rather small.]
;B[hq]BL[332.7]C[Though on the other hand, it does for Black to connect and gives sente to White.]
;W[bd]WL[1125.727]TR[bb][cb][db][fb][gb][cc][fc]C[At first glance, it seems like Whtie is tries to solidify his left territory, but in actuality, he's aiming to kill the marked Black group.]
;B[rq]BL[314.092]C[Based on my reading though, White could not kill me. To be honest, it was a bit of a risky gamble when you consider how many points are at stake, but this is part of trying to get stronger: aka not playing additional moves to live when you don't have to.]
;W[ab]WL[1122.522]C[The hane by White here seemed to be the most common sense way to try and kill Black.]
;B[ec]BL[291.002]C[But I had already counted for that scenario and played this empty triangle to give myself a miai. Can you see what I'm talking about?]
;W[ea]WL[1115.022]C[If Black played here instead, he would definitely be alive. Obviously White is trying to kill Black, so White must take away the vital point.]
;B[ed]BL[282.38]C[But I still had this move here. Haha.]
;W[fe]WL[1113.187]C[White tries to run.]
;B[ee]BL[278.518]C[But there's no where to go...]
;W[ff]WL[1111.623]C[White keeps running.]
;B[ef]BL[265.1]TR[gd][hd][gf][hf][gh][hh]C[But my group is just so thick I don't even need a net (although I will say that I was watching to make sure I didn't end up in some shortage of liberty situation with my bamboo joints).]
;W[ei]WL[1110.605]TR[cl][dl][el][fm][gm][fn][hn][do][eo][go][ho][io][jo][ep][eq][fq][gq][hq][er][hr]C[White tries to for for a hail mary, but if you analyze the groups, you'll notice that the E5 group is totally alive.]
;B[fg]BL[243.013]C[So no reason to respond to White's threat. Black is now alive on both sides and White is uber dead in the center. As a result, White resigns here since there no way for him to make a comeback.])
(;W[lh]C[This seemed dangerous at first.]
;B[kh]C[Black obviously needs to connect.]
;W[mi]C[And White could try the atari here.]
;B[mh]C[But he's short a liberty and it doesn't quite work.]))
(;W[gb]C[White tries to block.]
;B[ga]C[Black would hane.]
;W[ha]C[White's next strongest response is here and it looks like White makes an eye here.]
;B[ib]C[But Black can throw-in here.]
(;W[hb]C[White can capture.]
;B[jc]C[But then Black will falsify his eye.])
(;W[jc]C[And if you think this works...]
;B[hb]C[Black will simply capture.])))
(;W[em]C[If White cut...]
;B[en]C[I would atari from this direction.]
;W[dm]C[He would extend.]
;B[dl]C[I would prevent the atari.]
;W[gn]C[Atari.]
;B[fn]C[Connect.]
;W[in]C[Atari.]
;B[ho]C[Extend.]
;W[im]C[White would seal up his cutting point.]
;B[io]C[Turn and cut White off.]
;W[jo]C[White can try to resist.]
;B[jn]LB[go:A][jp:B]C[But Black can cut and now has a miai for A (G5) and B (K4).]))
