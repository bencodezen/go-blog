(1) I spent a lot of the game trying to kill the E9 dragon (triangle). I came really close (or at least I thought I did), but Shiu Lao Shi was able to make it live after a crazy whole board battle.

(2) I did profit decently off the attack, but believe or not, my F13 dragon (square) actually got too weak in the process and ended up dying at the end. 

When my dragon died, I resigned.])
