;B[pd]BL[1194.898]C[To be honest, for a majority of my go journey, I have to say that the 4-4 is my 1st move as Black 99% of the time because of the flexibility it allows me in choosing fuseki later on.]
;W[dp]WL[1197.929]C[By playing in the opposing diagonal corner, White prevents Black from choosing a cross-fuseki. (Not that I would have done so anyway, but just so you know. =D)]
;B[qp]BL[1192.013]C[Preparing for my favorite fuseki as Black.]
;W[ed]WL[1195.966]C[This threw me off since 5-4 is not very commonly seen. For those trying to understand the board, White is emphasizing the left side and the outside (since an invasion by Black in the corner will give White thickness towards the center.]
;B[fq]BL[1176.456]C[So I start with my standard probe.]
;W[fo]WL[1189.511]C[Again with an atypical move. However, this is not a good move since Black's F3 stone is already sitting on a vital shape point. And even if it were to be good, White would need a lot of potential on the left hand side, and this is not the case. In addition, notice that White's intentions are completely one-dimensional. This is inflexible and bad for go (especially in the beginning).]
;B[lq]BL[1127.572]C[Though not really ideal, I chose to setup the mini-Chinese since I wanted to see where White's head was at.]
;W[jj]WL[1180.98]C[Tengen? What a weird choice!]
;B[pj]BL[1120.927]C[I'll go ahead and take my double winged formation then.]
;W[nc]WL[1173.605]C[Ah. So now you want to approach my corner normally? (I have expected some crazy play at like P3 or something.]
;B[pf]BL[1114.518]C[I'll go ahead and calmly jump high to continue building my framework.]
;W[pb]WL[1155.231]C[Diving into the corner?]
;B[qc]BL[1108.873]C[No problem. I'll be happy to take sente after this.]
;W[oq]WL[1141.229]LB[lq:A]TR[pb][nc]C[Here is a good example of a bad move. Why? (1) White's getting too jealous of Black's framework and jumping into it in a terrible fashion (Notice that he's already pincered by A). (2) He is leaving his marked group for attack later on.]
;B[pq]BL[1105.094]C[Easy decision. Kick!]
;W[pr]WL[1135.61]C[You want the corner?]
;B[op]BL[1093.792]C[Sure. I'll take outside thickness for better future profit.]
;W[qq]WL[1130.123]
;B[pp]BL[1091.885]
;W[nq]WL[1126.194]
;B[np]BL[1083.389]C[Let me continue to seal you in.]
;W[mq]WL[1111.116]
;B[mp]BL[1078.322]
;W[lr]WL[1084.983]
;B[kr]BL[1061.913]C[Double hane is an easy choice since it either (1) seals him in completely or (2) takes back the corner. See variation if you want to see how I take back the corner.]
(;W[mr]WL[1077.026]
;B[kp]BL[1056.007]
;W[rq]WL[1058.778]C[I debated responding to this.]
;B[cn]BL[1020.718]C[But thought the double approach would be better.]
;W[jq]WL[1033.501]LB[kq:A]C[White expects me to connnect at A, but the bottom is not big at all and A is way too small.]
;B[dj]BL[1000.41]C[So I'm happy to take a big point while giving my stones a nice relationship on the left.]
;W[kq]WL[1021.081]
;B[lp]BL[997.3]
;W[hq]WL[992.229]C[This is an example of a kyu player trying to take small profit and capture a stone when it is not important. ]
;B[cq]BL[982.026]TR[fq]C[The marked stone has plenty of aji and is far from captured.]
;W[dq]WL[978.414]
;B[cp]BL[978.261]
;W[dl]WL[944.104]C[Again, White is being overly aggressive. ]
;B[do]BL[971.801]C[Black takes the shape point.]
;W[cr]WL[888.278]LB[br:A]C[White is probably expecting a hane at A.]
;B[ep]BL[966.275]C[But I had no plans of being distracted.]
;W[er]WL[878.836]
;B[eo]BL[945.042]TR[dp][dq][cr][er]C[I was happy to connect solidly while his marked group is not yet alive.]
;W[bo]WL[812.473]LB[co:A]C[Another overplay. White wants Black to connect at A.]
;B[bn]BL[897.238]LB[co:A]C[Calm reading will show that this way prevents White from cutting at A. See variation if you don't believe me.]
(;W[bm]WL[779.048]C[White trying for some weird shenanigans.]
;B[fr]BL[878.996]C[Now I prepare to try and kill the group.]
;W[bq]WL[749.734]C[White tries to expand his eye space.]
;B[bp]BL[865.966]C[I'm prepared for a possible ko.]
;W[br]WL[713.465]C[But he connects solidly surprisingly.]
;B[aq]BL[853.71]C[So I'm happy to reduce his eye space while reducing ko possibilities.]
;W[ar]WL[695.56]
;B[ds]BL[821.066]C[I then decide to take the vital point and force the group into ko.]
;W[ap]WL[673.165]
;B[co]BL[818.832]C[Must connect.]
;W[es]WL[605.989]C[And with this descent. I realized that I cannot kill White. ]
;B[fn]BL[674.219]C[Oh well, at least I got sente and essentially sealed his group off from the center.]
;W[fm]WL[554.369]C[White loves his overaggressive moves.]
;B[gn]BL[660.585]C[Simple extension is enough.]
;W[dh]WL[539.109]C[White tries to pincer.]
;B[cd]BL[652.402]C[Time to contest the corner.]
;W[ce]WL[526.12]C[This outside attachment was a little surprising since hte left side was far from being White's moyo. ]
;B[be]BL[632.135]
;W[cf]WL[522.515]
;B[dd]BL[623.95]C[I was happy to take the corner meanwhile.]
;W[ee]WL[507.627]
;B[eb]BL[613.455]C[Taking the shape point while starting to solidify my corner.]
;W[ec]WL[496.719]
;B[db]BL[606.547]
;W[fb]WL[478.904]
;B[bf]BL[594.9]C[Expanding my eye space.]
;W[bg]WL[451.741]C[I decided my corner was pretty safe.]
;B[me]BL[569.599]TR[pb][nc]C[So i decided to start expanding my cramework while pressuring the marked stones.]
;W[ne]WL[407.406]C[Talk about aggression!]
;B[nf]BL[562.696]
;W[md]WL[392.915]
;B[oe]BL[560.841]C[Easy choice.]
;W[le]WL[387.115]C[Fascinating! Seems like White wants to trade for hie own moyo on the top.]
;B[nd]BL[557.867]
;W[lc]WL[380.484]
;B[lf]BL[554.803]C[Too bad I'm getting really solid shape and reducing his moyo at the same time!]
;W[qn]WL[322.355]LB[rp:A]C[Not a bad invasion for White. Threatens to connect at A.]
;B[rp]BL[537.294]
;W[rj]WL[299.06]C[Weird dive. I guess White's trying to create aji in my moyo. In my opinion though, he's way too deep.]
;B[ql]BL[527.336]C[So I attack the connection between his stones.]
;W[rl]WL[289.062]
;B[qk]BL[518.92]
;W[rk]WL[284.44]C[I don't mind if he lives on the second line...]
;B[rh]BL[512.446]C[But I won't make it easy!]
;W[on]WL[233.875]C[White tries to run.]
;B[lm]BL[435.779]C[But I have no intentions of letting him get away easily.]
;W[qm]WL[219.84]C[White tries for eye space.]
;B[sm]BL[430.412]C[Monkey jump to destroy the eye!]

;W[si]WL[30]OW[5]C[Could you be more obvious?]
;B[sd]BL[251.062]

;B[mj]BL[240.786]
;W[mi]WL[30]OW[4]
;B[ni]BL[226.209]C[But I have no problem just cutting him off.]
;W[nh]WL[30]OW[4]LB[oi:A]C[This counter atari was unexpected, and instinct told me that connecting at A was a bad idea (which is what I think White was hoping for). See variation.]
(;B[nk]BL[164.642]C[But I had a better idea.]
;W[oi]WL[30]OW[4]

;W[mg]WL[30]OW[3]C[White tries to make eyes.]
;B[ng]BL[127.939]LB[oh:A]C[But this move is sente since it threatens the cut at A.]
;W[mf]WL[30]OW[3]C[White takes his sente move first.]
;B[ne]BL[99.959]
;W[lg]WL[30]OW[3]LB[oh:A]C[This was bad of White. He should have connected at A.]
;B[oh]BL[91.083]C[Though I was proud to cut him off, White can live. Do you see the tesuji?]
;W[qb]WL[30]OW[3]LB[pe:A]C[White tries to start a capturing race here, but the tesuji was actually at A. White would be alive if he played there.]
;B[pe]BL[84.921]C[Luckily he didn't notice, so I plugged it up asap!]
;W[oc]WL[30]OW[3]C[White is gunning for the kill.]
;B[kf]BL[64.984]C[But I don't need to win the race, I can just capture a different group. =)]
