;B[pd]C[Normal opening move that maximizes Black's fuseki options.]
;W[dd]C[A balanced response that also gives White options and permits Black to choose a cross-fuseki.]
;B[qp]C[If you've seen any of my own games, this is a favorite opening of mine since it intends on probing the lower left corner if White plays on the star point.]
;W[op]C[This direct approach is quite aggressive in that it omits the lower left corner and immediately shows Lee Sedol's intentions on not giving Gu Li a simple game.]
;B[eq]C[This response was surprising to me. Based on my understanding of this move, the 5-3 move here shows an intention at negating any influence White might build from the P4 approach and possibly building the left side later on.]
;W[qq]C[White's attachment here makes sense since Black chose to take the other corner. White seems to be aiming to settle the lower right before moving onto other parts of the board.]
;B[cp]LB[jd:A][dj:B][pj:C][jp:D]C[Though this might be difficult for many kyu players to do, Black ignoring White's attachment is a great example of kiai (i.e., fighting spirit). In addition, if White insists on trying to secure the lower right corner (which is difficult to do since the R4 aji is near impossible to silence this early in the game), then Black will get sente to play a bigger move on the board and White will be overconcentrated.

Question: Since White does not want to put all his efforts in the lower right, where is the biggest point on the board right now?]
;W[cj]LB[jd:A][pj:C][jp:D]C[The left area (B) is correct. The left side is currently the biggest since Black's shimari's strong side is facing it, thus giving Black the most potential to build territory there if given a chance to play in the left first. In addition, White has an opportunity to potentially grow the left side due to his star stone.

The top area (A) is the second best answer since both players would have star points which could benefit and grow the top area if possible.

The right area (C) is not big for White since the lower right corner is still far from finished. As a result, it's hard to imagine that White will make much profit on the right at the moment.

The bottom area (D) is what I would consider the least profitable area for White. The reason for this is because Black already has a shimari that is negating any real building power that White could possibly gain from the lower right. And since both players have stable groups on the bottom, not much profit can really be seen from it.]
;B[rq]C[Black now returns to the lower right corner.]
;W[pq]C[White naturally must draw back to prevent the atari.]
;B[qm]LB[ro:A]C[A number of kyu players are probably familiar with the tiger's mouth at A instead of this two-space extension, but based on my understanding, it seems that this is faster at establishing a base and is a more flexible and lighter shape.]
;W[qf]LB[kq:A][rr:B]C[This move really surprised me. After all, based on my joseki knowledge, I would have thought that White would want to make a base with a move like A. However, upon second evaluation, perhaps the reason Lee Sedol tenuki'd is because there is a miai for a base at B as well. And if we've learned anything from their games against one another, it's that it's critical never to give your opponent the initiative if you can have any say in it.

Regardless, it seems like this move violates the approaching from a wider side principle, but perhaps Lee Sedol's purpose was to see what Black's intentions on the right were.]
;B[qh]C[Black's one space low pincer is a nice aggressive response that denies White a base on the right hand side, which works well with his R7 joseki choice earlier; thus keeping his stones as efficient as possible. (Though It does seem like his stones are a bit flat though since they are on the third line)]
;W[qc]LB[pc:A][qd:B]C[White chooses the calm 3-3 invasion.

Question: Which side should Black block?]
;B[qd]C[Correct. Remember to always block the direction where you have the most potential for profit. The top area has no supporting Black stones, so this is the best direction to block.]
;W[pc]LB[oc:B][rd:A]C[This is the standard joseki response. The hane at A (which some kyu players might feel compelled to do) will lead to an inferior result. 

Question: Should Black hane at B?]
(;B[od]C[Absolutely not. The extension is the correct move in this joseki. See variation for why the hane is wrong.]
;W[rd]C[White threatens to connect.]
;B[re]C[Black naturally blocks.]
;W[rc]C[Solid connection here is best.]
;B[qe]C[Black prevents the cut.]
;W[nc]LB[mc:B][me:A]C[And White skips out with a one space jump to prevent Black from sealing him in. 

At this point, Black normally continues the joseki by playing at A, which would threaten to seal White in at B. And normally if Black plays A, White will extend to B to gain profit while preventing Black from sealing him in. However, based on these two players, unless some group is in perilous danger, we know that they are always trying to undermine the other's plans and intentions.]
;B[lq]C[To Gu Li, White owed him a move down here, so he's taking advantage of the fact that the White group is now remarkably weaker and now Black has some potential for some territory on the bottom.]
;W[rr]C[Didn't I call it earlier? The S2 move here was the other miai for making a base and ensuring that Lee Sedol was not left with a weak group.]
;B[rp]C[Black cannot afford to give White easy life, so the connection is natural since is also helps out the right side.]
;W[mp]C[This shoulder hit seems to intend on getting out into the center. However, I would have to say that the shoulder hit seems like it would favor Black a little bit since it would help him build the center. Perhaps Lee Sedol has another plan in mind though.]
;B[jp]LB[nr:A]C[Black's knight's move to the 4th line here is nice since it builds the raises the structure of his bottom framework. In addition, Black can aim at the weakness at A and weaken White's group as a follow-up.]
;W[mq]C[White severs that possibility and stabilizes his group. Now while this might seem slow to some of you, remember that professional are always very sensistive to the strength of their groups and despise it when they have weak groups being chased around the board.]
;B[cl]C[Though it seems like a small extension, this move really starts to give the lower right some shape. As you can see, Black has a mini double-winged extension that actually looks quite impressive.]
;W[ej]C[White's jump here seems to signify an intention to build the left side.]
;B[el]C[This jump seems very natural since the lower right is starting to look a lot more like territory while White's upper left is incredibly thin.]
;W[dq]C[To be honest, I was half expecting a move on the top to threaten a bigger moyo, but that would probably have been an overly greedy idea when you consider how thin everything is in that area. 

With that said, this probe seems very well timed since White must be careful how he wants to reduce/invade Black's lower left.]
;B[dp]TR[cl][el]C[Black's block here is consistent with his two marked stones and challenges White to live in the corner.]
;W[fc]C[Surprisingly, White then tenuki's to start building the upper left.]
;B[cf]C[Black's approach here is more of an invasion. Now here's a simple question: What's the first move that should come to mind when Black plays here?]
;W[ce]C[Correct! Since you have the C10 stone already pincering the C14 stone, the kick is perfect!]
;B[df]C[Black naturally stands up.]
;W[ch]C[And with this move, White takes away Black's base while establishing one for himself. A very nice multi-purpose move.]
;B[gf]TR[cf][df]C[This two point jump is nice and light. If White insists on capturing the marked stones, Black can easily give them up since White would be overconcentrated on the left side and then would gain sente to build the right side.]
;W[gd]C[I have to say that this move would never have occurred to me. Though it seems slow though, it does radiate a magnificent amount of pressure on the Black group as a whole while starting to build the top.

Question: Where do you think Black's next move was?]
;B[eh]LB[if:B][gh:A]C[I would have never come up with this move myself. If it were me, I might have played A for shape or B if I was caught up in running. However, B leaves Black with little shape and A seems a bit lacking. The reason is that after seeing Gu Li's move, you can see that Black's group suddenly takes on some shape while playing directly on White's shape point. And with this move, Black is also pushing pressure back onto White in a sort of counter attack.]
;W[gj]C[Since White is now weak, White must jump out to prevent Black from sealing him in and making him live small.]
;B[gh]C[Man... This move is just beautiful. Not only does it continue to put pressure on White, but Black's group is starting to take some really nice shape as well.]
;W[ij]C[White continues to run into the center.]
;B[gl]C[To all my readers, here is a great example of attacking while gaining profit. Notice how Black is chasing White into the center while building the lower left for free? Man.... the plays...]
;W[er]C[At this point, Lee Sedol's group is out in the center and not in any severe danger. In addition, the lower left is simply WAY too big and out of control now. So naturally White must try and do something about it now.]
;B[dr]C[Black's cut here is natural and secures the corner.]
;W[fq]C[The atari is correct in this case since White is simply trying to gain some strength and plant aji around the bottom.]
;B[ep]C[Solid connection prevents a second atari at E4 that would be used if Black simply captured at C3.]
;W[hp]TR[jp][lq]C[When invading, it's extremely important to play lightly. In this case, not only does White do just that, but now he calls into question Black's marked stones and what he wants to do with them. After all, they don't have a base!]
;B[jn]C[Not surprisingly, Black chooses to simply jump into the center. This helps his weak group while continuing to put White's group behidn enemy lines.]
;W[hm]LB[jq:A]TR[jn][jp][lq]C[This move was surprising to me. I was expecting an attachment around A or something to settle, but this move really starts to complicate things since it starts to help the H4 group a bit while keeping the marked Black stones more of less cut off from his allies.]
;B[hn]C[Though you typically don't attach to weak stones, Black seems intent on cutting off White's stoneswhile trying to connect his weak group back to the left side.]
;W[gn]C[The hane here is the only option since White needs to either make shape or start something complicated.]
;B[ho]C[Black's extension here is nice since it doesn't give White any easy ataris and keeps the White stones weak while he gains some strength and shape.]
;W[ds]C[White uses a forcing move here since it seems like he may be trying to live on the bottom.]
;B[cr]LB[cq:A]C[Though Black could capture at A, that would give White the atari at C2, so this extension is best for removing complications.]
;W[go]C[White returns to keep Black cut off while starting to connect his stones together.]
;B[gm]C[Black makes good on his threat and cuts off White and forces him to try and make life.]
;W[ip]LB[in:A]TR[hn][ho]C[Here is an excellent forcing move since it threatens to capture the marked stones with A.]
;B[jo]C[The bamboo joint is the most effective shape for this scenario.]
;W[jq]C[White hane's to try and gain a base.]
;B[kq]C[Black naturally tries to prevent White from linking up with his N3 group.]
;W[jr]C[This descent here helps to ensure life by either connecting up with N3 or making life with a move like H2.]
;B[fj]C[Black has gained a bit of strength now, so he decides it's time to wedge in and cut White apart.]
;W[fi]TR[cf][df][gf][eh][gh]C[This is the correct direction to atari from is it maximizes White's possibility of counter-attacking the marked Black group. Remember, always try to find ways to turn your opponent's strength back at them!]
;B[fk]LB[ei:A][gi:B]C[Black obviously cannot let White capture his stone.

Question: Which side should White connect on?]
;W[ei]TR[gj][ij]C[Correct. The left side is bigger. The marked White stones can be used for aji later on.]
;B[gi]C[Black completes his wedge attack by severing the connection.]
;W[fh]C[White now pushes through to make life and take advantage of Black's thin connections if Black tries to resist.]
;B[fg]C[Black blocks with the intenion of forcing White to live small while sealing him in.]
;W[eg]C[White naturally ataris.]
;B[ef]C[And with this extension, Black gets great shape while White just seems quite cramped.]
;W[bf]C[White's hane here was unexpected. I think the goal was to expand his corner while giving his group a miai for life.]
;B[bg]C[Black blocks.]
;W[be]C[White connects.]
;B[cg]C[Black prevents the cut.]
;W[bh]LB[ag:A]C[White threatens to connect at A.]
;B[ie]C[I guess at this point, Black must have read out that White has a miai for life. As a result, he didn't want to spend any more moves making White actually alive since that would reduce his ko threats if a ko should arise later on.

This move also seems dual purpose in that it impacts and reduces the topo while starting to grow and expand his center potential.]
;W[gr]C[This move completely bewildered me. My guess though, is that Lee Sedol had plants for a big invasion/fight in the center, so he needed to ensure that this group was absolutely stable before he embarked to the next fight.]
;B[lj]TR[gj][ij]C[This move is very nice. Not only does it seem to swallow up the marked White stones, but it also seems to have the effect of growing both the G12 wall along with the right side.]
;W[ll]C[And with this White embarks to do something about Black's center.]
;B[nk]TR[gj][ij]C[Black is not worried about White saving the two stones since it would probably be in gote. In addition, this direction clearly shows to build the right hand side in a very efficient way (aka very few stones have been placed on the right hand side compared to the G12 wall, yet it looks quite big).]
;W[jl]TR[hn][jn][ho][jo][jp][kq][lq]C[White goes ahead and connects. This calls into question whether the marked Black group will get cut off and possibly die or not.]
;B[im]TR[gj][ij][jl][ll]C[Black ataris here. And though it seems like a forcing move since it doesn't seem to work (to my eyes at least). I think that there may be some hidden reading that I'm not seeing that would have bigger implications since the marked White stones have a rather thin connection.]
;W[ki]C[White continues to reduce Black's center potential while strengthening his group.]
;B[kj]C[Black has no intention of letting White connect easily.]
;W[li]C[White tries to gain some strength.]
;B[mj]C[Black keeps solidly connected.]
;W[jj]C[White extends for shape while trying to keep his group connected.]
;B[jh]LB[ji:A]C[I feel like this is violation of the principle of "peeping when one can cut", but I believe that Black had intentions to harrass the group as a whole while building territory instead of starting a complicated fight.]
;W[ji]C[White has no choice but to connect in bad shape.]
;B[mm]C[Black now surrounds the entire White group.]
;W[mi]C[White takes this opporunity to extend and gain some strength.]
;B[ni]C[Black must not let White take his shape point.]
;W[nh]LB[mh:A]C[White hane's to try and make shape. Though the cut at A seems a bit scary, I think that a nasty fight would have resulted if Black had cut at A.]
;B[oh]C[Black double hane here is calmer and clearly takes clean profit on the right side while keeping the White group weak.]
;W[ng]LB[mh:A]TR[qf]C[White extends to gain shape. Thisp rotects the cut at A while also threatening to utilize the aji of the marked stone.]
;B[og]C[Black continues to take solid profit.]
;W[hi]TR[ie][cf][df][ef][gf][bg][cg][fg][gh][gi]C[And now White makes some eye shape while reminding Black that the marked group is not quite alive yet.]
;B[hh]C[Black prevents the easy atari while making eye shape for his group.]
;W[ih]C[White wedges and does not plan on giving up easily!]
;B[ig]LB[ii:A]C[Black must block.

Question: Should White connect at A?]
;W[hg]LB[gg:A]C[Absolutely not! One must not be afraid of ko for they are vital to getting stronger. However, the question now is: Should Black connect at A?]
;B[ii]LB[gg:A]C[Nope. While there is technically nothing wrong with connecting at A, there is a general principle one should remember: If given the opportunity, take the first ko since it's free and you'll reduce one threat for your opponent.]
;W[oi]C[Nice threat here. White threatens to break into Black's right side and wreak havoc.]
;B[nj]C[The right side is very big of course, so Black must connect.]
;W[ih]C[White recaptures the ko!]
;B[gg]C[Now Black can connect. There is a big difference now because the right side is much more solid than before. And Black got that for free since he took the ko first. =)]
;W[jg]C[Now this is where the true ko lies, the double atari.]
;B[ii]C[Black of course recaptures.]
;W[of]TR[od][pd][qd][qe][re]SQ[og][oh]C[Though this might seem harmless, based on my reading, White threatens to make a miai of capturing either of the marked stones.]
;B[pf]LB[pg:A]C[Black obviously must stop this. Do realize that there is a double atari left at A though.]
;W[ih]C[White takes back the ko.]
;B[ed]C[Black threatens to breka into White's upper left corner.]
;W[ec]C[White must protect, unless he wants to have his territory destroyed and be cut up into two weak groups.]
;B[ii]C[Black takes the ko.]
;W[pg]LB[pf:B][og:A]C[Remember that double atari? Haha. The question is: Should Black save A or B?]
;B[ph]C[Correct. This is bigger since it protect sthe right side which Black has painstakingly worked on.]
;W[ih]C[Lee Sedol takes back the ko.]
;B[de]LB[cd:A]C[Black now threatens to cut at A and ruin White's corner.]
;W[cd]C[Though this might seem like bad shape, this minimizes Black's threats in the upper left hand corner (since if he played the double tiger mouth for good shape, Black can play ko threats like D17 or C16.]
;B[ii]C[Black recaptures the ko.]
;W[ml]C[White threatens to break into the right side while also gaining more liberties and possibly have a chance at connecting back to the P4 group. However, this does seem a bit non-threatening though.]
;B[hj]C[Gu Li seemed to think so at least, and he ends the ko.]
;W[nl]C[Making good on his threat, Lee Sedol pushes through and we'll get to see what Lee Sedol had in mind when he played this ko threat.]
;B[ol]C[Black naturally blocks to protect his right side.]
;W[om]LB[nm:A]C[This hane leaves me feeling a little uneasy since I see a cut at A, however, I guarantee you that Lee Sedol had some counter attack in mind if Black tries to cut at A.]
;B[pl]C[Black chooses to play calmly and just take profit on the right. ]
;W[me]C[Though I might have though White would connect at A, this move is nice since it starts to link back up to the top and ensure the safety of White's group and prepares for something later on.]
;B[ag]TR[eg][bh][ch][fh][ei][fi][cj][ej]C[Black's descent here cuts off the marked White group and now forces them to make life.]
;W[dh]C[White captures the stone.]
;B[bk]C[Black reduces White's eye space whiel expanding his lower left territory.]
;W[dg]C[White makes his second eye and is now alive (though in gote).]
;B[lo]LB[kp:A]C[Black makes shape and protects the cutting point at A.]
;W[hk]C[White uses a forcing move that threatens to start a ko again.]
;B[gk]C[Black makes a clean capture a ko is probably to his disadvantage.]
;W[pe]LB[me:A][nf:B][rf:C]TR[od][pd][qd][qe][re]C[Remember White's move at A? In addition to giving White a way to move to the top, it now also protects the cut at B! How nice! And this capture threatens to cut off the marked stones with the descent at C.]
;B[rf]C[Black cannot let that happen obviously. After all, that would be at least a free 10+ points. =)]
;W[mc]LB[oc:A]C[This extension here is solid since is makes territory while removing the threat of Black trying to push and cut at A.]
;B[jc]LB[ie:A]C[Black now utilizes his A move from earlier to jump into the top and destroy and territory potential White might have had there.]
;W[hc]TR[id][jd]C[Again, this move seems incredibly slow to me and would not have occurred to me in my own game, but I can see the merits of it as it radiates strength and stability while gaining territory and threatening to cut through the small knight's move.]
;B[kr]TR[gn][go][hp][ip][fq][jq][er][gr][jr][ds]C[Black's descent here is a bit questionable to me, since it doesn't seem to openly reduce any of White's points, but perhaps the aim here is to constrict White and possibly challenge White's life and death skills for his marked group.]
;W[kh]LB[ih:A]SQ[lg][mg][lh][mh]C[White clearly does not see it as a threat and tries to make some territory in the center area.

Question: Should Black connect at A?]
;B[jf]C[By now you probably aren't surprised, but the answer is no! The ko that White is threatening to start is not critical so there's no reason to back down from a ko fight!]
;W[ih]C[White starts another ko fight.]
;B[oc]LB[ob:A]C[Black pushes through and threatens to separate the groups by descending at A.]
;W[ob]C[White naturally blocks.]
;B[jh]C[Black takes back the ko.]
;W[kn]LB[kp:A]C[White threatens to cut at A if Black ignores.]
;B[ln]LB[km:A]C[Black protects the cut while maintaing shape and also preparing to gain a couple of points later on with an atari at A if given the opportunity.]
;W[ih]C[White takes back the ko.]
;B[fp]LB[gp:A]SQ[cm][dm][em][cn][dn][en][co][do][eo]C[Black threatens to cut at A and makes a huge profit in the D6 area.]
;W[gp]C[White naturally connects.]
;B[nm]LB[jh:A]SQ[qn][rn][qo][ro]C[I was surprised that Black did not take the ko back at A. I guess Black is aiming to expand his R6 area by the capture at P6?]
;W[if]C[White finishes the ko.]
;B[sr]TR[mp][op][mq][pq][qq][rr]C[Black now calls into question the life of the White group.]
;W[nr]LB[qr:A][qs:B]C[Most kyu players would probably have played a move like A or B, but here we can see the pro's reading ability and recognition of key shape points. with this hane, White is very much alive and Black cannot call it into question later on.]
;B[hf]C[Black plays the double atari.]
;W[ig]C[White connects]
;B[kg]LB[jh:A]C[Black naturally follows it up with another atari. Once more, should White connect at A?]
;W[hi]C[Nope! Why not take a free ko?]
;B[pb]C[Question: How should you respond to this ko threat?]
(;W[nb]C[Correct. This is the most solid response since it minimizes the number of threats the Black would have in this area.]
;B[ii]C[Black takes the ko.]
;W[jh]LB[he:A]TR[jc][ie][jf][kg]C[White does not have any threates nearly as large as a 10 point capture, so he connects and threatens to cut off the marked stones at A.]
;B[he]C[So Black connects solidly.]
;W[je]SQ[lf][mf][lg][mg]C[White now exploits Black's cutting points to make more territory in the M13 area.]
;B[cs]C[Black descends to protect his corner. ]
;W[js]LB[es:A]C[I'm sure many kyu players would instinctively connect at A, but let's face it, Lee Sedol's reading is way better than ours and it seems that the L2 move from earlier probably had some hidden tesuji behind it, which is why Lee Sedo simply descends at K1 instead of connecting at A.]
;B[es]LB[fs:A]C[Black captures.

Question: Should White try to start a ko with A?]
(;W[fr]C[Though I've spend most of this game telling you not to back away from ko fights, this is an instance where it is bad for you to get into one since White has a lot to lose. (To see for yourself, go back to Move 171 and click on F1.)]
;B[ic]LB[id:A][jd:B]C[This extension here limits White's territory from expanding further while connecting back with the J15 group. If you think that White can wedge at A though, Black will play the double atari at B and then it's a miai for capturing either the J16 or K15 stone.]
;W[on]C[White saves his P7 stone while limiting the growth of the R6 area.]
;B[no]LB[oo:A]C[Black threatens to push and cut at A.]
;W[mo]LB[nn:A]C[White first threatens to counter cut at A while destroying a point from Black (since it could have formed an eye).]
;B[nn]C[Black connects solidly.]
;W[oo]C[White then connects solidly as well.]
;B[ik]LB[hk:A]C[Black captures the A stone.]
;W[jk]LB[hk:A]C[White connects to try and force Black to capture the A stone in gote.]
;B[qr]C[Here is a great example of the professional's tenacity to constantly keep the whole board in mind. Since capturing the A stone would be in gote and only worth 2-3 points, Black sees that this cut and capture is much bigger and takes it.]
;W[lp]TR[kq][lq][kr]C[Here we once again see how Lee Sedol and Gu Li really hate following their opponents. Lee Sedol says, "Okay. You want that stone? Let me threaten to cut you off and capture your three marked stones in return."]
;B[kp]C[Black cannot let White get such clean profit at this stage of the game.]
;W[qn]C[White now embarks to reduce the R6 area.]
;B[pm]TR[qn]C[Black connects and threatens to cut off the marked stone.]
;W[np]LB[lm:A]C[White's connection here seems like he's simply trying to protect his eye shape, but there's a hidden agenda. Can you see it?]
(;B[ko]C[Since I saw it, it's no surprise that Gu Li saw it. Haha. If you're wondering what it is I was talking about, go back to Move 186 and click S1 to see the variation.]
;W[ls]C[My endgame is pretty terrible, but from what I can see, White is expanding his bottom territory while preventing Black from reducing it any further. Although if you ask me, it seems like A (R5) would be bigger since it would threaten to continue destroying the right side. (On second thought though, perhaps this move has to deal with the a life and death situation)]
;B[pn]C[Black now makes good on his threat and cuts.]
;W[en]C[Since White cannot save the stone, it's better to take this time to tenuki and take something bigger.]
;B[hr]C[This attachment was surprising to me. I think this is meant to plant aji for later on.]
;W[hs]C[Again, my reading is not even 0.1% of what Lee Sedol and Gu Li can read, but I'm assuming this is the strongest response to Black's attachment at H2.]
;B[bj]C[Black expands his territory.]
;W[dm]LB[ck:B][ek:C][dl:A]C[White trying to encroach on Black's territory while threatening a push at A and exposing the cutting points of B and C.]
;B[dn]LB[em:A]C[Black's attachment here is strong and threatens to cut at A.]
;W[em]C[White must connect since his goal is to reduce Black's territory.]
;B[dk]C[Black protects the push and cuts while threatening to take away White's second eye.]
;W[dj]C[White must connect to live.]
;B[bi]C[Obvious sente move that threatens to destroy White's second eye.]
;W[ci]C[White must respond, but at least he is now completely alive.]
;B[eo]LB[fn:A]C[Black expands his territory while threatening to cut White off with the wedge at A (F6).]
;W[fn]C[White connects solidly.]
;B[cm]C[Black seals off his left territory.]
;W[pr]C[White returns to the lower right to seal off his territory while protecting his eyespace in sente.]
;B[rs]C[Black makes a clean capture.]
;W[il]LB[hl:A]TR[im][mm][nm][hn][jn][ln][nn][ho][jo][ko][lo][no][jp][kp][kq][lq][kr]C[This capture might seem small, but it's sente because if White gets to play at A (H8) next, the entire marked Black group will die.]
;B[hl]LB[ik:A]C[So Black naturally captures.

Question: Is it worth preventing the ko at A (J9)?]
;W[oe]C[The ko is no important and is only worth about half a point to my knowledge. There are much bigger plays elsewhere.]
;B[ke]TR[jf]C[Black tries to maximize the aji of his cutting stones to reduce White's territory, but apparently this is one of three mistakes that costs Gu Li a couple of points. I can't see it personally, but it's just something to keep in mind and look for when you see more advanced reviews of the game.]
;W[kf]C[White captures.]
;B[jd]LB[id:A][jf:B]C[Black protects his connection at A (J16) while threatening to start a ko at B (K14).]
;W[ib]C[Again, my endgame is rather weak, but this move does seem bigger than the impending ko fight.]
;B[jb]C[Black prevents White from expanding his territory any more.]
;W[hb]C[White connects solidly.]
;B[jf]C[Black starts the ko as expected.]
;W[lf]C[White chooses not to fight the ko and simply extends.]
;B[sd]LB[sc:A]C[This hane here looks harmless. 

Question: Should White block at A (T17)?]
(;W[qb]C[Absolutely not. If you can't see why, go back to Move 217 and click on T17.]
;B[nd]LB[md:A]C[Black threatens to push and cut at A (N16).]
;W[md]C[White connects solidly.]
;B[lb]C[Black makes a couple points while reducing White's territory.]
;W[ah]C[This descent looks harmless to me, but I guess is destroys a point or two of Black's territory.]
;B[ck]C[Black connects solidly here to reduce his cutting points in order to increase his territory a point or two. And though a stronger player probably knew this earlier, Black is ahead at this point.]
;W[fe]LB[ff:A]TR[ed][de][cf][df][ef][ag][bg][cg]C[Nice sente move and threatens to cut off the marked group by cutting at A (F14).]
;B[ff]C[Black must connect.]
;W[io]LB[jm:B][lm:C][in:A][mn:D]C[This move destroys a point for Black at A (J6), but it also seems to have a hidden agenda as well. (I'm thinking of the aji of the cutting points around B, C and D)]
;B[qg]C[Black seals off his right side while threatening to capture two stones.]
;W[pf]C[White connects since he can't afford to give away any more points.]
;B[ee]C[Though Gu Li saves a stone and prevents Lee Sedol from gaining two points, this is the second mistake that Gu Li makes since it is in gote and gives White sente to try and catch up.]
;W[je]C[White now takes this opportunity to take the ko again. This makes sense considering the fact that he is behind and must take risks to possibly stage a comeback.]
;B[dc]C[This cut seems harmless, but it prevents all sort of nasty aji. For a possible variation, click L16 to see what I am reading out.]
(;W[cc]C[White responds in the strongest way possible while minimizing Black's ko threats.]
;B[db]LB[jf:A]C[I'm a little surprised that Black extends here. I expected him to recapture the ko at A, so it seems like he wasted a ko threat.]
;W[cb]C[White responds again to prevent any craziness from occurring.]
;B[kd]C[Black decides not to fight the ko anymore. Black is ahead, so he does not want to complicate matters further. Don't forget, when I say Black is ahead, I mean only by a few points tops.]
;W[hd]LB[id:A]TR[jb][lb][ic][jc][jd][kd][ke]C[White threatens to cut off the marked Black group by A (J16).]
;B[id]C[Black obviously must connect.]
;W[lm]TR[mm][nm][nn][no]C[White puts the marked group in atari.]
;B[mn]C[Again, Black's lead is only slight (i.e., a few points), so Black obviously cannot hand over eight points to White and connects.]
;W[jm]LB[in:A]TR[mm][nm][jn][ln][mn][nn][jo][ko][lo][no][jp][kp][kq][lq][kr]C[White now threatens to cut at A (J6) to kill the marked group.]
;B[in]C[Black connects.]
;W[lc]C[This move seems to destroy Black's territory, and based on what I see, doesn't necessarily expand on White's territory.]
;B[ja]C[Black creates a point of territory for himself (at L19) and threatens a sente endgame push at J19.]
;W[ia]C[White increases his terrotry on the top by one point while preventing the push.]
;B[fd]TR[fe]C[Black threatens to capture the marked White stone. This is the third and final mistake that Gu Li apparently makes since it is not truly sente and once again gives White a chance to take sente to play elsewhere.]
;W[km]C[This move completely surprised me. After all, the F15 stone seems bigger since it would be a two point gain for Black while savighte L6 stone only seems like a point and a half at most? But if I try to think at a higher level, saving the F15 would be in gote and I think there are greater implications with this stone than we see now.]
;B[af]C[Black reduces White's territory with a push.]
;W[fm]C[White destroys the eye possibility at F8.]
;B[ek]C[Black connects solidly to prevent any multiple cut aji from appearing.]
;W[ae]C[White protects his upper left corner.]
;B[ps]C[Black reduces White's territory by one point.]
;W[os]C[White naturally blocks.]
;B[qs]C[Black does not wish to fight the ko, so he connects. And by all accounts, Black is still slightly ahead at this point.]
;W[po]TR[qn]C[White threatens to save his marked stone.]
;B[qo]C[Black naturally cuts him off.]
;W[ge]C[White finally comes back to save the F15 stone.]
;B[kc]C[Black increases his territory by one point (L17).]
;W[ne]TR[oe][pe][of][pf][qf][pg]C[White prevents the sente push at O15 (since it would be an atari on the marked group) and increases hiw territory by one point (O14).]
;B[lr]C[Black reducing White's territory again.]
;W[mr]C[White connecting and preventing Black from coming in any further.]
;B[ma]C[Black threatens to gain another point at M19.]
;W[mb]C[White prevents that from happening.]
(;B[rg]C[Black connects here to prevent the endgame throw-in tesuji. To see what I'm talking about, go back to Move 262 and click on O18.]
;W[na]TR[ma]C[White expands his territory by one point (P19) and threatens to capture the N19 stone.]
;B[la]C[Black connects.]
;W[sc]TR[sd]C[White seals off his corner and threatens to capture the T16 stone.]
;B[se]C[Black connects. At this point, the game is seemingly over and Black has about a 2.5 point lead.]
;W[ai]C[White still trying to stage a comeback by reducing Black's territory on the left.]
;B[aj]C[Black blocks.]
;W[ks]TR[im][mm][nm][hn][in][jn][ln][mn][nn][ho][jo][ko][lo][no][jp][kp][kq][lq][kr][lr]C[White connects here in sente. This not only puts the marked group in atari, but also prevents Black from descending at L1 later on since it would further reduce White's territory (taking away the N1 point).]
;B[hm]C[It should come to no surprise that Gu Li connects.]
;W[kk]C[White creates another point at L8.]
;B[fs]C[Black destroys the G1 point.]
;W[jf]C[White ends the ko at K14. And at this point, it seems that White has closed the gap and the game to turn any direction.]
(;B[ok]C[Black connects to prevent the cutting aji of P9 later on. If you don't know what I mean, go back to Move 274 and click on N9.]
;W[gs]TR[es][fs]C[White prevents the reduction push at G1 later on and threatens to capture the marked stones.]
;B[ds]C[Black dutifully connects.]
;W[pp]LB[hi:A][ik:B]C[This seems to be a dame (i.e., neutral) point to me. It seems like A or B would be better since they are worth at least half a point.]
;B[le]LB[hi:A][ik:B]C[Again, this is a dame point as far as I can tell, and I don't see why it's bigger than the ko battle at A (H11) or B (K9).]
;W[ik]C[White connects to end the J9 ko.]
;B[hi]C[Black also connects to end the second ko.]
;W[mk]C[Another dame point.]
;B[lk]C[Dame.]
;W[fo]C[Dame.]
;B[fl]C[Dame.]
;W[dl]C[Dame.]
;B[ld]TW[aa][ba][ca][da][ea][fa][ga][ha][oa][pa][qa][ra][sa][ab][bb][db][eb][fb][gb][pb][rb][sb][ac][bc][dc][gc][ad][bd][mf][nf][kg][lg][mg][eh][lh][mh][di][kl][gq][hq][iq][nq][oq][hr][ir][or][is][ms][ns]TB[ka][kb][sf][sg][rh][sh][oi][pi][qi][ri][si][gj][oj][pj][qj][rj][sj][ak][pk][qk][rk][sk][al][bl][ql][rl][sl][am][bm][rm][sm][an][bn][cn][qn][rn][sn][ao][bo][co][do][ro][so][ap][bp][sp][aq][bq][cq][dq][sq][ar][br][rr][as][bs][ss]C[Final dame point. And as a final result (even though KGS Score Estimator thinks that Black is ahead by 1.5 points), Lee Sedol was able to make a surprising comeback and win the game by 1.5 points. What an incredible game!])
(;B[mk]C[Assuming Black is just filling in dame points...]
;W[lk]LB[ok:A]TR[ni][kj][lj][mj][nj][mk][nk]C[And White fills this in as well, you should be able to see now that the aji of the P11 stone exposes a cutting point at A which would capture the entire marked group.]))
(;B[na]C[If we assume that Black pushes here.]
;W[se]C[The throw-in tesuji looks something like this. White throws in a stone.]
;B[sf]C[Black presumably captures.]
;W[sc]C[White descends.]
;B[se]C[And if Black tries to save his stone,]
;W[rg]C[Then White will capture the whole Black group. Obviously no professional would fall for this, but this is just to illustrate the throw-in tesuji I was referring to in Move 263.]))
(;W[kd]C[If White ignores the ko threat to gain a couple of more points here.]
;B[cc]C[Black will descend.]
;W[bc]C[White will hane.]
;B[bb]C[Black will now hane too.]
;W[ab]C[White would probably try to double hane here.]
;B[db]C[Black would probably try something like this.]
;W[ba]C[White cannot live, so the atari seems natural.]
;B[ca]C[But then Black will start another ko which could impact the livelihood of the H18 group. Bad juju all around...]))
(;W[sc]C[Most players might just block on instinct.]
;B[qb]C[But what would you do if Black extends like this?]
;W[rb]C[If you try to play here...]
;B[ra]C[Black will atari.]
;W[se]C[You'll obviously capture.]
;B[sb]C[And then Black will start a ko that is completely in his favor. After all, The corners was yours to begin with, if Black manages to win, he steals a corner away from White. Otherwise, he'll profit somewhere else. Win win for Black and disastrous for White.]))
(;B[rs]C[If Black did not see O4's hidden agenda and captures the S2 stone for example...]
;W[lm]TR[mm][nm][nn][no]SQ[ln][lo]C[BAM! Black's marked stones are captured since if they connect at A it is a shortage of liberty situation and then the M5 stones would get captured as well!]))
(;W[fs]C[If you try and start a ko fight now.]
;B[fr]LB[fq:A][fs:B]C[Black will simply capture. And though it's a "ko fight," Black has White in double atari at A and B and can possibly put the whole life's group into question (or at least reduce it into only a measly two to three points).]))
(;W[na]LB[oa:B][nb:A]C[Though this is not "wrong," you give Black ko threats at A or B later on.])
(;W[pa]LB[nb:A]C[Seems like a solid move, but you open yourself up to ko threats like A later on.])
(;W[qb]LB[nb:A]C[Similar to Q19, this seems good; but you open yourself up to another ko threat at A.]))
(;B[oc]C[Though the hane is commonly found in the standard 3-3 invasion, when White has a stone at R14 (aka the small knight approach), this is 100% WRONG.]
;W[rc]LB[od:A][rd:B]C[This move punishes Black's mistake. If Black blocks at B, White will cut at A and shenanigans will happen that heavily favors White (as long as no egregious mistakes occur). If Black connects at A, then White connects up with the R14 stone with S16 and Black's intention on building the right side by blocking at R16 is in complete shambles.]))
