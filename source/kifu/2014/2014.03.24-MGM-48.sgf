;B[pd]BL[2690.446]C[I really should try some other first moves as Black, but alas, the flexibility of the star point is too attractive for me to give up right now. Haha.]
;W[dd]WL[2688.438]C[White maintains calm balance.]
;B[qp]BL[2684.302]C[The start of my current favorite fuseki.]
;W[op]WL[2685.67]C[White has experienced what I can do with it if given the opportunity to approach the lower left corner, so his intention was to probably complicate the game and prevent me from gaining a strong opening.]
;B[eq]BL[2672.619]C[After reviewing Lee Sedol's and Gu Li's second game from their jubango, I was inspired by Gu Li to play this move.]
;W[cp]WL[2653.612]C[White immediately approaches the corner here.]
;B[do]BL[2669.622]C[I decide to go ahead and press White down while intending to take sente to return back to the lower right corner.]
;W[co]WL[2629.91]C[White extends which is normal joseki.]
;B[dn]BL[2668.308]LB[dp:A]C[Black extends once as well (and you'll notice that the ladder resulting push and cut at A (D4) does not work in White's favor.]
;W[cm]WL[2629.188]LB[dm:A]C[According to the normal joseki, Black should push once more at A (D7). At the time, however, I was not aware of this and was more interested in returning back to the lower right corner.]
;B[lp]BL[2664.361]C[And since I built up thickness on the left, the pincer was the only appropriate move.]
;W[pm]WL[2617.153]C[Don't quote me on this, but I'm pretty sure this is the most popular joseki in this position.]
;B[pp]BL[2659.931]C[This move was inspired by my friend Yuki who had just used the trick play on me earlier that day. ]
;W[oo]WL[2595.441]C[The proper refutation starts here (which keeps White's stones linked).]
;B[oq]BL[2657.449]C[Black hanes.]
;W[nq]WL[2578.725]C[White hanes.]
;B[np]BL[2599.469]C[And then Black cuts here for the trick play. ]
(;W[mq]WL[2389.987]C[The proper refutation is here (which White plays wonderfully).

To see how I got tricked, go back to Move 17 and click O2.]
;B[no]BL[2446.246]C[I'm at a total loss as to what to do, so I decide to extend here.]
;W[pq]WL[2323.389]C[To be honest, I competely forget about this atari. ]
;B[or]BL[2441.555]C[I extend to the second line to at least leave some aji on the bottom.]
;W[pr]WL[2322.049]TR[oq][or]C[White must block in order to keep the marked stones captured.]
;B[on]BL[2373.213]C[And then I decide to go ahead and sacrifice the entire corner in exchange for power with the following sequence.]
;W[po]WL[2313.891]C[White runs.]
;B[pn]BL[2364.16]C[Atari.]
;W[qo]WL[2306.128]C[extend.]
;B[qn]BL[2342.745]C[Atari again.]
;W[ro]WL[2303.469]C[White extends again.]
;B[rn]BL[2338.33]TR[pp][qp][oq][or]C[And extend once more to maximize the aji of the marked stones.]
;W[rp]WL[2285.084]C[So White must turn here to finish the sequence. 

As you can see, I gave up a pretty big corner, but I managed to seal White in and gain some power for the right hand side. Probably still better for White, but it was the best I could do with the situation at hand.]
;B[jd]BL[2316.038]C[Since I chose to gain power with my P6 wall, I thought that this move was the best since it sketched out a nice broad moyo. (I debated the corner approach at R17, but thought that White would definitely pincer.)]
;W[qg]WL[2274.457]LB[rd:A][qj:B]C[White seems the potential issue.

Question: How should Black respond? A (S16) - Protect the corner? B (B10) - pincer?]
;B[qi]BL[2292.078]TR[pm]C[Though you normally want to push your opponent into your thickness, I felt that the pincer made more sense in this case since White already had the Q7 stone (which does negate a bit of the power of the P6 wall).]
;W[rd]WL[2233.239]C[White slides and threatens to establish a base in the corner.

Question: How would you respond?]
;B[qc]BL[2195.146]C[I decided that letting White settle would be too easy. So I took away the corner and wanted to keep White weak.]
;W[rc]WL[2165.571]C[White extends to try and establish a base.]
;B[rb]BL[2069.566]C[I hane once more to prevent White from gaining an easy base. One thing I want to note though is that I was not focused on gaining corner territory yet. The goal was to simply keep White weak and harrass it.]
;W[rh]WL[2162.29]LB[ri:A]C[When White plays here, he expands his base, but I also think that he was fully expecting me to block at A (S11).]
;B[rf]BL[2036.399]C[For one reason or another, I decided that responding at A (S11) would be too passive and decided to hit the vital point of the shape instead.]
;W[qe]WL[2093.283]C[White of course cuts Black off, but I never had any intentions of saving the S14 stone. The goal was to simply take away White's eye shape and keep it at one eye tops so that I could keep harrassing the group.]
;B[ri]BL[2028.873]LB[rg:A]C[Now I descend to block since it would give my S14 stone a chance to escape with A (S13) if I wanted.]
;W[si]WL[2043.915]LB[sj:A]C[I was not expecting this hane. I believe White's purpose was to cut off the S14 stone in sente since Black would normally block at A (T10).]
;B[qf]BL[1972.6]C[But after some reading, I realized that this push worked.]
;W[pf]WL[2031.291]C[White tries to block, but I have this read out.]
;B[pe]BL[1954.404]LB[re:A][pg:B]C[Black now has A (S15) and B (Q13) as a miai.]
(;W[re]WL[2005.619]C[White tries to remove the other miai. If you're wondering how the other miai works, go back to Move 45 and click on Q13 instead.]
;B[pg]BL[1947.181]C[So Black makes the atari here.]
;W[sf]WL[1961.126]C[White tries to salvage the situation.]
;B[of]BL[1942.982]C[Black makes a clean capture to remove the Q14 aji.]
;W[rg]WL[1957.807]LB[pf:A]C[When White plays here, should you connect at A (Q14)?]
;B[sh]BL[1926.534]C[The answer is no. This throw-in falsifies White's eyes and keeps White at zero eyes.]
;W[pf]WL[1952.902]C[White can try to capture.]
;B[qf]BL[1924.971]C[But Black can immediately capture it right back and leave White dead.]
;W[ph]WL[1944.934]C[White tries to create aji by separating Black's groups.]
;B[qh]BL[1910.4]C[Black seals White in and prevents him from escaping.]
;W[sj]WL[1942.533]C[White tries to run.]
;B[rk]BL[1880.176]C[But Black had no intention of letting him escape.]
;W[pi]WL[1920.615]TR[qh][qi][ri]C[White tries to counter attack and possibly capture the marked Black stones.]
;B[pk]BL[1870.967]TR[qh][qi][ri]C[This move here is a nice shape for kyu players to remember. It protects the marked stones while also counter-attacking against the Q12 stones.]
;W[pj]WL[1903.958]LB[rj:A]TR[qh][qi][ri]C[White threatens to capture the marked stones by playing at A (S10).]
;B[qk]BL[1867.212]C[Now Black connects with the bamboo joint.]
;W[mi]WL[1898.852]TR[rc][rd][qe][re][sf][qg][rg][rh][si][sj]C[White now trries to run, but the marked White group is dead and Black has quite a big of territory now.]
;B[ki]BL[1857.46]C[Since White is trying to escape, and I have a ton of power around the board, I felt capping the group was very severe and would force White to flail around while I tries to secure other territory.]
;W[nn]WL[1893.701]C[White tries to exploit the cutting aji here now to hopefully gain access to the center.]
;B[nk]BL[1785.762]TR[no][np]C[I decided that being able to kill the marked stones was bigger than saving the O5 stones.]
;W[lj]WL[1864.123]C[White tries to escape...]
;B[ln]BL[1746.904]TR[ph][mi][pi][lj][pj]C[So I decide it's now appropriate to clear up the cutting aji and continue putting pressure on the marked stones.]
;W[ml]WL[1834.654]TR[qh][qi][ri][nk][pk][qk][rk][on][pn][qn][rn]C[White now tries to cut off Black's marked stones since they're not quite alive yet.]
;B[nm]BL[1727.429]C[But Black has this ladder in his favor. ]
(;W[jk]WL[1721.878]C[White continues to run.

If you can't see the ladder, go back to Move 69 and click on N6.]
;B[jm]BL[1608.499]C[So I keep on cahsing while possibly building the bottom.]
;W[kh]WL[1636.855]C[White attaches in hopes of settling by capturing the marked stone, but I thought the group was far from settled.]
;B[fc]BL[1469.069]C[So I decided to take a big point and build the top.]
;W[go]WL[1616.164]C[White dives right into my bottom moyo.

Question: What's the most severe attack Black can make on White?]
;B[gm]BL[1455.967]C[Correct. The cap here forces White to try and make life in Black's influence.]
;W[fm]WL[1606.883]C[White attaches to try and make shape.]
;B[fn]BL[1438.421]C[Since I'm strong in the area, I hane'd here to keep White separated.]
;W[gn]WL[1568.51]C[White cuts.]
;B[hm]BL[1434.422]C[In a crosscut, it's almost always good to extend. This helps to seal White in and continue attacking the G5 group.]
;W[gq]WL[1519.104]LB[iq:A]TR[dn][fn][do][eq]C[White jumps down to the third line. Black would love to pincer the group at A (J3), the marked stones are now weak and could die if Black continues to try to kill the G3 group.]
;B[cn]BL[1377.131]C[I decided to go ahead and take advantage of the weak point in White's shape.]
;W[bn]WL[1509.123]C[White must block.]
;B[dm]BL[1374.436]C[Now Black can push to get out.]
;W[cl]WL[1504.112]C[White must extend to protect his group.]
;B[fp]BL[1356.858]C[I played here to poke at White's shape, but I'm not sure it's actually a good move.]
;W[gp]WL[1443.164]LB[jq:A]C[I'm lucky that White decided to connect, but I actually thought that White would just establish a base at A (K3).]
;B[fl]BL[1329.952]C[Similar to before though. I felt I was too weak to really counter attack and try to kil White, so I chose to atari here to keep my groups connected.]
;W[fo]WL[1318.967]C[White tries to exploire the aji of the F7 stone with the atari.]
;B[dp]BL[1267.497]C[This descent might seem slow, but I thought that I would be able to establish a base if I really needed to with C3.]
;W[en]WL[1296.887]C[White captured my stone.]
;B[iq]BL[1243.67]C[But now I felt I had White sufficiently suffounded that I could kill him.]
;W[dl]WL[1280.025]
;B[em]BL[1239.941]C[At first it seems like I'm aiming for a ko.]
;W[el]WL[1277.88]C[White knows he can't live, so he must obviously cut Black off from the center.]
;B[eo]BL[1232.801]C[But I had a different plan in mind with the double atari.]
;W[fn]WL[1266.209]C[White must connect to have a fighting chance.]
;B[cq]BL[1230.753]C[And then I got ahead and establish a base with C3.]
;W[gl]WL[1254.7]C[White now starts to cut apart my groups.]
;B[fk]BL[1228.37]C[I must extend.]
;W[gk]WL[1249.726]C[White chases.]
;B[fj]BL[1224.246]C[I extend.]
;W[er]WL[1244.54]TR[fj][fk][fl]C[White realizes he can't capture the marked stones in time, so he tries to attack my D4 group on the bottom left.]
;B[dr]BL[1208.997]C[But I have it read out and I don't see how I will lose the capturing race.]
;W[fq]WL[1225.257]C[White tries to start a ko.]
;B[fr]BL[1196.937]C[But once I cut..]
;W[ep]WL[1217.901]C[And even though White tries to atari and force the ko.]
;B[dq]BL[1195.057]C[Black can simply connect and is now alive.]
;W[gr]WL[1205.334]C[White still trying to make something happen.]
;B[es]BL[1187.533]C[Clean capture keeps Black alive.]
;W[jp]WL[1185.807]C[White is now hoping to possibly connect to the N3 stones. I debated playing K3, but I felt I would end up in a losing battle. To see the variation, click on K3.]
(;B[lq]BL[1165.151]C[So I decided to sever the connection immediately, however, this would prove to create way more complications than I thought.]
;W[jq]WL[1172.339]C[So White cuts off the J3 stone.]
;B[kr]BL[1161.019]C[I hane to prevent White from gaining any forcing moves while threatening to connect to J3.]
;W[jr]WL[1166.209]C[White has to cut off the J3 stone to have any chance of coming out alive.]
;B[io]BL[1151.982]C[So I start to poke at the group's eye shape.]
;W[jo]WL[1151.323]C[White threatens to cut off my J5 stone.]
;B[in]BL[1143.532]LB[ip:A]C[So I pull back and thinking that White will play at A (J4).]
;W[gj]WL[1138.912]C[White tries to increase his liberties here and keep pressure on the F10 group.]
;B[fi]BL[1134.492]C[So I had to extend in order to increase my liberties and keep White cut off.]
;W[km]WL[1137.817]C[This attachment threw me in for a whirlwind since I was not anticipating getting cut off.]
;B[kn]BL[1045.396]C[I had no choice but to start a capturing race.]
;W[jn]WL[1134.905]C[White cuts as intended.]
;B[ip]BL[1027.408]C[I connect in order to maximize my liberties.]
;W[ir]WL[1129.468]LB[jl:A]C[I think this move was a mistake on White's part since A (K8) seemed like a good forcing move to reduce Black's liberties.]
;B[kl]BL[1021.329]C[So I went ahead and took the atari for myself first.]
;W[lm]WL[1103.7]C[White must extend.]
;B[jl]BL[1003.828]LB[mk:A]C[Then I connect solidly to maximize my liberties and threaten to cut off the marked stones with A (N9).]
;W[mm]WL[1031.864]LB[mk:A]C[White tries to repair the aji at A (N9) by threatening to connect to O6.]
;B[mn]BL[997.338]LB[mk:A]C[But the aji at A (N9) still exists.]
;W[mk]WL[978.486]C[And White has no choice but to connect.]
;B[ik]BL[959.173]LB[ij:A]TR[gj][gk][gl]C[At this point, I'm aiming at either escaping for capturing the marked White groups, so I hane here.

For those curious about what I would have done if White hane'd at A (J10), click on J10 to see the variation.]
(;W[jj]WL[956.468]C[White extends because the hane variation at J10 (see Move 131 for the variation) was doomed for failure.]
;B[ij]BL[955.934]C[I had this variation read out too however, so I extended as well.]
;W[ii]WL[934.754]C[White tries to block as I predicted.]
;B[ji]BL[941.732]LB[ih:B][kj:A]C[So with this cut I can now capture the marked stones with A (L10) or atari at B (J12).]
;W[gi]WL[925.579]TR[fi][fj][fk][fl]C[White's extension here puts a lot of pressure on the marked stones since a hane at F12 would be very difficult to deal with. Don't forget that while White's stones on the bottom might be captured at the moment, any group that dies in this fight will reverse the game in White's favor.]
;B[fh]BL[822.866]C[So I extend again to ensure that White cannot capture my F11 stones and based on my reading, I still have a miai. You'll see shortly what I mean.]
;W[kk]WL[807.356]C[White takes away the capture here.]
;B[ih]BL[804.539]C[But this atari still works because of my extension at F12.]
;W[hi]WL[763.331]C[White connects.]
;B[jh]BL[799.862]C[But once I connect here, White cannot break out. He is short one liberty when he tries to break out (which you'll see shortly).]
;W[gg]WL[688.834]C[White tries to jump out.]
;B[gh]BL[796.459]C[Black can cut.]
;W[hh]WL[680.145]C[White tries to push out.]
;B[hg]BL[793.035]C[But Black can cut.]
;W[ig]WL[679.317]C[White tries the double cut.]
;B[hf]BL[791.287]C[But when Blakc extends.]
;W[jg]WL[678.672]TR[ih][jh][ji][ki]C[White's extension here is not a threat since the marked group has two liberties.]
;B[kg]BL[788.47]C[So Black atari's here.]
;W[li]WL[674.393]C[White tries to exploit a shortage of liberties ]
;B[lh]BL[784.899]C[Black captures.]
;W[kj]WL[673.387]C[And while White can try to atari.]
;B[kh]BL[781.651]C[Black is completely safe.]
;W[ie]WL[664.9]C[White tries to complicate matters.]
;B[if]BL[727.026]C[But after some reading, I realized the ladder works in my favor. If you can't see it, click on K14.]
(;W[hl]WL[615.377]C[White tries for one last aji cut for a possible seki.]
;B[il]BL[721.238]C[But Black connects and ends the capturing race.]
;W[ll]WL[615.133]TR[hh][gi][hi][ii][gj][gk][gl][hl]C[White tries to salvage his marked group now, but since Black is not concerned about the marked group (since any more would be self-atari)...]
;B[nj]BL[708.955]C[Black can extend here to threaten to falsify White's eye and also remove the possibility of White living.]
;W[ni]WL[598.875]C[White plays here to try and salvage the situation, but after I sit in thought for some time, he must have seen that he could not live and thus resigned.
