;W[dq]WL[1195.987]
;B[pd]BL[1195.172]
;W[dc]WL[1193.918]LB[pj:A]C[This is my favorite counter opening as White against the possible sanrensei of Black at A.]
;B[do]BL[1194.137]C[When Black approached here, I had no idea what I wanted to do. ]
;W[nq]WL[1174.246]C[So instead of committing to a move, I decided to ignore him instead.]
;B[de]BL[1191.95]C[This was a rather interesting double approach and really throws the whole game into a state of fuseki chaos since it's not quite clear what's going on.]
;W[dj]WL[1148.809]C[Based on my understanding of the common josekis that occur in the corner, I thought this would be the best point to ensure that my opponent did not get an ideal position when the joseki was over. Notice that I chose the 4th line because the idea is I want to keep it light and available for fighting later.]
;B[cq]BL[1187.754]C[Normal attachment.]
;W[cr]WL[1145.908]
;B[cp]BL[1186.712]
;W[er]WL[1144.6]C[This seems a little flat for White, but the importance with this tiger's mouth is that it's solid and is not easily attacked.]
;B[cl]BL[1185.689]C[Black settles with his base.]
;W[fp]WL[1139.081]C[And the joseki ends here with White giving his shape some height.]
;B[cc]BL[1183.51]C[Same joseki as before.]
;W[cb]WL[1086.362]
;B[cd]BL[1180.543]
;W[eb]WL[1082.361]
;B[ch]BL[1177.247]
;W[fd]WL[1081.633]C[I chose to play the normal joseki because all Black really got was two safe groups. There is no real synergy between the groups and with the White stone at D10, I was setup for possible reduction fighting later on. ]
;B[el]BL[1170.694]TR[dj]C[This move seems to threaten the D10 stone, but it is a light stone that cannot be easily captured. So I didn't want to run out and strengthen Black for no reason.]
;W[nc]WL[1076.401]C[So I chose another approach move.]
;B[hq]BL[1168.558]C[Black decides to pincer here, but here is where the stability we took the time to gain with E2 shines since it's not like White will easily die.]
;W[jq]WL[1069.365]C[WIth the semi-thickness I had on the left, I made a counter-pincer.]
;B[fq]BL[1165.136]C[This attachment seemed like it was aiming at poking out White's shape. In all honesty, it seems to have more of an intent to kill than one should have at this point. White is not really in danger.]
;W[ep]WL[1032.659]C[Remember, getting sealed in is very bad early in the game (because it gives you no options for later on). So with that concept in mind. I chose to give myself a way out into the center.]
;B[gp]BL[1163.304]C[Black chooses the shape point.]
;W[fn]WL[1013.9]C[I jump out to avoid getting sealed in.]
;B[go]BL[1161.482]C[Black takes away my shape point.]
;W[jd]WL[993.323]LB[fo:A]C[Here is a bit cavalier of me. I thought I read out a sequence where if Black tries to push and cut with A, I would be able to secure a nice corner in exchange. However, my reading is a bit off; but luckily my opponent doesn't try to push and cut. See Move 31 variation for what I'm talking about.]
(;B[hd]BL[1154.481]C[Funny thing is that I recently invaded here against my friend Nate, so I thought I would test his response to how my opponent would respond.]
;W[ge]WL[983.883]C[Solid diagonal that attacks the Black stone and puts an immense amount of pressure on it.]
;B[lc]BL[1151.095]C[This second invasion showed me that this was not going to be an easy game.]
;W[ld]WL[966.728]C[I decide to keep it simple and see what Black wanted to do. Although some might feel squeemish at the idea of giving up the top, that is simply the nature of go: give and take.]
;B[kc]BL[1148.569]
;W[kd]WL[962.729]
;B[jc]BL[1147.495]
;W[ic]WL[961.336]C[I decide to hane here aggressively since I have more reinforcements than he does.]
;B[id]BL[1146.063]
;W[ib]WL[958.148]C[I imagine my opponent thought I would extend at A, but that's nonsense, Nate showed that to me last game we played. Haha.]
;B[md]BL[1144.106]
;W[mc]WL[950.23]C[I cut again because there is no way I will lose the capturing race.]
;B[le]BL[1142.414]
;W[kf]WL[942.786]C[Jumping out to prevent from being sealed in.]
;B[me]BL[1135.208]
;W[jf]WL[927.411]LB[if:A]C[This shape seems a little too clumpy. I think A would have been more efficient. In addition, this bamboo joint is prone to a shortage of liberties weakness which we will see later.]
;B[if]BL[1132.311]
;W[ig]WL[911.708]C[Hane to put pressure.]
;B[hf]BL[1130.08]
;W[fg]WL[904.277]C[Knights move to continue the attack.]
;B[jg]BL[1128.918]C[This cut was ill-timed and lacked reading. Black assumed that because he had the star point it would serve as the ladder breaker, but that was not the case this time. ]
;W[jh]WL[881.214]C[If you disagree with my reading, see the variation for Move 53. ]
(;B[gg]BL[1105.148]
;W[fh]WL[860.168]
;B[gh]BL[1101.536]C[Black is clearly very aggressive in his fighitng.]
;W[gi]WL[856.528]C[I hane because I believe I have the advantage.]
;B[hi]BL[1080.952]
;W[hh]WL[840.022]C[I was ready for this cut when I hane'd.]
;B[fi]BL[1068.78]

;B[ff]BL[1067.631]
;W[gf]WL[822.034]C[Ready for this too!]

;W[ih]WL[815.798]
;B[eg]BL[1055.944]
;W[eh]WL[802.495]LB[ei:A]C[At this point, I forgot about reading the potential ladder variation at A, but fortunately it works out in my favor.]
;B[fj]BL[1047.709]
;W[ei]WL[789.444]LB[ef:A][fk:B]C[I decided to secure the connection here at E11 since the cut at E14 and F9 would be miai.]
;B[np]BL[1037.504]C[When Black attached here, I didn't want to play out the joseki where I gave him a corner.]
;W[qq]WL[761.443]C[So I dove in instead.]
;B[kg]BL[1032.432]C[Black extends here, but I read that nothing has changed with the ladder.]
;W[lg]WL[731.841]
;B[je]BL[1027.569]C[Oh wait.... crap. See? The weakness of the bamboo joint. Stupid shortage of liberties....]
;W[kh]WL[699.061]
;B[ke]BL[1026.076]C[Oh well, at least I get sente.]
;W[op]WL[689.93]C[This was actually really bad. I thought I would benefit from this exchange, but Black gets a realy nice corner.]

;W[hj]WL[615.786]
;B[bi]BL[998.254]TR[cc][cd][de][ff][eg][ch][bi]C[AT the time. I couldn't understand the point of this move, but it's because Black is conncered about his marked group.]
;W[fm]WL[581.434]C[I thought it was small, so I moved onto securing the center.]
;B[aj]BL[995.992]

;W[bo]WL[452.735]
;B[ci]BL[963.021]
;W[co]WL[451.731]C[Now I get a pretty big corner, though it is in gote, which is a bit sad.]
;B[gm]BL[958.151]C[Black secures his connection.]
;W[pn]WL[426.107]C[I turn my last hope to trying to secure more territory in the center.]
;B[qn]BL[956.085]
;W[qm]WL[424.628]
;B[ro]BL[954.683]C[Black plays this out of habit as if he was on the first line, but this is not that great because...]
;W[rn]WL[422.279]
;B[qo]BL[952.854]C[Now his shape is kind of wacky.]
;W[pg]WL[406.993]C[So I move on to trying to expand my center framework as much as possible.]

;W[rl]WL[402.645]
;B[sn]BL[947.464]

;B[ol]BL[945.351]LB[pm:A]C[Black threatens to cut at A.]
;W[nm]WL[390.659]C[Instead of protecting directly, this moves out the group and indirectly protects against the cut.]
;B[nl]BL[941.768]
;W[mm]WL[384.658]
;B[ng]BL[938.8]C[This move seems like a good way to threaten to break into White's center.]
