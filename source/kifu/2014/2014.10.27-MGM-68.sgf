;W[fq]C[With White's low knight's approach to start the game, all I can think is: time to be proactive.]
;B[hq]C[And nothing says proactive like the one space low pincer!]
;W[cn]C[Of course. I should have expected the double approach.]
;B[fp]C[I decide to follow joseki and see where it goes. Since White double approaches, it shows that White is willing to switch directions. As a result, Black will then take the other side.]
;W[cq]C[White dives into the 3-3 as expected.]
;B[eq]LB[fp:A]C[And keeping consistent with the attachment at A (F4), Black blocks to take this bottom side.]
;W[cp]C[And then White settles her group. At least I get sente now right? Haha.]
;B[pj]C[So I take a large point and form a sanrensei.]
;W[nq]C[White approaches again with the knight's move.]
;B[pn]LB[kq:A][lq:B]TR[dp][fp][eq][hq]SQ[nq]C[As I'm reviewing the game now, I'm surprised I played here. I played here because I was afraid of another double approach, but this move is way too passive. I should have pincered at A (L3) or B (M3) since it would act as an extension to the H3 group (triangle) while attacking White's O3 stone (square).]
;W[qq]LB[qp:A][pq:B]C[White now invades at the 3-3. Where should Black block: A (R4) or B (Q3)?]
(;B[qp]C[Following the proverb, "Block on the wider side," it would seem like this is the correct answer; but in reality, it is not. Go back to Move 11 and click on Q3 to see why.]
;W[pq]C[White connects her group easily and settles with little concern. This is looking great for White.]
;B[op]LB[oq:A]C[I take away the shape point by extending here while threatening to push through at A (P3).]
;W[rq]C[White then descends to stabilize her group while leaving endgame potential for later since it undercuts the right side.]
;B[jd]LB[rp:A]C[I decide not to descend at A (S4) and aim to make a grand moyo.]
;W[qf]C[When White approaches here, I think, "Aha! Finally! A group to attack!"]
;B[qe]C[Kick! There is no other response!]
;W[pf]C[White stands up.]
;B[nd]C[And then I jump to keep pressure on White while building territory on the top.]
;W[rj]C[And then White does this funny three space knight move slide... I have no idea how to respond.]
;B[qh]C[So I try to aim at the cutting point to cut her apart. Just to note though, this was not verified by any reading. It was just a gut feeling. ]
;W[qi]LB[rh:A]C[To my surprise, White does not attach at A (S12) and instead plays the diagonal.]
;B[ph]C[I stand up to try and keep my stones strong.]
;W[pi]C[White pushes to keep my stones separated.]
;B[oh]C[I extend once more to play thickly and try not to expose easy cutting points.]
;W[oi]TR[pf][qf]C[White extends once more. And by this time, it is worth noting that the R14 stones (triangle) have been treated lightly and appear to be part of a sacrifice tactic at this point.]
;B[ni]C[I finally decide to hane since I believed I had enough strength to handle the cut.]
;W[nh]C[Sure enough. White cuts immediately.]
;B[rh]C[I descend down to prevent White from connecting easily by taking advantage of a shortage of liberty situation.]
;W[oj]C[White turns.]
;B[mi]C[So I extend with the intention of keeping White split into two weak groups and killing one of them.]
;W[qc]C[White's invasion here looks like an overplay; but in times of brutal fighting like this, one should view this more as a probe (i.e., find out what the other side is thinking).]
;B[qd]C[My connection here tells White that I intend on keeping White firmly separated even if it means I lose the corner in the process.]
;W[ng]TR[oh][ph][qh][rh]C[When White extends here, it becomes apparent to me that my S12 stones (triangle) are in imminent danger.]
;B[rf]C[So I connect them up with this hane.]
;W[lg]C[White now proceeds to run.]
;B[jg]C[So I play the most severe move I can to try and keep White boxed in.]
;W[kh]C[White plays the diagonal to threaten to push through.]
;B[jh]C[So I play solid and just extend.]
;W[kj]LB[ki:A]TR[mi][ni]C[White's attachment here made me almost want to push through at A (L11) instantly, but I realized that it would not work and would also cause my cutting stones (N11 - triangle)) to get captured (which would connect all of White's stones and be an epic failure for Black).]
;B[mk]C[So I jump to save my cutting stones.]
;W[ji]C[Which unfortunately gives White the initiative to push through my shape and create defects for her to exploit.]
;B[ii]C[I have no choice but to block.]
;W[ki]TR[mi][ni][mk]C[White connects solidly. And at this point, I'm starting to realize my initial idea may have been poorly planned since my O11 stones (triangle) were way too weak to begin with.]
;B[ok]TR[oi][pi][qi][oj][rj]C[I try my best to counter-attack the Q11 group (triangle).]
;W[pk]LB[nk:A]C[But White's cut here is a strong move since Black still has a weakness at A (O9) to take care of. ]
;B[nk]LB[qk:A]C[So while I would love to hane at A (R9) to falsify White's eye, I decide to secure my group instead since I'm not confident in the fight that would result if I were try to kill White.]
;W[pl]LB[nm:A]TR[mi][ni][mk][nk][ok]C[White's extension here, though seemingly slow, is a solid and appropiate move in this case since it further stabilizes he group whilte threatening to launch an attack on the N11 stones (triangle) by a splitting move like A (O7).]
;B[nn]LB[rl:A]C[So I try to connect up my stones while aiming at a possible sliding move at A (S8).]
;W[qm]C[The one thing professionals are always spot on about is evaluating the value of a group. And though moves like this seem "slow" to some, I've never seen a professional hesitate to play them in order to prevent the livelihood of their group from coming into question.]
;B[kk]LB[ih:1][ij:2][jk:3]TR[pf][qf][lg][ng][kh][nh][ji][ki][kj]C[So I now I turn my attention back to the L12 stones (triangle) and hope to try and make something happen here. However, while White looks sealed in, you should feel a bit unsettled having three cutting points for White to take advantage of.]
;W[le]C[White jumps to start making shape.]
;B[ld]C[So I attach with the mindset that I would be solidifying my top terrritory while keeping pressure on White.]
;W[je]C[White attaches again.]
;B[ke]C[Out of instinct I try to push through thinking that I could keep solidifying the top.]
;W[kf]C[White blocks.]
;B[kd]C[So I connect.]
;W[ih]LB[ij:A][jk:B]TR[je][kf]C[But with White's cut here now, the value of the K15 and L14 stones (triangle) becomes apparent and my weakness at A (J10) and B (K9) is ever more apparent.]
;B[ig]TR[jg][jh]C[I decide to try and minimize the damage by saving my K13 stones (triangle).]
;W[ij]C[White takes the double atari as expected.]
;B[hh]C[I capture to remove the aji from the stone.]
;W[jk]C[And with White's capture here, it should be apparent that Black's plan to kill White has ultimately failed.]
;B[hj]LB[dj:A]C[Even though White is alive, I know that the game is not over yet since I still have more territory (at the moment). So I go ahead and hane to make nice shape and hope to get an extension at A (D10) so that I have a large upper left moyo.]
;W[hk]C[White follows suit and maeks good shape as well.]
;B[jf]C[So I cut immediately in keeping with the idea of building a big top left moyo.]
;W[fc]C[White, of course, invades immediately to see how I handle the situation.]
;B[ec]C[Since I had so much thickness in the center, I could only think of one thing: kick!]
;W[fd]C[White stands as before.]
;B[df]C[And then I jump to try and start building the left side.]
;W[ic]LB[jc:A]C[When White takes a two-space extension here, impulsively I want to block at A (K17) to keep White cramped, but I didn't feel it was a strong enough move.]
;B[hd]C[So I jumped here to threaten to split the group apart.]
;W[hc]C[White extends to keep her stones connected.]
;B[jb]C[So I immediately jump down to prevent her from increasing the size of her base.]
;W[fg]LB[ff:A]C[She then nimbly jumps out two spaces and I'm left wondering if I can somehow cut it with an attachment at like A (F14).]
;B[dh]C[But I decide that it is too early to try and cut, so I simply keep calm and build the left side since this gives me territory while White is scrambling for life.]
;W[id]LB[je:A]TR[jf][ig][jg][hh][jh][ii][hj]C[White now threatens to connect with the K15 stone (A) and split separate my K14 group (triangle) from its allies and render it weak.]
;B[ie]C[Since having a weak and heavy group against a professional is essentially the equivalent of handing them victory, I had no choice but to capture.]
;W[he]C[White now cuts and starts making eyes.]
;B[ge]C[I spin around to try and falsify the eye.]
;W[hf]C[White extends.]
;B[gf]LB[ee:B][hg:A]C[So I extend with the intention of connecting up my stones with A (G13) or B (E15).]
;W[ee]LB[de:B][hg:A]C[But then White plays this peep which was unexpected. And while I could have just saved my stones with A (H13), I had feeling that the push at B (D15) would result in my corner/left side getting devatated and giving White a large chunk of territory.]
;B[de]C[So I chose to play it safe and connect solidly.]
;W[gg]C[White then blocked off my stones' escape route and made living shape. Oh well, at least I have sente!]
;B[ck]C[So I decide to play the large knight's move here to further solidify my territory since I'm under the impression I should be able to win at this rate.]
;W[ln]C[When White plays here, I must say that I thought it was pretty harmless.]
;B[kq]C[So I go ahead and take an extension on the bottom to increase my territory.]
;W[om]TR[mi][ni][kk][mk][nk][ok][nn][pn][op][pp][qp]C[When White peeps here though, I suddenly realize that my entire lower right group (triangle) is now under attack since they have no base and maybe have a single eye at best.]
;B[mn]C[So I try to connect up my stones while finding a way to make eye shape.]
;W[lm]TR[mi][ni][kk][mk][nk][ok]C[When White stands here, I realize that trying to save the O9 stones (triangle) might be fruitless and simply create additional burden for me.]
;B[lo]C[So I try to employ a sacrifice tactic to link all my stones together.]
;W[ko]C[White hanes.]
;B[lp]C[So I descend feeling pretty confident in the fact that I just connected my stones up together.]
;W[gq]C[But then White extends here and I have a sinking feeling that I may have overlooked something.]
;B[gp]C[I decide to save my stones and keep them connected, but I am unaware of how much danger I'm really in.]
;W[hr]C[When White hanes here, all I'm thinking about is finding a way to connect all my stones together. ]
;B[ip]C[So I try this tiger's mouth move that is actually really meek and pathetic.]
;W[iq]C[White instantly ataris.]
;B[hp]C[I connect since I've embarked to try and save all these stones.]
;W[er]C[But ]
;B[gr]LB[gr:B][ir:A]C[I really need to get a base for my stones, so I use this forcing atari to gain an eye. However, it's worth noting that it would have been one point better for me to simply cut at A (J2) instead while threatening the double atari of B (G2).]
;W[fr]C[White connects.]
;B[ir]C[And I cut with the double atari.]
;W[gs]C[So White captures and I'm left with sente.]
;B[il]TR[le][kf][pf][qf][lg][ng][kh][nh][ji][ki][ij][kj][hk][jk]C[I'm feeling pretty safe at this point, so I embark and attacking the L12 group (triangle) and hoping to finish out the game with my advantage still in tact.]
;W[jl]C[White descends.]
;B[ll]TR[mn][nn]SQ[lm][ln][ko]C[So I play this diagonal here to either connect back up with the N6 stones (triangle) or capturing the M7 stones (square).]
;W[kl]C[White decides to let me connect.]
;B[mm]C[So I take the opportunity to save my stones.]
;W[lk]C[White captures and puts another stone in atari.]
;B[ml]C[I then must connect to keep consistent with my plan to save my stones.]
;W[jn]LB[kn:A]C[White then protects the cutting point at A (L6) and is now very safe.]
;B[oq]C[I'm feeling pretty good about my lead at this point, so I embark on some reduction plays.]
;W[or]C[White blocks.]
;B[np]LB[nr:A][pr:B]C[I then push to threaten the double cut of A (O2) and B (Q2).]
;W[mq]TR[mi][ni][mk][nk][ok][ll][ml][mm][mn][nn][pn][lo][dp][fp][gp][hp][ip][lp][np][op][pp][qp][eq][hq][kq][oq][ir]C[When White extends here though, I suddently realize that my entire group (triangle) does not have a single eye....]
;B[jp]C[So I set out to try and make an eye.]
;W[jr]C[White plays the atari.]
;B[is]C[So I extend to try and keep my eye while keeping White separated.]
;W[kr]C[White then extends to try and connect up with her allies.]
;B[lr]C[I decide to block since I think that there may be some tesuji to help me live.]
;W[lq]C[White cuts as expected. At this time however, all I was thinking about was how to live.]
;B[ks]C[So I hane here in triumph as I've made life for my group. The only problem here is that I've completely missed a weakness. Can you see it?]
;W[kp]C[Yeah... Black's P3 group (triangle) is now cut off and practically dead.]
;B[jq]C[I got ahead and capture while trying to rack my brain with a way to save the group.]
;W[on]C[White reduces my eye shape.]
;B[mp]LB[nr:A]C[So I connect to make one eye while threatening the cut at A (O2).]
;W[mr]C[White obviously responds.]
;B[js]C[So I capture while still staring at the board for a tesuji to turn it around.]
;W[oo]C[White then descends to destroy and possibility of living shape.]
;B[nr]LB[ns:A]C[So I pounce thinking I can start a ko by throwing in here.

To see the ko I envisioned, click on A (O1).]
(;W[ms]C[But then White plays the easy move that I completely overlooked. After a few more seconds of staring at the board for any possibiliy of coming back, I realize I am one liberty short of anything working and resign here.])
(;W[ns]C[I envisioned White would capture.]
;B[ms]LB[nr:A][pr:B]C[Which would then allow me to throw in for a ko because if White connects at A (O2), then I could atari at B (Q2).]))
(;B[pq]LB[qp:B][pr:A]C[Correct. The reason for this is because it starts to split White into two groups and allows Black to gain more due to the threat of splitting White into two groups. 

There are two main paths for White to choose now: A (Q2) and B (R4). Click on either to see its continuation.]
(;W[pr]C[White will try to connect.]
;B[qp]C[Black will now turn to block the wider side.]
;W[rr]C[White has to defend the cutting point.]
;B[rq]C[And Black makes one final forcing atari.]
;W[qr]C[To which White is obligated to connect lest White wants to lose the corner as well and Black gets sente. Compare this to what was played in the actual game.])
(;W[qp]TR[pn]C[Some might be worried about this push, but this is where the Q6 stone (triangle) shines.]
;B[qo]C[Black can now block with a perfect tiger's mouth shape.]
;W[ro]C[White can continue to struggle.]
;B[rn]C[But Black continues to make beautiful shape and powerful thickness down the right side.]
;W[pr]C[White will then threaten to connect.]
;B[or]C[But Black will block.]
;W[qr]C[White will connect.]
;B[oq]C[Black repairs his cutting point.]
;W[sp]C[And then White must protect the cut unless White intends to die. So as you look at the position now, though White's successfully got the corner, White was completely sealed in and Black has radiating thickness for the remainder of the game and has prospects on both the right and bottom side now. Too good for Black.])))
