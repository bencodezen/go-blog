;B[pd]BL[2396.777]C[Black starts with the very normal star point.]
;W[dc]WL[2394.475]C[I wasn't afraid of a cross-fuseki and had no intention of giving Black an easy approach move to my upper left corner, so this 3-4 was a natural choice for me.]
;B[pq]BL[2394.453]C[Oh? Possible Chinese fuseki...]
;W[eq]WL[2376.509]C[Alright then. I'll choose the 5-3 point to reduce the potential of your bottom side (which is a key area for the Chinese fuseki to at maximum efficiency).]
;B[qk]BL[2343.32]C[So Black chooses to go with the low Chinese...]
;W[nc]WL[2356.107]C[Since the bottom is not as interesting due to my 5-3 already being in place, the top has the most potential for me since the strong side of my 3-4 is facing the top.]
;B[pf]BL[2325.278]C[This one point high jump is perhaps the most common response to White's approach and is the correct way to respond if you simply want to respond calmly and not pincer.]
;W[jd]WL[2347.714]C[I clearly have a bias towards moyos because I'm usually quite fond of this follow up move after the approach if Black does not pincer.]
;B[jp]BL[2301.54]LB[ci:A][di:B][po:D][cp:C]C[To my surprise though, Black chooses to take his double winged formation with this. And to be honest, I was rather stumped for a while on what to do. I sat for quite a while debating between A (C11), B (D11), C (C4), and D (Q5).]
;W[di]WL[2113.926]LB[po:D][cp:A]C[After more than four minutes later of thinking and agonizing, I decided to play here to setup a sort of high Chinese opening to counter Black's low Chinese opening. (Granted, it would be better if my 5-3 stone in the lower right was on a star point, but I had a plan for the likly scenario that Black would play at A to stop my corner enclosure.

People watching this game apparently thought this was rather gutsy since it's inviting a moyo vs moyo game (which most people will inform you is a bit harder on White than it is on Black). 

For those wondering why I didn't choose D (Q5), it's because I didn't like the idea of creating a target for Black to attack this early. As someone who studied the Chinese opening rather extensively, I didn't very much like giving Black an easy opportunity to solidify some points.]
;B[cp]BL[2091.676]C[Sure enough. Black hops right in.]
;W[cn]WL[2094.818]TR[di]C[I had the one space pincer prepared for this in order to try and build off the high stone I played at D11 (triangle) earlier.]
;B[ep]BL[2068.848]LB[fp:A][dq:B]C[Black chooses the attach variation to the one space pincer. The most common responses to Black's attachment here are A (F4) and B (D3), which would you choose and why?]
;W[dq]WL[2034.23]LB[en:C][fp:A][dq:B]TR[jp]C[I chose B (D3) because I didn't see much potential to get territory on the bottom due to Black's K4 stone (triangle). In addition, I wanted to settle my group as quickly as possible in hopes to get a move like C (E6) so my moyo can continue growing.]
;B[fq]BL[2011.615]C[To my utter shock and surprise, Black hanes! I have a feeling this was motivated by the notion of "hitting two stones on the head."]
;W[dp]WL[2001.025]C[However, letting White push through and cut here is really painful.]
;B[fp]BL[1952.039]C[Black connects since blocking would be an overplay.]
;W[ne]WL[1857.728]LB[do:A]C[At the time, I felt really compelled to play at A (D5), but thought it might be too small, so I tried to think on a bigger scale with this one point jump. HOWEVER, for those reading this, I was wrong on both counts. (Details omitted).]
;B[dn]BL[1903.251]C[Lucky for me, Black was unable to punish my tenuki properly. ]
;W[do]WL[1638.088]C[So I had a chance to fix it.]
;B[dm]BL[1877.245]C[Black extended to try and prevent me from building the left side.]
;W[fn]WL[1591.878]C[I decided to try and cut him off with this knight's move since it hit on the vital shape point. HOWEVER, this was not the proper way to cut Black apart. I had the right idea, but there was a simpler and more effective was of doing this. (Details omitted).]
;B[eo]BL[1829.246]LB[fl:B][en:A][co:C]C[Black plays this really ugly shape move to keep connect. I almost cut at A (E6) immediately, but felt that Black would counter-attack with B (F8) and then I would be left with a weak group in Black's area of influence (and not to mention there is a weakness at C (C5) right now).]
;W[co]WL[1514.435]C[I did not like the sound of that, so I treated my F6 stone (triangle) lightly for now and repaired this cutting point so I could tell that I would be in a lot of trouble if Black got this cut. ]
;B[cm]BL[1812.024]LB[fl:B][en:A]C[Black turns and I'm once again tempted to cut at A (E6) but am afraid of the counter-attack at B (F8).]
;W[fl]WL[1457.226]C[So I decide to jump first to keep my shape light and gain some more center potential while starting to indirectly reduce Black's moyo.]
;B[bm]BL[1698.828]C[To my surprise, Black ignores me a third time.]
;W[en]WL[1443.001]C[So I decided to finally cut Black off and try to attack Black as severely as I could.]
;B[ek]BL[1462.708]C[Black tries to break out.]
;W[fk]WL[1379.925]C[I decided to push once and make contact with this group once in order to strengthen my own group (since it was still vulnerable to a counter-attack if I wasn't careful).]
;B[ej]BL[1457.529]C[Black extends as I expected.]
;W[gi]WL[1377.587]C[And then I could play this knight's move to continue harrassing Black while increasing my influence in the center.]
;B[ei]BL[1424.844]C[Black pushes.]
;W[dh]WL[1370.769]C[I extend along the line of victory.]
;B[fh]BL[1372.718]C[Black plays the kosumi (i.e., diagonal) to try and get out.]
;W[gh]WL[1316.632]LB[gj:A]C[I maintain pressure on the group with this contact play since I still has the cutting point of A (G10) that I have to keep in mind.]
;B[ff]BL[1353.688]LB[df:A][gg:B]C[Black jumps here, but this is an overplay. White can punish and cut Black apart. (Details omitted).

At the time though, I couldn't see that I could cut Black, so my focus was on A (D14) and B (G13). Which would you choose to attack Black?]
(;W[df]WL[1303.723]LB[gg:B]C[I felt that the jump here was better because it helped me solidify territory on the left while helping to keep my stones connected. To see why B (G13) is wrong, go back to Move 37 and click on G13.]
;B[gg]BL[1331.024]C[Black takes the shape point.]
;W[eg]WL[1292.807]C[I decide to ruin's Black shape now while strengthening my own with this peep.]
;B[fg]BL[1235.294]C[Black connects.]
;W[ck]WL[1276.421]LB[el:A]C[And then I slide here to further solidify my left side while threatening a push and cut around A (E8). Though upon more detailed reading, it's not quite working for me yet.]
;B[el]BL[1218.759]C[Black certainly felt the threat though since he strengthened his connection in respond.]
;W[il]WL[1157.185]LB[gj:A]TR[gh][gi][fk][fl][en][fn]SQ[ff][fg][gg][fh][ei][ej][ek][el][bm][cm][dm][dn]C[I noticed my G12 group (triangle) was getting quite weak and that the cutting point of A (G10) was becoming more of an issue, so I chose to defend my group first before resuming my attack on Black's left group (square).]
;B[fd]BL[1139.855]C[Black is not yet alive and thus must keep his attention focused on finding eyes for his group.]
;W[ge]WL[1090.023]C[I peep at his shape.]
;B[gd]BL[1118.297]LB[fe:A]C[Black tries to threaten me to cut at A (F15), but I knew better than to do that. 

If you don't see the threat, click on A (F15), to see why it doesn't work.]
(;W[he]WL[1075.918]C[So I pulled back]
;B[fe]BL[1072.103]C[Black finally connects.]
;W[ig]WL[1037.939]LB[hc:A]C[This was an important moment for me in this game since it was focused on keeping my stones working together rather than on single notion of trying to "kill" Black's group with a move like A (H17) which was the first move I thought of at the time.]
;B[ic]BL[1012.385]C[Now that Black is more or less sealed off from the center, he has no choice but to try and find life on the top. And while this sort of ruins my plans of building the top, I thought that the influence I would get would give me the power I needed to gian some center territory in compensaion while also allowing me to invade and destroy Black's moyo as well. ]
;W[jc]WL[994.135]C[I descend to keep Black's eye space to a minimum.]
;B[ib]BL[991.213]LB[jb:A]C[Black descends to threaten the turn at A (K18) which would really help him with making shape.]
;W[jb]WL[968.331]C[So naturally I take away the shaep point and keep Black on the defensive.]
;B[ec]BL[953.634]C[Black continues trying to expand his eye space.]
;W[db]WL[953.119]C[I descend to start solidifying my territory and give me endgame moves for later if Black doesn't protect.]
;B[dd]BL[851.462]C[Black aims to make an eye with this hane.]
;W[cd]WL[949.739]C[I hane to keep all my stones connected.]
;B[de]BL[821.93]C[Black extends.]
;W[ce]WL[947.215]LB[bm:A]C[And then I extend once more to almost fully solidify my left side (but I am undercut by A (B7).]
;B[ef]BL[770.677]LB[gb:B][bk:A]C[Black forms an eye here, but this may not have been really necessary since Black should be able to find eyes within A or B area.]
;W[qe]WL[878.657]C[I decide to peep here now to see what Black's intentions were, but this was wrong strategically since my potential was in the center and not to mention Balck's lower right corner still needed to be dealt with.]
;B[pe]BL[763.139]C[Black connected solidly.]
;W[qc]WL[871.943]C[And then I went for the 3-3.]
;B[pc]BL[742.348]C[Black blocks.]
;W[qd]WL[834.007]C[I connected.]
;B[qf]BL[732.268]C[Black turned, and you start to see that White's gain in the corner is not nearly as good as Black's gain on the right side.]
;W[pb]WL[828.873]C[I hane to make shape and hope to get sente.]
;B[ob]BL[730.305]C[Black blocks.]
;W[qb]WL[827.619]C[I connect.]
;B[oc]BL[728.461]C[And to my delight Black connects and I have sente!]
;W[qi]WL[766.236]TR[ob][oc][pc][pd][pe][pf][qf]C[I decide to invade here because I'm thinking I can possibly attack the P18 group (triangle), but this is wishful thinking and a mistake. The lower right corner is far more important.]
;B[rf]BL[697.886]C[Black punishes my move properly with this sente descent. This threatens to attack my corner's eyespace.]
;W[re]WL[752.442]C[I block.]
;B[oi]BL[669.641]C[And then Black gets this great capping move. Ouch.]
;W[ng]WL[648.662]C[I decide to jump here because it felt like a mutual shape point that would severely impact my center potential if Black got here first.]
;B[pj]BL[636.739]TR[qi]C[Black really wants to kill the R11 stone (triangle). However, this is not a bad move though since it alaso impacts Black's lower right potential.]
;W[oh]WL[589.021]LB[po:A]TR[qi]C[This move starts a dubious sequences where I completely misread the outcome. In addition, it focuses solely on trying to save the R11 stone (triangle) instead of on a more strategic move like A (Q5).]
;B[ph]BL[581.771]C[Black blocks as expecetd.]
;W[ni]WL[566.497]C[I hane to try and continue making some territory in the center.]
;B[nj]BL[534.743]C[Black makes shape here, but I'm thinking it's a mistake.]
;W[pi]WL[561.866]C[Because I think this cut works.]
;B[oj]BL[531.07]C[Black connects.]
;W[pg]WL[560.027]TR[ob][oc][pc][pd][pe][pf][qf][rf]C[And then I gleefully atari thinking I have just successully cut off the P18 stones (triangle).]
;B[qh]BL[529.637]C[Black extends.]
;W[qg]WL[558.746]C[I atari.]
;B[rh]BL[527.473]C[Black extends.]
;W[rg]WL[556.973]C[I extend once more thinking, "Oh wait... Crap...."]
;B[sg]BL[520.659]C[Yup.. You saw it too right? Black has this atari that I completely forgot about.]
;W[og]WL[555.86]TR[oi][nj][oj][pj][qk]C[I connect out of frustration, but this was just compounding on my mistakes since I'm giving Black sente back. Epic fail by White because (1) Black's stones are all conected, (2) Black gets great thickness at P10 (triangle) to build the lower right, and (3) Black got sente. And the worst thing is that White has nothing to show for this trade. Oy vey...]
;B[po]BL[405.076]C[Black takes the key point and the game is pretty even at this point.]
;W[lm]WL[442.868]C[I decide to jump and reduce, but I should have considered invading instead.]
;B[lj]BL[229.533]C[Black decides to mutually destroy my center potential, but it probably would have ben better for him to simply defend the bottom.]
;W[lp]WL[360.15]LB[hp:A]C[I had been eyeing the weakness around A (H4) for quite some time, so I was happy to get this move since it would make the invasion that much stronger if I was able to get in there.]
;B[hn]BL[172.508]C[Black defends with this diagonal jump, but it seemed rather awkward to me at the time.]
;W[go]WL[319.22]C[It didn't take long for me to decide to cut the connection.]
;B[fr]BL[167.644]C[Black descends.]
;W[hq]WL[288.306]TR[eo][ep][fp][fq][fr]C[And then I decideto try and capture the F2 stones (triangle).]
;B[hp]BL[112.988]C[Black attaches to try and connect.]
;W[gp]WL[274.82]C[I cut.]
;B[gq]BL[110.17]C[Black cuts.]
;W[ip]WL[201.771]TR[eo][ep][fp][fq][gq][fr]C[And then here, I decide to abandon the idea of capturing the F2 group (triangle) since I believe that destroying Black's bottom right territory is much more important. You'll see why this atari signifies the switch in direction shortly.]
;B[ho]BL[98.241]C[Black connects.]
;W[jq]WL[184.439]TR[lp]C[Now I can make a tiger's mouth to connect to M4 (triangle).]
;B[hr]BL[74.531]C[Black ataris.]
;W[iq]WL[179.714]C[I connect.]
;B[gn]BL[60.465]TR[go][gp]C[And then Black has to capture the G4 stones (triangle) in order to connect all his stones.]
;W[er]WL[94.446]C[I realized my corner was in a bit of predicament, so I tried to defend it here. However, this was a mistake and Black could have really harrassed my corner if not killed it. (Details omitted).]
;B[aj]BL[7.815]C[Black monkey jumps into my left territory.]
;W[bj]WL[260.328]OW[14]LB[cf:A][cg:B]C[I thought about ignoring it, but felt the aji around A (C14) and B (C13) would be too much to handle and therefore responded by "hitting the monkey on the head."]
;B[al]BL[0.291]C[Black connects back to his group.]
;W[ai]WL[250.9]OW[13]TR[aj]C[I block while putting the A10 stone (triangle) in atari.]
;B[ak]BL[297.017]OB[14]C[Black saves his stone.]
;W[bh]WL[243.584]OW[12]LB[cf:A]C[And then I protect my cutting point using this tiger's mouth in order to give myself as much eye shape as possible in case Black decides to cut at A (C14) later on.]
;B[ap]BL[225.072]OB[13]C[Black now embarks on reducing my corner.]
;W[bp]WL[220.029]OW[11]C[I have to stop Black from connecting lest I want to die.]
;B[ao]BL[215.749]OB[12]C[Black pulls back to stay connected to his group.]
;W[bq]WL[178.411]OW[10]C[I extend to keep my eye.]
;B[aq]BL[209.781]OB[11]C[Black pushes once more, but I decide that this is not sente and choose to play somewhere else.]
;W[pm]WL[141.704]OW[9]C[This is an overplay, but at the time I was thinking I needed to reduce Black's right territory.]
;B[qm]BL[194.297]OB[10]C[Luckily for me, Black did not counter attack but instead chose to protect his territory.]
;W[pn]WL[57.033]OW[8]LB[qn:A]C[I was nearly out of time at this point, so I rush to play whatever normal moves comes to mind so that I don't lose on time. This threatens to push down at A (R6).]
;B[qn]BL[191.609]OB[9]C[Black blocks.]
;W[oo]WL[55.373]OW[7]LB[pp:A]C[I hane to threaten the atari at A (Q4).]
;B[op]BL[184.881]OB[8]C[Black hanes.]
;W[pl]WL[52.615]OW[6]C[So I extend here to take the shape point.]
;B[ql]BL[160.43]OB[7]C[Black connects solidly.]
;W[nb]WL[49.873]OW[5]C[And then I change directions to try and maximize my territory on top.]
;B[pa]BL[155.858]OB[6]C[Black hanes to reduce.]
;W[qa]WL[47.767]OW[4]C[I block.]
;B[oa]BL[154.58]OB[5]C[He connects.]
;W[no]WL[44.654]OW[3]C[And then I extend to keep my stones connected.]
;B[br]BL[106.718]OB[4]C[Black hanes here as I expected he would, but I knew that I was alive.]
;W[cr]WL[41.022]OW[2]LB[ds:A]C[With this block, I am fully alive. For those wondering what would happen if Black plays at A (D1), go to Move 200 to see the tsumego problem.]
;B[fm]BL[70.869]OB[3]TR[en][fn]C[Black captures the F6 stones.]
;W[gm]WL[34.461]OW[1]C[I atari once as a forcing move.]
;B[em]BL[63.831]OB[2]C[Black connects.]

;W[mp]WL[289.427]OW[14]C[I extend while trying to maintain the strongest shape possible.]
;B[ir]BL[300]OB[15]LB[or:A]C[Black extends here, but this is too flow. I expected a move like A (P2) instead.]
;W[qs]WL[279.615]OW[13]C[So I money jump to further dent his lower right territory.]
;B[qr]BL[276.084]OB[14]C[Black hits the "monkey on the head."]
;W[os]WL[275.663]OW[12]C[I jump back.]

;B[kq]BL[220.596]OB[12]C[To my surprise, Black ignored me again!]
;W[mj]WL[223.84]OW[10]C[So I happily ignored him and pushed through to cut the M10 stone (triangle) off and gain a much bigger chunk of center territory.]
;B[mk]BL[188.906]OB[11]LB[lk:A][nk:B]C[Black finally responds and blocks.

Question: Where would you cut: A (M9) or B (O9)?]
;W[nk]WL[214.908]OW[9]C[Since my goal is to gain the center, I start by cutting on this side.]
