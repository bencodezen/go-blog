;B[qd]BL[1797.068]C[Black starts with a 3-4 here, so I ruled out playing in the lower left corner since Black has already shown preference towards the right side.]
;W[dd]WL[1797.379]C[With the game this early however, I decided to play a move that allows me to develop the top since Black's weak side was exposed.]
;B[pq]BL[1789.277]C[Black chooses the alternative 3-4, so it's hard to predict where this will go next.]
;W[dp]WL[1791.192]LB[eq:A]C[Since I'm on move behind in the fuseki, I opted for the star point instead of a move like A (E3) [ which would reduce the development potential of the bottom\] since it allows me more flexibility and can develop faster.]
;B[fc]BL[1762.844]LB[od:A]C[Black's approach here protects from an easy approach at A (P16) for me.]
;W[cf]WL[1785.599]LB[hc:A][oc:B]C[I debated the pincer at A (H17), but the top didn't seem very interesting since Black could easily negate the development potential with a corner enclosure like B (P17).]
;B[db]BL[1755.554]C[When Black dives here, I felt it was too early to respond yet since I wasn't sure how the game was going to develop.]
;W[po]WL[1768.242]C[So I tenuki to see what Black is planning on doing.]
;B[qm]BL[1743.268]C[I must admit that although this pincer is quite common, I have very little experience/knowledge with it. ]
;W[on]WL[1737.35]LB[qq:A]C[The fact that my go to move in this position is this kosumi (which is outdated) goes to show how little I've studied it. Haha. For those wondering, the most common response these days is A (R3). ]
;B[mq]BL[1723.177]C[Black takes his two space extension.]
;W[qq]WL[1705.14]C[So I have no choice but to attach in order to settle my group.]
;B[qr]BL[1705.845]C[Black hanes as expected.]
;W[qp]WL[1698.927]C[So I pull back to keep my stones connected.]
;B[qj]BL[1690.269]C[Black now settles his other group with another two space extension.]
;W[rr]WL[1673.312]C[So I better settle my group before it becomes a floating group that gets chased around the board.]
;B[or]BL[1665.924]C[Black plays the tiger mouth (which follows the joskei).]
;W[qs]WL[1661.369]LB[rs:A]C[And then I atari to prevent Black from the dangerous hane of A (S1).]
;B[fq]BL[1660.005]LB[jq:A]C[Black normally just extends to A (K3) now, but he deviates with this approach move.]
;W[cn]WL[1639.21]LB[hq:A]TR[mq][pq][or][qr]C[I debated the pincer at A (H3) once again, but I felt that I would create a weak group since Black already had strength with the marked group (N3). So the calm knight's response felt appropriate.]
;B[cc]BL[1656.554]LB[ci:A]C[To my surprise, Black takes the corner now. And while I was very tempted to submit to Black and just settle with A (C11), I felt it would be too good to let Black get exactly what he wanted.]
;W[hq]WL[1630.278]C[So I decided to take the initiatve on the bottom, but in hindsight, this may have been an overplay.]
;B[jq]BL[1640.838]TR[fq]C[Black's extension here took me by surprise, but it was a nice way to settle his group while also treating the marked (F3) stone lightly.]
;W[gp]WL[1595.128]LB[fp:A]C[So I opt for this kosumi to try and smother the stone, but I think this might actually be bad shape. I probably should have just attached with A (F4) directly).]
;B[cq]BL[1630.42]C[Black dives into the corner as expected.]
;W[dq]WL[1592.223]C[Letting Black settle easily after investing so many moves was unthinkable to me at the time, so blocking here was the only option.]
;B[bp]BL[1590.48]C[I don't have much experience with this diagonal, so I tried to see if there was a way to kill it.]
;W[cr]WL[1574.313]C[I decided that trying to kill it was the wrong way to think, and decided to switch gears and aim to simply seal Black in sente.]
;B[br]BL[1583.78]C[Black blocks.]
;W[cp]WL[1572.121]C[So I start with the forcing atari here.]
;B[bq]BL[1580.916]C[Black must connect.]
;W[dr]WL[1567.989]C[And then I connect to keep Black still struggling for life.]
;B[bn]BL[1578.569]C[Black attaches to expand his eye space.]
;W[bm]WL[1562.379]C[And now I begin my plan to seal Black in.]
;B[co]BL[1566.805]C[Black threatens to break out.]
;W[do]WL[1551.75]C[So I atari and seal him in as planned.]
;B[bo]BL[1565.426]C[Black connects.]
;W[dm]WL[1539.721]LB[bs:A]C[And then I connect knowing full well that Black needed to descend at A (B1) to live.]
;B[bs]BL[1561.032]C[And as planned, Black makes life and I get sente. At this point though, I was feeling behind since it felt that Black had a bit of solid territory.]
;W[di]WL[1510.722]TR[dd][cf]SQ[bm][dm][cn]C[Nonetheless, I could not neglect my marked group (D16) and thus chose this move which acted as a reinforcement to the group while also serving as an extension to my thickness at C6 (square).]
;B[ck]BL[1545.071]C[And Black promptly invades! Ah!]
;W[dk]WL[1506.618]C[So my first plan was to keep him sealed in while building influence for a potential moyo later.]
;B[cl]BL[1536.079]C[Black peep here is expected.]
;W[cm]WL[1496.875]C[And I have to connect in order to keep Black focused on making life.]
;B[bl]BL[1499.865]C[Black plays here to threaten to connect, but this is a good example of how inadvertently trying to help one group can damage another group.]
;W[an]WL[1490.65]C[My hane here does not quite kill the B1 group (triangle) yet, but it sets up a possible kill later on.]
;B[dl]BL[1492.984]C[Black pushes through.]
;W[el]WL[1476.49]C[And I keep with my plan to keep Black sealed in.]
;B[cj]BL[1485.572]C[Black simply extends.]
;W[dj]WL[1468.899]C[So I connect my stones to repair my cutting points while continuing to put pressure on Black.]
;B[bg]BL[1473.079]C[Black then slides to make a base, but there is a weakness in this shape that White can take advantage of. Can you see it?]
;W[bi]WL[1421.124]C[Correct. And for those who don't see why, you'll see the beauty of this move in a little bit.]
;B[ci]BL[1460.34]C[Black pushes to cut.]
;W[ch]WL[1417.415]C[I block.]
;B[bh]BL[1455.495]C[And then Black cuts, but believe it or not, White will win this capturing race.]
;W[bj]WL[1415.066]C[If you look now, Black only has 2 liberties while White actually has 3.]
;B[cg]BL[1454.166]C[Black plays the forcing move here that threatens to save his stones.]
;W[dh]WL[1410.874]C[So I connect.]
;B[ai]BL[1449.828]LB[ak:B][bk:C][al:A]C[Black's hane here threatens to win the capturing race. While there are multiple options to choose from, there is one that is the best. Which would you choose?]
;W[ak]WL[1380.269]C[Yup. This is the one you should choose. Wondering why? Just you wait.]
;B[dg]BL[1413.968]TR[dd][cf]C[Black cuts off the D16 stones (triangle) and starts to make what looks like a rather large corner. However, there is one area he's neglecting. Any idea what I'm referring to?]
;W[ao]WL[1366.999]TR[ak]C[Yup. This corner now dies because of the A9 (triangle) stone. You'll see why shortly.]
;B[ap]BL[1374.92]C[Black blocks now.]
;W[ar]WL[1354.815]C[So White must play on the vital point to keep Black at one eye.]
;B[am]BL[1370.152]TR[ci][cj][ck][bl][cl][dl]C[Black captures and it looks like he's connected up with the C11 group (triangle), but it's not true.]
;W[an]WL[1352.374]LB[al:A]C[White can throw-in because Black connecting at A (A8) would be self-atari. ]
;B[ao]BL[1366.491]TR[bi][bj][ak]C[While it looks like Black is just about to save the group since White's B11 stones (triangle) look like they're in trouble, White has a move that will stop Black in his tracks. Can you see it?]
;W[al]WL[1350.409]LB[ak:A]TR[ci][cj][ck][bl][cl][dl][am][bn][ao][bo][co][ap][bp][bq][cq][br][bs]C[With this move, you can see the value of A (A9) since it allows this cut which kills all of Black's stones (triangle).]
;B[ff]BL[1356.123]C[Black now starts to solidify his corner (which looks quite big) while threatening to form a large moyo on top. So the question to you is this, what move would you play to deal with the top?]
;W[kc]WL[1290.219]LB[od:A]SQ[fc][ff]C[I agree. Playing here is better than an approach move to the upper right corner because Black would have the chance to pincer which would work beautifully with the impending thickness at F14 (square).]
;B[ps]BL[1351.954]C[To my surprise, Black decides to fight a ko now.]
;W[pr]WL[1272.281]C[The general rule of thumb when an opponent threatens to start a ko is to always take the ko regardless of whether it's worth fighting since it will remove one ko threat from your opponent.]
;B[em]BL[1348.929]TR[bm][cm][dm][cn]C[Black ataris the marked group (C7).]
;W[bk]WL[1268.463]C[So I go ahead and capture to rmove the aji of the stones.]
;B[qr]BL[1346.994]C[Black takes the ko.]
;W[eg]WL[1251.299]LB[ef:A]C[So I hane to threaten the extension at A (D14) which would reduce Black's large corner significantly.]
;B[ef]BL[1342.8]C[Black blocks as expected.]
;W[pr]WL[1249.275]C[So I go ahead and take the ko again.]
;B[cs]BL[1322.839]C[When Black extends here, I stopped for a minute as I was wondering if there was a way for him to save the group.]
;W[os]WL[1240.579]C[But after reading a few variations, I decided it wasn't possible and ended the ko.]
;B[ds]BL[1320.394]C[Black now embarked to prove me wrong. ]
;W[fr]WL[1214.046]C[I look for the most efficient way possible to prevent his group from living and choose this one point jump. ]
;B[er]BL[1298.634]C[When Black continues his endeavor to save his group, I'm thinking, "Please tell me I'm not wrong..."]
;W[gr]WL[1183.581]C[Extend in order to prevent Black from gaining his second eye.]
;B[eq]BL[1276.482]LB[eo:C][fo:D][hp:B][gq:A]C[Black connects all his stones and now I'm concerned about weaknesses around A (G3), B (H4), C (E5) and D (F5).]
;W[fo]WL[1152.258]C[So I go ahead and strengthen my connections with this kosumi.]
;B[mc]BL[1260.995]C[Black then decides to return to the top with this attack.]
;W[hc]WL[1145.79]C[I calmly extend two spaces as predicted, but am keeping in mind that I may not be able to save all my stones and intend on playing lightly if needed.]
;B[le]BL[1247.113]C[Black keeps up his attack with the knight's move.]
;W[he]WL[1134.384]LB[fd:A]C[So I one point jump to reinforce my stones while looking at possibilities of the attachment at A (F16).]
;B[nl]BL[1233.189]LB[id:A]C[To be honest, I half expected the peep at A (J16), but I understand Black's intention on trying to form a large upper right moyo to try and compensave for his loss in the lower left.]
;W[mm]WL[1115.265]TR[jq][mq][pq][or]C[I thought about reducing immediately, but decided to strengthen my influence in this area in hopes of slowly strangling the K3 group (triangle).]
;B[ml]BL[1227.206]C[Black pushes.]
;W[lm]WL[1106.587]C[I extend.]
;B[kk]BL[1225.046]C[Black jumps to stay ahead of the race, but now I'm starting to realize that those exchanges were not really in my favor. After all, I just helped Black build more influence to solidify the moyo he wants to make. Hmm.. what to do...]
;W[qc]WL[1102.452]LB[mc:A][qd:B]C[Since the relationship between the A (N17) and B (R16) stone is so loose, I decided that the attachment here was a great way to start my invasion into his moyo.]
;B[pc]BL[1219.511]C[Black hanes.]
;W[rd]WL[1096.272]C[So I hane.]
;B[qb]BL[1210.582]LB[rc:A]C[Black ataris here, but I have no intention of connection at A (R17) and creating a heavy group for myself.]
;W[qe]WL[1094.492]C[So I counter-atari right back to start a sequence to gain sabaki (i.e., eye shape).]
;B[rc]BL[1209.031]C[Black captures, so there is only one move to play.]
;W[pd]WL[1093.002]LB[qc:A][qh:B]C[That's right. Threatening to start a ko is a great way to try and gain eye shape. 

If you are worried about Black connecting at A (R17), White would then extend to B (R12) and find ways to poke at Black's weaknesses to make sabaki and eventually life since Black is not that strong in the center yet.]
;B[re]BL[1183.595]C[I was only too happy to fight a ko since it meant I would definitely gain something somewhere.]
;W[qc]WL[1090.639]C[Let the ko fight begin!]
;B[jd]BL[1182.084]C[Black threatens to cut apart my stones here, but I determined that responding to this threat would only make my group heavier which would inadvertently result in giving Black more ko threats.]
;W[rf]WL[1067.644]C[so I chose to ignore make the atari here since I wanted a base in Black's moyo as opposed to taking the corner.]
;B[qd]BL[1177.809]C[Black takes the ko .]
;W[se]WL[1059.433]C[So I go ahead and capture and have a pretty good chance at living now.]
;B[pe]BL[1173.589]C[Black continues to put pressure on my group since it's not fully alive.]
;W[qc]WL[1038.743]C[So I take the ko again to see what Black has in mind.]
;B[ir]BL[1141.64]C[When Black plays here, I stared at this area for quite awhile as I tried to see the various ways Black could possibly connect his groups up.]
;W[qd]WL[979.924]C[After much deliberation, I decided that it wasn't possible and ended the ko.]
;B[gq]BL[1138.732]LB[hp:A]C[Black now embarks on the sequence that gave me concern earlier by aiming for the cut at A (H4).]
;W[hr]WL[972.972]C[I connect and hope that I read out the cut correctly.]
;B[hp]BL[1137.475]C[Black cuts as expected.]
;W[iq]WL[959.3]LB[io:A][jr:B]C[And I push here with the intention of having A (J5) and B (K2) as miai.]
;B[eo]BL[1125.935]LB[go:A]C[Black then plays this interesting wedge that gives me pause for the correct move. If you look carefully, there is a weakness with the atari at A (G5) if White is not careful.]
;W[ep]WL[938.108]LB[go:A][fp:B]C[After careful verification of my reading, I decide on this cut because the atari at A (G5) will not create additional weakness and this cut prevents the cut at B (F4) because it would be self-atari for Black.]
;B[es]BL[1092.147]LB[fp:A]C[Black connects and now threatens the cut / double-atari of A (F4).]
;W[fp]WL[884.095]C[So naturally I connect.]
;B[jr]BL[1089.516]C[Moment of truth. Here is where I was worried that Black would try to connect on the first line by taking advantage of a shortage of liberty situation. ]
;W[io]WL[809.021]C[But after staring at the board for over a minute, I realized that I was going to be alright. Success!]
;B[jp]BL[1038.651]TR[hq][iq][fr][gr][hr]C[Black's extension here threatens to cut off my H2 stones (triangle) and capture them.]
;W[ip]WL[804.719]C[So I clearly have to connect.]
;B[oc]BL[1020.02]C[Black extension here is very big since it prevent White from swallowing up a big chunk of the corner.]
;W[nr]WL[788.049]C[With all my groups safe however, I decided to attack Black's remaining weak group on the bottom with this atari.]
;B[kn]BL[1014.727]C[When Black jump here, I immediately get the sense that I will be unable to kill this group.]
;W[km]WL[784.172]C[Oh well, might as well harass it for a bit.]
;B[jn]BL[1011.131]C[Black extends.]
;W[im]WL[692.456]C[I sit for a while and debate on how I want to try and seal Black in and end up deciding on this one point jump, but it's full of cutting points and probably not the best one.]
;B[mo]BL[982.783]LB[nm:A]C[Black makes some shape while threatening the cut around A (O7).]
;W[nm]WL[679.5]C[Seeing as how I have little interest in creating a weak group this late in the game, I went ahead and connecting my stones up.]
;B[mr]BL[947.926]C[Black then prevents White from jumping in to undermine his base.]
;W[lp]WL[669.752]C[And then I impulsively jump in thinking that I might be able to create dead eye space.]
;B[mp]BL[945.18]C[After Black connects however, I realize that his eye space is actually quite large and I am probably best just leaving it alone for ko threats later on.]
;W[fd]WL[595.542]C[So I go ahead and attach here as I originally intended to see what Black's intentions are.]
;B[jc]BL[882.085]TR[kc]C[To my surprise, he ignores me and cuts off the L17 stone (triangle); but I'm not worried since I was treating all the stones in this area lightly to begin with.]
;W[ec]WL[582.314]TR[db][cc]C[So I hane to strengthen my connection and begin harrassing the corner group (triangle).]
;B[fb]BL[875.821]C[Black descends to stay connected.]
;W[df]WL[573.546]C[No problem. I'll just cut here and see how Black wants to handle this.]
;B[fg]BL[866.41]C[Black starts with an atari as a forcing move.]
;W[eh]WL[568.323]C[No choice but to respond in order to keep Black severed.]
;B[bf]BL[864.733]C[Black now embarks to save his group.]
;W[be]WL[561.225]C[I decided to hane here because I thought I could win the capturing race.]
;B[ce]BL[843.965]LB[de:A]C[When Black cuts however, I verify my reading once again and realize that I would be short a liberty if I simply connected at A (D15). Good thing for me there's another option I can take.]
;W[cd]WL[532.769]C[Switch directions! Time to attack the corner instead!]
;B[de]BL[842.407]C[Black captures.]
;W[bc]WL[530.226]C[But I now get chance at capturing Black's corner and group!]
;B[bb]BL[830.91]C[Black hanes to make eye shape.]
;W[eb]WL[509.209]TR[fb][fc]C[So I threaten to capture the F18 stones (triangle) in order to secure my own group.]
;B[ea]BL[825.149]C[Black will have none of that and connects.]
;W[dc]WL[488.522]C[In order to keep Black's eye space to a minimum, I use the forcing atari here now since this move is also a forcing atari for Black since it would atari the E18 stones (triangle). And like the proverb goes, "Your opponent's good point is your good point!"]
;B[cb]BL[823.456]LB[ab:A][hb:C][gd:B]C[Black connects as expected. And though many might want to instinctively play A (A18) to keep Black at no eyes, I felt that I had too many weaknesses (like B (G16) and C (H18)) to successfully kill Black.]
;W[gc]WL[478.271]C[So I repaired my connections first before embarking on a path to try and kill Black.]
;B[ac]BL[801.177]C[Black's atari here was expected, and there is only one move that White should make. What is it?]
(;W[ad]WL[469.275]C[Correct. The ko is a great result for White since this area was previously Black's corner and now White has a chance to not only destroy it but to also capture Black as well. 

If you thought that White should have connected at A (B16) instead, go back to Move 155 and click on B16 to see why it doesn't work.]
;B[bd]BL[799.137]C[And Black takes the first ko.]
;W[jo]WL[449.364]C[Remember how I left this group for harassing later? Perfect time for ko threats!]
;B[nq]BL[752.333]LB[ko:A]C[Black defends nicely with this atari which would settle his group in one move as opposed to simply blocking at A (L5).]
;W[bc]WL[443.358]C[So I take the ko.]
;B[ee]BL[713.012]LB[ed:A]C[Black is threatening the cut at A (E16). And after some reading, I decide that I would most likely be unable to win the capturing race if I let Black cut.]
;W[ed]WL[419.592]C[And since I still have some threats on the bottom, I see no harm in connecting.]
;B[bd]BL[709.606]C[Black takes back the ko.]
;W[oq]WL[411.093]C[With this capture, Black is once again in a precarious situation.]
;B[ko]BL[666.991]C[So Black blocks and maintains his large eye space.]
;W[bc]WL[407.677]C[And I take back the ko.]
;B[gd]BL[646.652]C[I almost responded immediately to Black's cut here immediately, but what you should always ask yourself before responding to your opponent's whim is the following question: Do I really have to answer?]
;W[ab]WL[390.491]C[After some thought and reading, I decided that I could actually ignored Black and end the ko. Pay attention to the sequence that is about to follow.]
;B[fe]BL[644.973]C[Black ataris as expected.]
;W[bd]WL[388.573]LB[ge:A]C[And while White has to connect, White currently has a chance to connect back to his stones with A (G15).]
;B[ge]BL[633.274]C[This means that Black has to repair the cutting point, but this leaves White with the sente needed to win the capturing race.]
;W[gb]WL[381.503]LB[fa:A]C[And with this turn, Black has no opportunity for even a ko fight. The capturing race is finished. 

If you don't believe me though, click on A (F19) to see the continuation.]
(;B[hd]BL[623.263]TR[he]C[So Black cuts off the H15 stone (triangle), but once again, I was treating the stones in this area lightly, so I wasn't worried about the H15 stone (triangle).]
;W[ib]WL[355.43]TR[kc]C[So I make this kosumi (i.e., diagonal) since it let me gain some more liberties, expand my territory, and threaten to save the L17 stone (triangle) which Black had spent two moves trying to capture (which meant it was likely he would respond and I would get sente).]
;B[jb]BL[610.465]C[Black blocks as expected, but now I can tenuki.]
;W[pg]WL[336.437]C[With the only large remaining area on the board being the center, I decided it was time for me to embark and destroying it in the safest way possible since I did not want to give Black a chance to reverse the game.]
;B[hj]BL[602.417]C[Black ignores to try and widen the his moyo.]
;W[mg]WL[311.195]LB[pl:A]C[I decide to play a looser two point jump here then to continue destroying Black's moyo since any attempt by Black to cut off that stone would give me the power needed for me to aim at the weaknesses around A (Q8).]
;B[lh]BL[591.524]C[Black makes a close contact player to try and solidify some of his moyo.]
;W[lg]WL[301.849]C[So I go ahead and push to create some cutting points.]
;B[kg]BL[589.429]C[Black blocks.]
;W[kh]WL[272.525]LB[kf:A][li:B]C[So I immediately cut to create weaknesses in the shape to give me a miai for A (L14) and B (M11).]
;B[kf]BL[581.545]LB[li:A]C[Black fixes the atari as expected. And I'm sure some of you are wondering why I was thinking of A (M11) as a possibility since the ladder worked for Black.]
;W[pj]WL[263.815]C[Well the fun thing about ladders is that they are conditional on ladder breakers. And when it comes to making ladder breakers, it's pretty easy to make them when you can use powerful moves like attaching where Black is strong.]
;B[mh]BL[579.234]C[Black tries to resist against the ladder.]
;W[nh]WL[260.715]C[I hane to keep Black's liberties at a minimum.]
;B[ni]BL[565.659]C[Black hanes.]
;W[mi]WL[248.372]TR[kh]C[But now I decide to sacrifice the L12 stone (triangle) for bigger profit by starting with this atari.]
;B[li]BL[564.04]C[Black extends.]
;W[oi]WL[245.869]C[And now I can atari once again.]
;B[mj]BL[557.415]C[Black captures, but now I have sente for a powerful follow-up move. What would you play?]
;W[qk]WL[238.613]LB[ng:A][oh:B]C[I agree. The cutting points at A (A13) and B (P12) are negligible at this point since they can be viewed as forcing moves to gain territory in an area that was previously Black's.]
;B[pk]BL[546.636]C[Black crosscuts to create complications.]
;W[pl]WL[229.426]C[The atari from this direction is the only option to keep Black as separated as possible.]
;B[rk]BL[536.039]C[Black counter-ataris.]
;W[ql]WL[226.181]C[So I connect to save my cutting stone.]
;B[rl]BL[532.331]C[And with this extension, it becomes clear that Black is trying to make life for his group.]
;W[qi]WL[205.475]C[So I make this atari to strengthen my stone's connection while seeing if there are any possibilities to killing the group (but I am not expecting to kill it).]
;B[pm]BL[519.018]LB[ok:A][ol:B]C[Black makes the atari here, but I have no intention of simply capturing at A (P9) since it would let Black connect his stones up with the follow-up atari at B (P8).]
;W[ol]WL[192.904]C[So I take that point and keep Black cut off.]
;B[ro]BL[502.366]C[Black slides to try and widen his eye space. Now the question becomes, can White kill Black?]
;W[rm]WL[161.596]LB[rp:A]C[To be honest the block at A (S4) was the first thing that came to mind, but my instincts told me to cut and that's what I decided to do.]
(;B[rj]BL[482.194]LB[sm:B][rn:A]C[Black decides to connect here and you'll see the resulting sequence in the game, but for those curious about the variations coming from Black responding at A (S6) and B (T7), go back to Move 202 to and click on them to see how Black dies.]
;W[qn]WL[142.804]C[I can't say for certain this is the most efficient way to kill Black, but as far as I could tell, this was at least a sure kill.]
;B[rn]BL[480.718]C[Black cuts.]
;W[sm]WL[139.957]LB[sm:A]C[So I extend to not only destroy eyespace but to keep the potential eye at A (T7) false.]
;B[sl]BL[475.904]C[Black tries to make eyes.]
;W[ri]WL[131.118]C[When killing a group, focus on minimizing eye space so they have little room to wriggle.]
;B[sn]BL[458.125]LB[sj:A][rm:B][sp:C]C[Black captures. And on second analysis, I just realized that Black is already dead in this position. White can tenuki since White has three ways (A (T10), B (S7), and C (T4)) to falsify Black's second eye.]
;W[rm]WL[124.727]C[I didn't notice mid-game however, and threw-in anyways.]
;B[ok]BL[425.371]C[Black ataris.]
;W[om]WL[117.873]C[So I connect.]
;B[ph]BL[422.396]C[Black now is trying to generate some aji, so my goal was to find a move that would eliminate the most aji possible.]
;W[oh]WL[101.473]LB[pi:A]C[Removing this atari with this connection seemed to be the best option since Black would also be unable to atari at A (Q11) since it would be self-atari.]
;B[sj]BL[374.309]LB[sp:A]C[Black makes an eye, but Black cannot make a second eye because of White's attachment at A (T4).]
;W[ik]WL[47.045]C[So I tenuki and set off and reducing Black's largest area.]
;B[ij]BL[355.693]C[Black blocks.]
;W[gi]WL[36.609]C[And now I reduce from another direction.]
;B[hn]BL[327.864]C[When Black plays here, I paused as I was a bit concerned that I would get caught off guard and accidentally die.]
;W[in]WL[17.234]C[But the simple connection here was enough to keep my stones safe.]
;B[gl]BL[325.117]C[Black now attemps to connect up his stones. And while this can be seen as Black destroying White's area, I never intended on this area being territory to begin with, so I wasn't too worried.]
;W[hm]WL[6.668]C[I decided to go with the solid turn to minimize any cutting aji.]
;B[fm]BL[314.299]LB[en:A]C[Black connects out and probably expects White to capture at A (E6), but I saw a weakness in Black's own connection.]
;W[hk]WL[30]OW[3]C[This knight's move is weak and can be cut.]
;B[gj]BL[311.338]TR[gl][em][fm][hn][eo][hp]SQ[gi]C[When Black extends, I was given a choice between cutting off the F7 stones (triangle) or letting Black cutt off the G11 stone (square).]
;W[gh]WL[30]OW[3]C[Since letting Black connect his stones would not gain him any points, I felt that saving the reducing stone was bigger and more valuable.]
;B[gk]BL[292.473]C[Thus Black had to connect.]
;W[ih]WL[30]OW[3]C[And so I continue my mission to destroy Black's territory.]
;B[nf]BL[276.908]LB[ng:A]C[Black now peeps at the cut at A (O13), but White has a better move than simply connecting.]
;W[ki]WL[30]OW[3]LB[ng:A]C[This descent here asks Black whether Black should simply cut at A (O13).]
;B[hh]BL[220.402]C[Black has other plans though since he notices that my connections aren't very strong and can actually be cut.]
;W[hi]WL[30]OW[3]C[I atari and threaten to connect.]
;B[ii]BL[219.134]C[Black cuts.]
;W[hg]WL[30]OW[3]C[So I capture.]
;B[jh]BL[217.916]C[While this cut looks successful, White has a devastating follow up move. Can you see it?]
;W[lj]WL[30]OW[3]C[That's right. This atari is very painful.]
;B[mi]BL[215.918]C[Black can connect.]
;W[mk]WL[30]OW[3]LB[nj:A]C[But if you read a few moves further, you'll see that it is inescapable. 

And if you can't read it yet, click on A (O10) to see the rest of the sequence.]
(;B[ji]BL[170.263]TR[jh][ii][gj][hj][ij][gk][gl][em][fm]C[Black realizes it is futil and embarks to save connect his K12 group (triangle) since it doesn't have any eyes.]
;W[nj]WL[30]OW[3]LB[jg:A]C[So I capture the stones to remove their aji and gain sente since Black still needs fix the cut at A (K13).]
;B[ig]BL[168.029]C[Black chooses the atari to fix the cut, but the impending ko was not dangerous to me at the moment.]
;W[if]WL[30]OW[3]C[So I went ahead and count atari'd.]
;B[jg]BL[166.583]C[Black connected, and then I noticed a connection conundrum for Black. Can you see it?]
;W[id]WL[30]OW[3]TR[gd][hd][ce][de][ee][fe][ge][bf][ef][ff][bg][cg][dg][fg][bh][ai]C[With this atari, White protects all his cutting points and also cuts off the H16 stones (triangle).]
;B[ic]BL[160.354]C[Black cuts.]
;W[ie]WL[30]OW[3]C[I connect.]
;B[ga]BL[156.155]LB[id:A]C[And then Black tries to save his stones, but I had this read out already when I played A (J16).]
;W[fa]WL[30]OW[3]C[I start by capturing.]
;B[fb]BL[154.65]C[Black captures back.]
;W[ha]WL[30]OW[3]C[But then I end all hopes of saving his stones with this atari.]
;B[gg]BL[123.137]LB[hf:A]C[Black's move here was surprising to me as I didn't account for this. And for those who don't see it, Black is planning on starting a ko by throing in at A (H14).]
;W[hh]WL[30]OW[3]C[I felt that Black had quite a few ko threats around the board, so I decided to cut my losses by connecting this ko first.]
;B[hf]BL[121.45]C[As predicted, Black starts a ko.]
;W[gf]WL[30]OW[3]C[And though I wasn't planning on winning this, I was at least going to take the ko at least once.]
;B[ja]BL[64.074]C[When Black descends here, to be honest, White could technically ignore this threat. However, that would lead to another ko which I wasn't sure I could win at the time. And with the game coming close to an end, I was pretty tired from all the reading and did not want to accidentally gamble away my advantage.]
;W[fc]WL[30]OW[3]C[So I went ahead and responded.]
;B[hf]BL[60.635]C[Black took the ko, but I felt that it wasn't worth fighting since I wanted to end the game without contest.]
;W[rb]WL[30]OW[3]C[So I went to on to take more territory.]
;B[ra]BL[48.124]C[Black ataris.]
;W[sc]WL[30]OW[3]LB[pb:A]C[So I captured knowing that Black should repair his cut at A (Q18).]
;B[jk]BL[33.975]TR[kk]C[To my surprsie he ignores me, and saves his L9 stone (triangle).]
;W[od]WL[30]OW[3]C[So I go ahead and further reduce the top with this push.]
;B[nd]BL[28.719]C[Black blocks as expected.]
;W[pb]WL[30]OW[3]C[But now this cut works.]
;B[pa]BL[26.178]C[Black can try to start a ko.]
;W[ob]WL[30]OW[3]TR[oc][pc]C[But White can just extend and atari the P17 stones (triangle).]
;B[nc]BL[18.417]C[Black has to connect.]
;W[oa]WL[30]OW[3]C[And then White turns and captures a larger corner.]
;B[nb]BL[14.31]C[The only downside is that Black has this forcing atari.]
;W[qa]WL[30]OW[3]C[And White has to capture and end in gote, but I was pretty sure this was quite big endgame wise.]
;B[gn]BL[30]OB[3]LB[ho:A]C[Black pulls out here his stone here, but instead of simply capturing at A (H5), there is a better move. What is it?]
;W[gm]WL[30]OW[3]LB[fl:A]C[Correct. Black has connection issues and this threatens the cut at A (F8).]
;B[fl]BL[30]OB[3]C[So Black connects.]
;W[fn]WL[30]OW[3]TR[gn][hn][hp]C[And now White can capture all three stones (triangle).]
;B[en]BL[30]OB[3]C[Black saves his E5 stone (triangle), but White should tenuki now since there are bigger points left on the board.]
;W[ll]WL[30]OW[3]TR[ml][nl]C[I go ahead and secure the capture of the N8 stones (triangle).]
;B[oe]BL[30]OB[3]TR[pe]C[Black saves his Q15 stone (triangle).]

;W[ho]WL[30]OW[3]C[So White has to capture.]
;B[lq]BL[30]OB[3]C[Black now starts making living shape.]
;W[ln]WL[30]OW[3]TR[lp]C[Since I couldn't see a way to kill Black, my goal was to just minimize the territory in sente with moves like this that threatens to save the M4 stone (triangle). ]
;B[lo]BL[30]OB[3]C[Black connects.]

;B[ls]BL[30]OB[3]C[Black makes his second eye.]
;W[jm]WL[30]OW[3]C[And then I connect here because I become paranoid and thinking the H2 group could die (which it can't since it alreayd has two eyes). After this connection however, Black resigns.])
