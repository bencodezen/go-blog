;B[qc]C[I don't get to play against 3-3 very often, but I'm grateful to Bonscott for favoring this opening move since it gives me some experience playing against it. For those who haven't run into it in their own games, the key thing to realize is that Black is claiming the corner and is starting off the game territorially.]
;W[dp]C[As many of you know, I'm more of a fan of influence and moyos. Therefore, to counteract the territorial style that Black has set forth, the star point on the opposite side is an easy choice for me (since it does not allow Black to make a cross-fuseki which would be advantageous to his territorial style).]
;B[pq]C[Black chooses the 3-4 with the strong side facing my stone.]
;W[dd]C[I'm not concerned with a competing moyo, so I go ahead and take another star point for maximum influence and moyo potential.]
;B[qo]LB[jq:A]C[Black's enclosure here practically seals the deal in terms of his approach for this game: territorial. As White however, I was faced with a decision on how to best approach this. Maybe an extension at like A (K3) to negate the shimari's power?]
;W[pd]C[I decided to go ahead and play out the 3-3 joseki here to see what direction Black wanted.]
;B[pc]C[Black extends as in the joseki.]
;W[od]C[So I naturally extend to keep my stones strong.]
;B[re]LB[oc:B][pg:A]C[And then Black slides to enlarge his corner. At this point, I consider continuing with the joseki of A (Q13) or B (P17), but felt that it was best to tenuki to see how Black wanted to progress the game.]
;W[dj]LB[fq:A]C[So I made the "ultimate" moyo formation (and by that I mean fastest developing if given the opportunity). And at this point, I was fully expecting an approach at A (F3).]
(;B[er]C[To my surprise, Black chooses a rather unorthodox approach. This is normally meant as an invasion in certain circumstances and not a standard approach move. To see the continuation I was expecting, go back to Move 10 and click on F3.]
;W[dr]C[So I go ahead and attach to give myself a big corner while expecting Black to gain a bit of thickness for the bottom.]
;B[ep]LB[eq:A]C[Black's attachment here surprised me yet again because it leaves a weakness at A (E3).]
;W[eq]C[It didn't take me long to think about exploiting this weakness and create cutting points within Black's shape.]
;B[fq]C[Black blocks.]
;W[dq]LB[fp:A][fr:B]C[And now White gets to solid shape and a very large corner while Black still has two cutting points (A (F4) and B (F2)) to worry about. Too good for White.]
;B[fp]LB[fr:B]C[Black defends the correct cutting point since B (F2) is small.]
;W[eo]C[So I go ahead and hane since this is an area of mutual interest for both parties. In other words, this area is the junction for both player's to expand their moyo.]
;B[fo]C[Black pushes and gains thickness that gives me some concern due to his shimari in the lower right.]
;W[en]C[However, I am gaining 5th line territory at this rate and have nothing to complain about. After all, I can always invade and fight (which I so immensely enjoy).]
;B[pf]LB[jp:A][kp:B]C[Black now tries to capitalize on White's tenuki from earlier, but this is a bit of an overplay. Instead, Black's thickness in the lower left really needs an extension like A (K4) or B (L4).]
;W[jd]C[I was feeling kind of ambitious at this point of the game, so I went ahead and took another large point to really get my sanrensei going. Got to love me some influence.]
;B[cc]C[As expected, Black invades at the 3-3. Where would you block?]
;W[cd]LB[pc:A]C[I decided to block this direction because my top side is already undercut by Black's stone at A (Q17).]
;B[bd]C[To my surprise, Black deviates from the 3-3 invasion joseki and hanes immediately. The following sequence is one that you should pay attention to if you ever wondered what "punishing" joseki mistakes ends up looking like.]
;W[be]C[I go ahead and start by blocking Black's hane.]
;B[bc]C[Black connects.]
;W[dc]C[And now White can restrict Black's space.]
;B[db]C[Black hanes to gain eye space.]
;W[eb]C[White hanes and blocks again.]
;B[ab]C[Black starts making living shape.]
;W[cb]LB[ba:A][bf:B]C[To be honest, I'm not sure this is the correct move. While I know that A (B19) looks like it can kill White, you have to consider how to hande Black's clamp at B (B14). So instead of risking letting Black run amok and live, I chose this move since it was simple and ensure that I would would seal Black in in sente.]
;B[bf]C[Black realizes his predicament and clamps as expected.]
;W[ae]C[When White descends here, it looks like Black is dead; but he is not dead yet!]
;B[ce]C[Black cuts as expected.]
;W[cf]C[So I go ahead and cut as well.]
;B[de]C[Black extends.]
;W[bg]TR[bf]C[And now I secure my stones by capturing the B14 stone (triangle).]
;B[ad]C[Did you see this forcing move? If not, this kind of move that gives Black an eye in sente is one you should try to watch out for when solving your own life and death problems.]
;W[af]C[This was within my calculations however, so I happily captured and awaited Black's next move to live.]
;B[ba]LB[bb:A]C[Black makes his second eye and lives since White cannot play A (B18) without putting himself in self-atari.]
;W[da]TR[ba][ab][bc][cc][ad][bd]C[However, this capture here is sente since now White can falsify Black's eye and kill the entire B19 group (triangle).]
;B[ca]LB[bb:A][db:B]C[So Black defends his eye, but this is inferior to simply connecting at A (B18) since it gives White the ko threat / sente play of connecting at B (D18).

Now back to my discussion earlier regarding "punishing joseki mistakes" and inferior results, it should be very apparent that Black's result is inferior. And if not, notice the following: 

(1) Black has only two points after playing 7 stones.
(2) Black's stones are completely sealed in and will have little to no impact on the remainder of the game.
(3) White has gained influence on both sides that is practically guaranteed a much better result than Black's territory.
(4) Black ended in gote.

Always remember that joseki is about getting an even result for both players at the end of the sequence. This is not an equal result.]
;W[kq]LB[hq:A][nq:B]C[With sente and all my groups quite stable, I felt it was important that I break up Black's bottom area since it was the largest area that was still in contest on the board. And in case there are people wondering why I played here, it gives me a miai of A (H3) and B (O3) for a two-space extension.

The question to the reader however is: Which direction should Black approach from?]
;B[mq]TR[qo][pq]SQ[fo][ep][fp][fq]C[Black chose this direction in the game, however, this is the incorrect direction to approach from since Black's corner is already strong since Black has a shimari (triangle). Black's stones at F3 (square), on the other hand, have no base and are weaker. Thus, by approaching from this direction, Black is hurting his stones.]
;W[hq]SQ[fo][ep][fp][fq][er]C[When White extends here, it should become apparent how weak Black's F3 stones (square) are now.]
;B[gm]C[Black tries to run out into the center with this knight's move. And while this might look like proper haengma (i.e., stone movement) in this situation, you should always check whether or not you can be cut when playing a move like this.]
;W[fn]C[With my H3 stones (triangle) sitting there as perfect ladder breakers, I decided to cut immediately.]
;B[gn]C[Black descends.]
;W[go]LB[ho:A]C[And then I cut as I planned. 

Now the question is this: As Black, can you atari from A (H5)? If you think you can, go ahead and click on A (H5).]
(;B[gp]C[So Black tries to salvage the situation with the atari from another direction.]
;W[ho]C[So I naturally extend to save my cutting stone.]
;B[hp]C[Black extends again.]
;W[io]C[So I go ahead and extend once again in anticipation of a fight.]
;B[ip]C[Black extends once again.]
;W[jp]TR[fo][ep][fp][gp][hp][ip][fq]C[I decided to hane to keep Black's liberties to a minimum and see how Black wants to handle this situation. And in case those don't see what I'm aiming at, notice that how the J4 group (triangle) only has three liberties.]
;B[jo]C[Black cuts as expected. And believe it or not, there is only one move for White to play to stay in the fight.]
;W[in]LB[jn:A]TR[jo]SQ[jp][kq]C[Yup. Though many might exclaim in horror at the sight of the empty triangle, a move like A (K6) would only strengthen Black's K5 stone (triangle) which would only hurt the K4 stones (square) as a result. And when you're in a fight, it's important not to strengthen your opponent unnecessarily.]
;B[jn]C[This extension is probably obvious to some of you, but this was within my calculations as well.]
;W[im]C[Another extension here might look like White is just running wildly, but you should notice that the G6 stones (triangle) as getting weaker and could potential get swallowed in White huge impending moyo. So this is not in vain.]
;B[kl]TR[im][in][go][ho][io]C[Black decides to try and keep pressure on the J6 stones (triangle) while trying to establish a moyo on the right. However, Black is overlooking an important detail.]
;W[iq]TR[fo][ep][fp][gp][hp][ip][fq][er]C[White connection here kills the entire H4 group (triangle).]
;B[fr]LB[gr:A]C[Black connects in anticipation of a possible capturing race. And while White can easily end the dispute with a move like A (G2), there is a better way of dealing with the situation.]
;W[ko]LB[km:A]C[Since White still has an opportunity to gain more liberties, why not go ahead and do so? And if you notice, this also threatens the net of A (L7).]
;B[nf]TR[od][pd]C[Black continues on his mission to try and build a moyo on the right side while putting pressure on my Q16 stones (triangle).]
;W[md]C[And while some might panic and try to immediately invade the right side, notice that Black is still missing an extension on the right side to even give the moyo any foundation. In addition, White is in no rush to destroy Black's moyo since White's moyo is larger.

]
;B[gk]C[Black probably realizes this at this point and tries to help out his weak group here.]
;W[el]LB[ik:A]C[I originally debated the splitting move of A (J9), but felt it would give Black a chance to invade and possibly make life on the left side. So instead of taking that risk, I chose this one-point jump that not only put pressure on Black; but also helped me secure 5th line territory. Not too shabby if you ask me.]
;B[lp]C[To my surprise, Black switches directions and peeps at my tiger's mouth.]
;W[kp]C[So I connected since I wanted to maintain my foothold into Black's framework here.]
;B[jr]C[Black then jumps and destroys my eye here.]
;W[kr]C[But I calmly descend since I know that in a capturing race, I would have no issues winning since I sill have opportunities to escape into the center and gain more liberties.]
;B[mn]C[Black now seals me off from his moyo with this knight's move.]
;W[km]C[So I go ahead and capture the K5 stones (triangle) to fully secure my stones, which will give me the freedom to invade and start shenanigans on the right.]
;B[kn]C[Black tries to escape.]
;W[ln]C[But White has just enough liberties to make the net work.]
;B[lm]C[Black then plays the double atari.]
;W[jm]LB[ll:A][mm:B]C[So I capture while looking at the cutting points of A (M8) and B (N7).]
;B[ll]LB[ik:A]TR[gk][gm][gn]C[Black repairs his cutting point as expected. 

At this point, I'm debating between playint A (J9) and attacking the G6 stones (triangle) or breaking up Black's right side. The only issue I had, however, was that I did not have an easy way to invade Black's right side since there was no point that would allow me a miai of two-space extensions.]
;W[qf]LB[qj:A][qk:B][qn:C][ro:D][qq:E]C[After checking out various options like A (R10), B (R9), C (R6), D (S5), and E (R3), I came up with this attach move as a way to break into Black's right side. And for those who have no idea how this attachment works, play close attention since this is more advanced technique for invading/reducing.]
;B[qe]LB[qg:A]C[While Black technically could have simply blocked at A (R13), this cut is what I calculated that Black would play.]
;W[pg]LB[of:B][qg:A]TR[qf]C[One of the keys to succeeding with the attachment technique is to treat all the stones very lightly and play flexible shapes. This hane here is an example of the since it gives no regard to the R14 stone (triangle) which would easily be captured with A (R13). And to be honest, if Black plays A (R13), then White will cut through at B (P14).]
;B[of]C[Black sees this and connects, but this is within my calculations as well.]
;W[qj]LB[qg:B][qm:A]C[With the exchanges just played, this extension here is much more powerful since White now has a miai of A (R7) and B (R13) for a base. Pretty neat right? ]
;B[qh]TR[qf][pg]C[Black decides to go for the R14 stones (triangle).]
;W[qm]C[So naturally White extends two spaces here. And while it is a bit cramped here, White should have no problems making life or escaping.]
;B[pk]C[Black move here threatens to cut White into two groups.]
;W[qk]C[So White extends to connect.]
;B[pj]LB[pm:A]TR[qf][pg]C[Black then decides to deviate from the normal attachment at A (Q7). This is probably because due to the looming aji of the Q13 stones (triangle).]
;W[pl]C[So naturally I take the shape point in order to start make living shape.]
;B[qg]C[Black practically squashes any remaining aji here (though it's worth noting there is still a little aji left).]
;W[ro]C[With this group still being susceptible to attack, I attached here to try and widen my base.]
;B[rp]C[Black hane'd on the inside to protect his corner.]
;W[rn]C[So I drew back and knew that I was practically alive at this point.]
;B[hc]C[Since Black had lost his right side, he invades on the top to try and gain compensation.

Question: If you were White, how would you respond to this invasion?]
;W[he]LB[jc:A][pc:B]TR[gk][gm][gn]C[Some may have considered a move like A (K17), but I will point out that White's top is actually not very big since Black's group at B (Q17) undercuts the entire area (which means the top is actually still quite a few moves away from being White's). In addition, Black still has the weak group of G6 (triangle) to potentially attack/kill. So I felt the cap here was the most appropriate move.]
;B[jc]C[Black attaches to start making a base as expected.]
;W[kd]C[Since I have no intentions of killing Black, the calm extension here is solid and keeps my stones connected.]
;B[lc]TR[md][od][pd]C[While Black's jump here ends up being an overplay, the aim of this move seemed to be to cut off the N16 stones (triangle) and gain a large corner.]
;W[kc]C[I felt there was no reason not to cut, so I pushed through to separate Black.]
;B[ld]C[Black cut here is the first sign of his plan. ]
;W[le]C[With my block here, it looks like things are getting a bit complicated; but keep in mind that complicating things is the only way that Black will be able to reverse the game at this point.]
;B[me]C[Black cuts.]
;W[mc]TR[lc][ld]C[But based on my reading, I should be able to capture the M17 stones (triangle).]
;B[lb]LB[kb:A][mb:B]C[Black extends. Now the question is: Which direction to block from: (A (L18) or B (N18)? Click either to see the result.]
(;W[mb]C[In the game, I decided to block from this direction since I thought it would result in a sure capture without a need for a capturing race, but I was ended up being wrong about this.]
;B[kb]C[Black turns as expected.]
;W[jb]C[So I cut.]
;B[ke]C[But Black's cut here made my heart sink as I realized I was about to be proven wrong.]
;W[lf]C[I had to extend to save my cutting stone.]
;B[id]LB[ic:A]C[And now Black has this awesome hane that works as a tesuji because it prevents White from simply capturing at A (J17). If you can't see it though, click A (J17) and see what I'm talking about.]
(;W[je]C[So I had to run.]
;B[ib]C[But as you'll notice now, Black has a chance at making a ko. Gah!!]
;W[ja]LB[ja:A]C[I descend instead of taking the ko immediately because Black would then get the ko threat of A (K19).]
;B[ia]C[Black then puts my stones in atari which forces me to start the ko.]
;W[ic]C[So I oblige and make the first capture.]
;B[ds]C[Black decides to play here to threaten to make life, but based on my life and death skills, I did not see a way for Black to live.]
;W[jc]C[So I ended the ko and awaited Black's follow-up move.]
;B[cr]LB[cq:A]C[The hane here was expected, but the response to the hane is important. Would you play at A (C3)? If so, click A (C3) to see what would happen.]
(;W[bq]C[This is the simplest and strong response White has.]
;B[cq]C[Black pushes.]
;W[cp]C[White simply turns.]
;B[br]LB[bp:A]C[Black tries to expand his eye space while threatening A (B4).]
;W[bp]C[White has no choice but to connect to keep Black weak.]
;B[ar]LB[as:A]C[Black extends and now has one eye at A (A1).]
;W[gr]C[But when White hanes here, it should be quite clear that Black has no chance at making a second eye. And thus with this, Black resigns.])
(;W[cq]LB[br:A]C[So you push here thinking Black will play A (B2) right?]
;B[bq]LB[bp:A][br:B]C[Nope. Black will (or should) double hane here.

Choose either A (B4) or B (B2).

And note that while Black should die in either variation, this is much more complicated than the in-game variation and presents numerous opportunities for mistakes.]
(;W[br]C[And while you can cut.]
;B[bs]C[Black can try to start a ko to gain something now.])
(;W[bp]C[This looks pretty calm right?]
;B[ar]C[Black will threaten to make life.]
;W[bs]C[You'll have no choice but to poke out the eye, ]
;B[cs]LB[do:A][gr:B]C[Black will connect. 

Choose A (D5) or B (G2).]
(;W[do]C[Protecting your cutting point is the option if you want to kill Black.]
;B[hr]C[Black will probably attach here.]
;W[ir]C[White's strongest move should be here.]
;B[gq]C[Black will then threaten to make a second eye, but now to kill Black, the next move is important.]
;W[es]C[You have to throw-in now.]
;B[fs]C[Black can capture.]
;W[hs]C[But now you can falsify Black's eye and there is no ko. Complicated variation no?])
(;W[gr]C[So you want to try and keep Black's eye space to a minimum right? ]
;B[do]C[What about this atari?]
;W[cp]C[White has to connect.]
;B[dn]LB[em:A]TR[en][fn][eo]C[Black can now stand up and threaten to capture the E5 stones (triangle) with A (E7).]
;W[dm]C[So most likely White will play here.]
;B[bo]C[But with this clamp, White is captured. Epic failure for White.]))))
(;W[ic]C[White captures.]
;B[je]C[But then Black will atari.]
;W[jc]C[White has to connect.]
;B[ib]C[And with this atari, it should be pretty clear that White is a goner.]))
(;W[kb]C[So this was the original sequence I read out and is actually the correct answer.]
;B[mb]C[Black turns.]
;W[nb]C[White hanes.]
;B[nc]C[And even though Black can try to atari here.]
;W[nd]C[White will connect.]
;B[ob]C[And the trickiest move is Black's hane here.]
;W[na]C[But when White descends, there is no ko potential.]
;B[oa]C[Black can try to atari here.]
;W[oc]C[White will capture and has plenty of liberties to win the capturing race.]))
(;B[ho]C[So you want to capture the cutting stone eh?]
;W[gp]C[White will run.]
;B[hp]C[You can try to atari again.]
;W[gq]TR[fo][ep][fp][fq][er]C[But now White will simply connect and capture the F3 stones (triangle). Huge loss for Black.]))
(;B[fq]C[I was expecting Black to approach here first.]
;W[dn]C[I would respond high to keep my sanrensei formation working at maximum efficiency.]
;B[jp]C[And then Black would take the big point on the bottom for his own moyo formation.]))
