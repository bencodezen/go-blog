;B[pd]BL[1786.227]C[I start with the unbiased star point opening.]
;W[dc]WL[1793.334]C[White chose the 3-4 komoku with the strong side facing my star point.]
;B[pp]BL[1779.47]C[I decided to mix it up a bit this game and start with ninrensei (i.e. double star point).]
;W[dq]WL[1789.867]LB[pj:A]C[White chooses another 3-4 komoku to face my star point. This is a nice opening for White as it is a good counter fuseki if Black chooses to create the sanrensei with A (Q10).]
;B[de]BL[1765.711]C[I studied and used sanrensei for quite some time in the past. Over time, I just found that it was relatively easy to counter if you knew what you were doing (and not to mention it's not really seen in professional play anymore). So I wanted to approach and see what White's intentions were.]
;W[dh]WL[1783.997]C[White decides to play the two space high pincer. This told me that White wasn't interested in a calm territorial game just yet.]
;B[gd]BL[1704.535]C[So I decide to follow joseki since I don't know much else at this point.]
;W[ee]WL[1764.708]C[White attaches and threatens to separate the black stones.]
;B[ef]BL[1697.504]LB[ee:1][dh:2]C[Black hanes on the outside to separate the white stones.]
;W[fe]WL[1763.42]LB[gd:2][ef:1]C[White extends to keep Black separated.]
;B[dd]BL[1692.399]LB[cc:A][ed:B]C[Black extends here to either establish a base with a move like A (C17) or separate White's stones with a move like B (E16). ]
;W[ed]WL[1756.665]LB[ec:A][fc:B]C[This move was odd to me at the time. The normal moves are either A (E17) or B (F17). However, after looking this up on Josekipedia, this is an old pattern that is not as commonly seen today.]
;B[cc]BL[1683.963]C[So I hane to establish a base.]
;W[cb]WL[1753.903]C[White's double hane here looks aggressive, but it is in fact a trick play that leads to complicated variations. For players who are unfamiliar with this joseki, don't worry about this trick play and focus on understanding the rest of the game.]
;B[ec]BL[1672.652]C[Because I'm not too familiar with the joseki myself, I will just state that the atari here is the beginning of the refutation to the trick play.]
;W[db]WL[1751.408]C[White must connect to save his connecting stone.]
;B[fc]BL[1666.457]LB[pd:B][dg:A]C[I can't say for sure this is the best move to make now. The other option is A (D13), but my goal was to not let White get an advantage on the top (which would hurt the potential of my B (Q16) stone.]
;W[df]WL[1727.182]C[White cuts now.]
;B[cf]BL[1658.587]C[Black ataris from the bottom to keep this stones connect and try to maintain the fight.]
;W[cd]WL[1640.654]LB[dg:A]C[White's cut here seems a little premature. I think White should have extended to A (D13).]
;B[ce]BL[1618.582]C[Since White cut though, I connected in order to get stronger shape.]
;W[bc]WL[1624.113]C[White decided to take the corner.]
;B[dg]BL[1615.813]TR[ed][ee][fe]C[So I made the clean capture here and weaken the E16 stones (triangle).]
;W[ic]WL[1601.555]TR[ec][fc][gd]C[White tries to aggressively pincer my F17 stones (triangle).]
;B[hf]BL[1582.317]TR[ed][ee][fe]C[To prevent myself from getting chased on the board, I played this knight's move as a net to the E15 stones (triangle).]
;W[nq]WL[1521.749]C[White approaches from the bottom.]
;B[lq]BL[1563.478]C[And I decide on the one space pincer since I have no intention of letting White get any framework possibility on the bottom.]
;W[pn]WL[1488.355]C[White uses the double approach tactic.]
;B[np]BL[1529.193]C[And I am happy to continue attacking this stone since I never had any real intentions of building the right side anyhow.]
;W[mp]WL[1485.785]C[White hanes for aji potentail later on.]
;B[mq]BL[1524.841]C[I cut to keep the stones separated.]
;W[qp]WL[1467.256]C[White then attaches here to see what Black's intentions are.]
;B[oq]BL[1517.573]C[And I decide on a calm move here to take profit and hopefully end in sente.]
;W[qq]WL[1464.957]C[White extends to take the corner and I got sente as I hoped.]
;B[kc]BL[1496.412]C[Since White neglected his pincer stone here, I chose to pincer him as aggressively as possible. ]
;W[qf]WL[1452.728]C[However, White's stone is still rather light, so White makes the good decision to ignore my attack for now and approach my upper right corner (while giving himself potential to build the right side).]
;B[nd]BL[1489.625]LB[kc:A]C[Since I had a bit of top territory potential, I chose the one space high jump since is worked well with my A (L17) stone.]
;W[pj]WL[1447.521]C[As I expected, White builds the right side. However, It was still rather thin, so I wasn't terribly worrried.]
;B[og]BL[1422.288]TR[nd][pd][og]C[I decided to go ahead and make the horse's face shape (triangle) to reduce his moyo potential while simultaneously growing my top.]
;W[ph]WL[1436.31]C[White protects his territory.]
;B[do]BL[1370.133]C[And then I embark to see what White's intentoins were for the lower left corner.]
;W[nr]WL[1426.656]C[White's descent here is a small overplay, but I think the purpose was to give himself a potential to exploit aji later on.]
;B[or]BL[1344.362]TR[nq][nr]C[Black must descend to keep the O2 stones (triangle) captured.]
;W[no]WL[1424.702]C[White ataris now to give Black bad shape.]
;B[op]BL[1342.244]C[And Black has no choice but to connect.]
;W[dm]WL[1419.661]C[White chooses the one-space high pincer.]
;B[fo]BL[1323.286]C[I choose this simple one-point jump to split the White stones and see how White responds.]
;W[fq]WL[1416.583]C[And according to my prediction, White takes profit and a base on the bottom.]
;B[cq]BL[1316.94]C[So I go ahead and make this attachment as a brief exchange for my real goal.]
;W[cr]WL[1409.571]C[White hanes in response.]
;B[dj]BL[1305.184]C[And now I can split the stones on the left and have pretty good potential on the board now.]
;W[dk]WL[1378.388]TR[do][fo][cq]C[White attaches to try and gains some strength to hopefully counter attack the D5 stones (triangle).]
;B[ek]BL[1271.665]C[I thought the hane would be the most aggressive response.]
;W[ej]WL[1363.82]C[White crosscuts to create complications and try to gain eye shape in an area where Black is strong.]
;B[cj]BL[1256.416]C[I extends to keep both groups firmly separated.]
;W[el]WL[1358.121]C[White ataris.]
;B[fk]BL[1253.066]C[I extend to keep White separated.]
;W[fj]WL[1350.435]TR[dh][ej][fj]C[White extends to try and strengthens his E10 group (triangle).]
;B[gk]BL[1245.175]C[I extend to keep my group strong and prevent White from "hane at the end of two stones."]
;W[eh]WL[1348.041]C[White tries to keep his group connected, but there is little chance for it to live.]
;B[ck]BL[1234.348]TR[dk]C[So I calmly extend here while putting the D9 stone (triangle) in atari.]
;W[gm]WL[1332.13]TR[do][fo][cq]C[White jumps out and now the D5 group (triangle) is starting to get weaker.]
;B[cp]BL[1211.586]C[So I extend to keep them strong and connected.]
;W[dl]WL[1323.685]C[White connects but this is in bad shape.]
;B[gj]BL[1195.33]TR[dh][eh][ej][fj]C[I turn here to keep the E10 group (triangle) from becoming anything dangerous.]
;W[gh]WL[1317.236]C[White tries to make shape.]
;B[hh]BL[1177.043]C[But all I have to do is keep them sealed and they will die.]
;W[ch]WL[1307.866]TR[cj][dj][ck]C[White descents to and now my C10 group (triangle) is cut off.]
;B[fg]BL[1131.964]TR[dd][ce][de][cf][ef][dg]C[I peep at White's shape while strengthening my D16 group (triangle).]
;W[fh]WL[1293.575]C[White connects.]
;B[bi]BL[1091.655]C[I play the diagonal here to threaten to connect to my stones.]
;W[bg]WL[1278.959]C[White keeps my stones separated while trying to connect back to his own group.]
;B[gg]BL[1032.542]LB[eg:A]C[I see a weakness in the A (D13) connection and decide to extend here, but this may have been a bit too passive.]
;W[bl]WL[1235.475]TR[bi][cj][dj][ck]C[White now tries to kill off my C10 group (triangle).]
;B[cl]BL[1019.257]C[So I try and fight back.]
;W[cm]WL[1227.061]C[White blocks.]
;B[bk]BL[1017.167]LB[bm:A]C[I descend and threaten A (B7).]
;W[be]WL[1209.059]C[White decides to connects his group.]
;B[bm]BL[1005.617]TR[dk][dl][el][cm][dm][gm]C[So I take the capture here and aim at the D7 stones (triangle) now.]
;W[bn]WL[1199.185]C[White counter ataris.]
;B[al]BL[1002.282]C[I capture and my group is now alive.]
;W[cn]WL[1192.005]TR[do][fo][cp][cq]C[White connects and now my C3 group (triangle) is weak.]
;B[br]BL[999.631]C[So I hane to get a base.]
;W[go]WL[1168.829]LB[dr:A]C[I'm surprised that White doesn't connect at A (D2), but it seems he is trying to link his groups together with this move.]
;B[fn]BL[982.957]LB[fl:A][fm:B]C[His shape is a little thin though, so I go ahead and separate the groups. This threatens the cut at A (F8) or B (F7).]
;W[fm]WL[1153.138]C[White connects.]
;B[gn]BL[979.455]C[So now I can push through and cut the groups apart.]
;W[hm]WL[1151.289]C[White extends.]
;B[hn]BL[972.146]TR[go][dq][fq][cr]C[I also extend to keep pressure while weakening the F3 stones (triangle).]
;W[im]WL[1147.482]C[Since White is now in the open, I didn't think I'd be able to really profit off of any attack at the moment.]
;B[dr]BL[943.311]C[so I decided to attack the bottom group and see what White would do.]
;W[er]WL[1128.266]C[White counter ataris.]
;B[cs]BL[939.359]C[I capture and now my group is fully alive.]
;W[lp]WL[1119.004]TR[go][dq][fq][er]C[White then extends here which I thought was odd since the F3 group (triangle) was still not yet alive.]
;B[kq]BL[933.002]C[Oh well, I was happy to extend and gain more territory.]
;W[kp]WL[1116.369]C[White extends again.]
;B[jp]BL[910.238]LB[jq:A]C[When I hane here, I read out that the A (K3) cut didn't really work. Otherwise though, I would have just extended at A (K3) instead.]
;W[jq]WL[1113.722]C[White tries to cut anyways.]
;B[mo]BL[905.91]LB[ko:A]C[But since I'm ahead on the liberty race, I was able to get this cut in first which threatens the atari at A (L5).]
;W[mn]WL[1101.641]C[White tries to capture my stone.]
;B[lo]BL[810.983]C[But the ladder does not work in his favor.]
;W[ko]WL[1097.978]C[White extends.]
;B[ln]BL[809.316]C[I run.]
;W[kn]WL[1092.76]C[And then White extends again because he knows the ladder was not in his favor.]
;B[lm]BL[803.679]C[I extend once more and now I'm safe in the center.]
;W[kr]WL[1089.737]TR[kq][lq][mq]TB[df][bl][cr]C[White tries to counter attark my M3 stones (triangle).]
;B[iq]BL[775.902]C[But I have this forcing move first.]
;W[jr]WL[1071.192]C[White connects.]
;B[mr]BL[771.104]C[And now I can capture safely.]
;W[km]WL[1069.317]C[White extends here, but at this point, I'm noticing that the bottom is completely open to me completely owning it.]
;B[ip]BL[708.964]C[So I connect solidly and have no secured the entire bottom for myself.]
;W[ll]WL[1052.194]C[White tries to go after my four stones.]
;B[qo]BL[656.043]C[But I didn't think they were worth much at this point and would only hurt me since they would become heavy as I tried to run away into White's influence. So I hane here to try and break into the right side.]
;W[qn]WL[1038.436]C[White descends to try and protect the right side.]
;B[po]BL[640.192]C[I connect solidly.]
;W[ro]WL[1020.34]C[And then White tries to block.]
;B[rn]BL[634.03]C[Except I have this double cut! ]
(;W[rp]WL[1015.88]LB[rm:A]C[White protects the corner, but if you think he should have atari'd at A (S7), go back to Move 117 to see why it doesn't work.]
;B[on]BL[623.077]LB[mm:A][rm:B]C[So now I can do this hane which threatens to run out my four stones with A (N7). If you can't see what I mean, click on B (S7) to see the variation.]
(;W[mm]WL[1007.739]C[White sees this and makes a clean capture.]
;B[rm]BL[609.17]LB[pm:A]C[I extend to threaten the capture at A (Q7).]
;W[ql]WL[1002.262]C[White jumps to prevent Black from capturing the stones.]
;B[qm]BL[599.892]C[But I was ready for that and had this sequence in mind.]
;W[pm]WL[997.206]C[White must run to prevent capture.]
;B[pl]BL[598.709]C[Now I can cut.]
;W[om]WL[995.413]C[White must run again.]
;B[ol]BL[593.74]C[And I get one more forcing move here.]
;W[nm]WL[992.136]C[White must connect in bad shape.]
;B[qk]BL[592.025]TR[qf][ph][pj]C[And now I can come back and secure some eye shape for my gorup. In addition, the R14 group (triangle) is now quite weak.]
;W[pr]WL[986.284]C[White still has to take care of his corner though.]
;B[rr]BL[581.886]C[And so I go ahead and play on the vital point knowing that White was unlikely to die, but my goal was to force White to live in gote.]
;W[qr]WL[958.753]C[When White connects here, I thought about trying to kill the corner.]
;B[ir]BL[540.538]C[But I decided that securing the bottom and avoiding any sort of capturing race would be best.]
;W[rs]WL[955.129]C[So White lives in gote.]
;B[ri]BL[494.042]TR[qf][ph][pj]C[And now I can remove the base of the R14 stones (triangle).]
;W[qc]WL[937.683]C[White invades the 3-3.]
;B[pc]BL[481.744]LB[qd:A]C[So I go ahead and block here since I had the most potential for the top. But in hindsight, I think that A (R16) would have been interesting as well since it would keep White separated in two groups.]
;W[qd]WL[934.714]C[White establishes a base.]
;B[pe]BL[480.541]C[And I go ahead and take the sape point while further expanding my top potential.]
;W[qb]WL[931.026]C[White descends.]
;B[pb]BL[475.357]C[This block actually seems a bit small now, but I felt I was ahead and felt no need to play anything riskier.]
;W[kd]WL[924.763]C[When White attaches here, I'll have to admit that I did not think White would live. I was quite confident I could kill White.]
;B[jd]BL[464.052]C[So I hane to keep White separated.]
;W[jc]WL[921.393]C[White cuts.]
;B[lc]BL[457.628]C[I calmly extend to keep White separated and minimize any aji.]
;W[hb]WL[897.98]C[White threatens to connect to his D18 group.]
;B[gb]BL[449.386]C[So I kosumi here to keep White's eye space to a minimum.]
;W[je]WL[895.012]C[White puts my cutting stone in atari.]
;B[kf]BL[418.553]LB[ie:A][ke:B]C[But White did not have a chance of making an eye since I could falsify it with A (J15) or B (L15) at any time, so I ignored him to surround his group.]
;W[jf]WL[862.707]C[White extends to try and break out.]
;B[kg]BL[374.075]C[I extend to strengthen my stone while keeping him sealed in.]
;W[jg]WL[842.304]C[White extends again.]
;B[jh]BL[352.637]C[And then I decide to hane since it would keep White sealed in.]
;W[ld]WL[839.781]C[Or maybe not?]
;B[mc]BL[314.473]LB[ig:A]C[I think this move might have been a mistake. Playing at A (J13) would probably have been more than adequate.]
;W[kh]WL[817.404]C[Now White has this cut.]
;B[mf]BL[223.102]C[So I have to jump to save my L14 stones.]
;W[ih]WL[812.683]C[And White can atari now.]
;B[ji]BL[220.19]C[I extend.]
;W[hi]WL[810.678]LB[ig:A]C[White ataris and I see the potential for me to make a ko at A (J13).]
;B[hg]BL[213.152]C[But I chicken out and think I can win the capturing race. This is my losing move.]
;W[ig]WL[792.202]C[White connects.]
;B[ii]BL[207.235]C[I cut and think I'm doing just fine.]
;W[ki]WL[788.827]C[And then White's descent here tells me differently.]
;B[kj]BL[194.565]C[I try to hane to gain more liberties.]
;W[lj]WL[786.222]C[White keeps right up with me.]
;B[kk]BL[143.697]C[So I extend to try and come up with something.]
;W[hd]WL[677.201]C[White now tries to make some eye space.]
;B[he]BL[552.573]TR[gb][ec][fc][gd]C[And I respond because it threatens to cut off the G18 stones (triangle).]
;W[hj]WL[658.397]LB[jj:A]C[And with this descent, I'm in real trouble now. White threatens A (K10).]
;B[jj]BL[523.338]C[So I connect in bad shape to reduce the number of forcing moves for White.]
;W[lk]WL[649.984]C[And then when White connects here, the hunt is pretty much over.]
;B[hk]BL[483.689]C[I extend her to try and maximize my liberties for a cpaturing race.]
;W[gi]WL[641.546]C[White connects.]
;B[li]BL[473.894]C[And now I try to make something happen.]
;W[lh]WL[639.151]C[White runs.]
;B[mi]BL[466.987]C[I extend.]
;W[mh]WL[636.188]C[White extends again.]
;B[ik]BL[458.155]C[And now I connect my groups to try and start a capturing race that I am woefully behind in.]
;W[kb]WL[517.843]C[White ignores me to play here.]
;B[ni]BL[428.832]C[And I pounce on the opportunity to capture the N12 (triangle) stones.]
;W[nh]WL[489.886]C[White tries to extend.]
;B[oh]BL[424.588]C[So I cut.]
;W[oi]WL[486.399]C[White counter cuts. And then I make another mistake which costs me my chance to bring the game back in my favor. 

Question: What's the correct response in this position?]
(;B[oj]BL[421.474]C[I thought this would be in good shape, but you'll see shortly it actually doesn't work. Go back to Move 184 and click on O10 to see the correct sequence.]
