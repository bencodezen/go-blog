;B[pd]BL[1797.246]C[Star point opening.]
;W[dc]WL[1792.181]C[One of the things I dislike playing against right now is sanrensei. So when Black has the star point, I often play the 3-4 in preparation of the counter fuseki to sanrensei.]
;B[pp]BL[1794.607]C[Black sets up double ninrensei.]
;W[dq]WL[1789.368]C[With this 3-4, the counter to the sanrensei is set up.]
;B[do]BL[1785.413]LB[dl:C][cm:B][co:A][fp:D]C[When Black approaches here, I have four options that I am more of less comfortable choosing. ]
;W[nc]WL[1765.199]C[Since I don't want to decide a direction just yet, I approach Black's upper right corner to get a sense of what Black is trying to do.]
;B[pf]BL[1772.639]LB[qh:A]C[The one space jump here shows an interest in influence, but leaves a weakness at A (R12) later on.]
;W[jd]WL[1656.762]C[So I go ahead and set up moyo-like formation on the top.]
;B[qj]BL[1761.06]C[This move surprised me a bit since it's a little slow, but it's clear that Black is interested in the right side.]
;W[nq]WL[1609.479]C[So I decide to approach again to probe Black's intentions.]
;B[kp]BL[1747.282]C[I don't encounter the two space high pincer much.]
;W[qq]WL[1457.055]C[So I decided to go ahead and take the corner to settle so I could turn my attention to other parts of the board.]
;B[qp]BL[1705.667]C[Black blocks the correct direction.]
;W[pq]WL[1451.233]C[I extend to settle my group.]
;B[op]BL[1702.825]C[Black extends and takes the shape point.]
;W[nr]WL[1446.641]C[And then I settle my group with strong shape to prevent minimal harrassing later on.]
;B[np]BL[1698.407]C[Black extends to press down and seal White in.]
;W[oj]WL[1437.988]C[The right side is getting pretty big at this point, so I decide to cap and prevent Black from getting the ideal one point jump.]
;B[pi]BL[1685.786]C[The normal convention is to "play knight's move when capped," but Black plays this weird diagonal. ]
;W[ne]WL[1377.784]C[Since I didn't know quite yet what to do, I decided to jump here to start developing my top a bit.]
;B[de]BL[1676.442]C[Black's approach to my corner was only natural since White getting this move would be very big in terms of top development potential.]
;W[fd]WL[1346.97]C[The knight's move was an easy choice for me since I knew that it was more or less a one way street in terms of helping build the top framework.]
(;B[ch]BL[1669.179]LB[cc:A]C[When I saw this, I was like (o.O) because the normal move is A (C17) and I had never seen this before. It just looks weird to me. 

To see the normal joseki, go back to Move 22 and click on A (C17).]
;W[cd]WL[1309.941]C[Since Black normally gets to take away White's corner in the normal joseki, the diagonal here is an excellent way to punish Black's odd move since it is very solid and gains White a lot of points in the corner while threatening to undermine Black's base.]
;B[ce]BL[1662.846]C[With Black defending his base, this result is UBER good for White because (1) White got to develop the top, (2) White got corner territory (roughly 10 points by my estimation), (3) Black is overconcentrated since he would ideally like a 3 space extension from his 2 stone wall, and (4) Black's group is still not completely settled and can be attacked later on. ]
;W[co]WL[1306.961]C[Now that the board was more settled, I decided on the attach joseki for the bottom left corner.]
;B[cn]BL[1657.805]C[Black hanes to block White from getting into the left side.]
;W[cp]WL[1300.479]C[I extend to keep my stones connected.]
;B[dn]BL[1655.552]C[Black connects.]
;W[fq]WL[1298.925]C[And then the one space jump is joseki in order to settle the corner territory in good shape.]
;B[oc]BL[1646.561]C[The normal joseki has Black extending at A (C10) or B (D10), but as you can imagine, Black would be overconcentrated if he does. So it was no surprise to me when Black decided to tenuki. 

With this kick, Black declared his intentions to keep the corner.]
;W[nb]WL[1295.866]LB[qc:A]C[I descended once to protect my top side while simultaneously threatening a 3-3 invasion at A (R17).]
;B[ob]BL[1644.035]C[Black blocks, but now I can take sente to play on a bigger part of the board.]
;W[ng]WL[1234.192]C[I decide to jump again since this area is a mutual point of growth for both players. If Black were to get this point, his left moyo would begin to look extremely impressive.]
;B[oi]BL[1634.94]C[Black pushes to try and solidify his left territory.]
;W[ni]WL[1220.119]TR[oj]C[But I had no intention of trying to save the O10 stone (triangle). The hane here treats the O10 stone (triangle) lightly and continues to build White's top moyo.]
;B[nj]BL[1628.865]C[Black cuts as expected.]
;W[mi]WL[1197.697]LB[mj:A]C[Though I had the choice to atari at A (N10), I didn't want ot strengthen Black just yet since his left side was quite big and I believed I still had a chance to reduce/invade later on.]
;B[mj]BL[1620.052]C[Black extends to continue building the left side.]
;W[lj]WL[1193.067]C[But I was happy to hane at the head of his stones again since this would leave a defect in his shape that I could possibly use later on.]
;B[ml]BL[1611.651]C[Black jumps to prevent the ladder.]
;W[lk]WL[1174.565]C[I extend solidly to take away the shape point from Black and start creating aji in this area.]
;B[ll]BL[1582.662]C[Black blocks.]
;W[ff]WL[1158.03]LB[li:A]C[And though the cutting point at A (M11) remains, I felt that this one point jump was huge in terms of territory and also hit another mutual point of growth for both players.]
;B[li]BL[1577.648]C[Black tried to punish my tenuki with this cut, but it's a bit of an overplay. You'll see why soon.]
;W[jk]WL[1086.674]LB[lh:B][ki:A]C[Though the atari of A (L11) or B (M12) would be the first reaction that most players would have, I felt that would unnecessarily strengthen Black. And since I wanted to capture / severely attack the group, surrounding it seemed to be the best way to start.]
;B[lh]BL[1570.21]LB[nh:A]C[Black extends and threatens the atari at A (O12).]
;W[mg]WL[1081.591]C[Bamboo joint to solidify my connections.]
;B[jh]BL[1565.911]C[Black starts running.]
;W[hi]WL[1027.157]C[And I decide to test the diagonal jumpin order to continue my attack on the group.]
;B[ii]BL[1557.631]C[Black tries to escape. The question remains: how to block?]
;W[ij]WL[1012.232]LB[hj:A]C[Out of instinct I hane'd, but this exposes a lot of cutting points for Black to exploit. A (G10) would be better since it is much stronger as a formation.]
;B[hh]BL[1552.762]C[With Black's hane here, White's thin shape is becoming more apparent.]
;W[gi]WL[1005.115]C[I extend to prevent Black from getting an atari.]
;B[gh]BL[1549.916]C[Black extends once more.]
;W[fh]WL[990.525]C[And I hane to try and block.]
;B[jj]BL[1544.682]C[Black now gets the double tiger mouth and has quite a bit of eye potential. Granted, later on I was shown that Black is still very weak and could die, but it does look pretty promising for Black.]
;W[hk]WL[974.201]LB[kj:A]C[I thought I would defend with the double tiger's mouth, but this is too passive. Even though it would form an empty triangle, A (L10) is the better move since it removes one eye and keeps all of White's stones connected.]
;B[kj]BL[1537.961]C[Now Black makes great shape in sente because White has to connect.]
;W[kk]WL[968.103]C[As I connected, I realized my mistake and could only sight as Black was about to make easy life in an area where I most likely should have been able to kill him (or make him barely escape with his life).]
;B[ig]BL[1489.606]C[Black starts to make living shape.]
;W[jf]WL[934.658]LB[kg:A]C[I debated A (L13) as well, but decided to play here to threaten to falsify Black's eye and try to contain Black from reducing the top side too much.]
;B[gg]BL[1470.042]C[Black makes ugly shape but clearly intends on pushing at A (F13).]
(;W[hf]WL[902.258]C[I tried to get fancy, but clearly I am a moron because as the saying goes, "Even a moron connects against the peep." Damn me and my kyu "creativity!" Though in my defense, I thought I was sealing in the top, but A (F13) would be much better. To see why, go back to Move 63 and click on F13.]
;B[fg]BL[1467.018]C[With Black pushing through now, as Justin put it so nicely, "My shape is in complete tatters." Not only am I cut apart, but now Black will get to connect his groups and is now very strong. *hangs head in shame*]
;W[eg]WL[895.577]C[I try to block, but this is a complete overplay.]
;B[eh]BL[1451.48]C[Black ataris.]
;W[fi]WL[893.695]C[I connect.]
;B[ef]BL[1447.338]TR[eg]C[Black ataris and captures my E13 stone (triangle). ]
;W[dg]WL[885.961]C[I extend thinking that I'm creating aji for later, but this is a bad move.]
;B[dh]BL[1443.719]C[Now Black's shape is solid and White is down a ko threat. *hangs head in shame*]
;W[km]WL[858.502]LB[mk:A][nl:B]C[For a lot of the game, I've been eying the aji of the push at A (N9) and cut at B (O8) in hopes of breaking into Black's right side. This was a preparatory move in hopes of doing so. 

To see what I read out, click on D9.]
(;B[ln]BL[1431.34]C[Black sees the weakness and defends.]
;W[dj]WL[789.944]TR[cn][dn][do]C[I then try to embark to attack the D5 stones (triangle) as I'm feeling behind now.]
;B[bj]BL[1416.03]LB[cl:A]C[This slide took me by surprise and I felt like Black was already connected. Although looking at it now, perhaps a move like A (C8) could have split the groups apart.]
;W[bk]WL[744.42]TR[dg][eg]C[At the time I was staring at trying to possibly use the aji of the marked stones (triangle), so I read out some delusional sequence where this attachment lets me do so. You'll see what I mean shortly.]
;B[ck]BL[1405.227]C[Black hanes as expected.]
;W[cj]WL[742.701]C[Cutting is the only natural move.]
;B[bl]BL[1402.63]TR[bk]C[This forces Black to atari the B9 stone (triangle).]
;W[bi]WL[741.174]C[So White gets this counter atari.]
;B[ak]BL[1399.856]C[Black then captures.]
;W[cg]WL[738.987]C[And then I set out to execute my plan, except there's one fatal flaw.]
(;B[bg]BL[1395.261]C[I didn't account for Black's hane here. *hangs head in shame*

To see what I had envisioned, go back to Move 82 and click on B12.]
;W[bh]WL[730.214]C[I cut here out of frustration, but this just continues to burn another ko threat and induces Black to further strengthen himself.]
;B[cf]BL[1358.328]C[Black secures his group with the atari and I'm feeling pretty bummed at this point since I'm feeling behind.]
;W[lm]WL[669.067]C[According to score estimator, the game is actually still close, but my emotion overrode my ability to come to this logical conclusion and so I embark on this push and cut to try and reduce Black's right side. 

And for all those reading this, I'm pretty sure this is a slight (if not complete) overplay. So this is not recommended to imitate. Haha.]
;B[mm]BL[1352.559]C[Black blocks.]
;W[mn]WL[667.914]LB[mk:A][lo:B]C[And then I cut looking to make use of aji around A (N9) or B (M5).]
;B[nm]BL[1286.781]C[Black defends with the very inefficient empty triangle (for which he will suffer for later as you'll see) which made me really happy.]
;W[mo]WL[650.592]LB[ko:A]C[The descent was the move natural move next since it threatened the net at A (L5) next.]
;B[mp]BL[1274.876]C[Black keeps pressure on my stones.]
;W[lo]WL[645.866]C[Atari to threaten to connect.]
;B[kn]BL[1270.35]C[Black extends.]
;W[lp]WL[630.838]C[And now I push through here because Black cannot block without losing a stone. Click on M3 if you don't believe me.]
(;B[mq]BL[1113.422]TR[nq][pq][qq][nr]C[Black sees the issue and turns instead. And for those looking to improve your ability to analyze situations, you should notice that this turn start to weaken the O2 group (triangle).]
;W[lq]WL[619.946]C[I extend once more to prevent any capturing race from occurring.]
;B[mr]BL[1093.165]LB[or:A]TR[nq][pq][qq][nr]C[Black extends once more, and now it should be very apparent that the O2 group is weak due to a move like A (P2).]
;W[rp]WL[598.407]C[So it was time to strengthen my group while hopefully reducing Black's right side in sente.]
;B[ro]BL[1084.918]C[Black blocks.]
;W[rq]WL[596.82]C[I connect and make living shape (at least I'm pretty sure, please correct me if you can read out a sequence for Black to kill this shape).]
;B[qo]BL[1081.007]C[And thank my lucky stars, Black connects so I have sente to continue trying to catch up.]
;W[on]WL[585.928]LB[kl:B][nn:A]C[In delight of getting sente, I decided to jump here because I read out the sequence if Black tries to push and cut through A (O6) (which actually doesn't work). However, that was slightly wishful thinking since Black has other forcing moves like B (L8) to render my (delusional) sequence useless.

There are too many variations to show, but at the bare minimum, if you're curious about what I had read out, click on O6.]
(;B[pm]BL[1003.966]LB[ol:A]C[Fortunately for me, Black does not see the more active way of defending against the reduction and plays the more submissive block here instead. 

And though I didn't see this, Justin pointed out a cool tesuji at A (P8) that I thought would be great to make note of. Click on A (P8) to see how the basic sequence if you're curious. (And to clarify now, it might not work in terms of overall strategy, but it is an interesting move to consider).]
(;W[fo]WL[505.714]C[Since I had succeeded in reduincg Black I set off to try and make my bottom/center territory as big as I possibly could.]
;B[kr]BL[922.089]C[This one-point jump was a great reduction move by Black, but a clear thorn in my side when I saw it.]
;W[kq]WL[496.347]C[No choice but to purhs and try to salvage what I can.]
;B[jr]BL[916.934]C[Black continues to march in and destroy White's bottom potential.]
;W[jq]WL[493.153]C[Keep Black pressed down on the second line for as long as possible.]
;B[iq]BL[914.571]C[But Black can now hane.]
;W[ip]WL[488.507]C[Have to hane as well to prevent Black from destroying more territory.]
;B[hq]BL[897.78]C[Black extends.]
;W[hp]WL[481.605]C[I follow to keep protecting my territory.]
;B[fn]BL[772.336]C[To my dismay, Black now attaches and continues to reduce my center. ]
;W[gn]WL[460.848]C[I really hate being forced to submit to my opponent's moves, but I felt I did not have a choice and hane'd to keep protecting my area.]
;B[fm]BL[756.513]C[Black stands and now starts to gain some points for himself along with keeping my center area in check.]
;W[gm]WL[430.171]C[Obligatory blocking at this point.]
;B[ge]BL[721.523]C[Black now threatens to destroy my top. Great...]
;W[gd]WL[418.032]C[Have to block if I have any chance of winning, but constantly defending was really frustrating me.]
;B[if]BL[710.99]C[HALLELUJAH! Black played a slow move that I could afford to ignore. ]
;W[oa]WL[412.3]C[Payback time!! In terms of endgame value, this move is huge since it is double sente for both sides. So though this probably doesn't exist, it's like quadruple sente! Haha.]
;B[pa]BL[708.02]C[Black blocks.]
;W[na]WL[410.605]C[I connect.]
;B[pb]BL[705.978]C[And now Black has to defend in gote. MUAHAHAHA!!!]
;W[pg]WL[403.455]C[Now you will feel my wrath!!!]
;B[qg]BL[701.989]C[Black blocks.]
;W[of]WL[400.91]LB[pe:A]C[I make shape and threaten the atari at A (Q15).]

;B[sn]BL[691.419]C[Black blocks.]

;W[om]WL[345.463]C[Now I embaruk to further reduce his right side in sente, but this nearly fails since it's actually a bit of an overplay.]
;B[ol]BL[667.009]C[Black blocks as expected.]
;W[mk]WL[308.371]LB[kl:A]C[I atari thinking I would end in sente, but this removes a liberty from my group which becomes a problem shortly. So in hindsight, A (L8) was the honte (i.e. proper) move in this position.]
;B[nk]BL[658.858]C[Black runs as expected.]
;W[nn]WL[298.377]C[And then I connect my group thinking it would be in sente.]

;B[jl]BL[572.577]TR[lj][jk][kk][lk][mk]C[Remember that liberty I burned on Move136? Now it's biting me in the butt since Black's extension now puts the M10 stones (triangle) in atari.]

;B[il]BL[563.086]LB[im:A]C[Black's extends here thinking he's reducing White's territory, but this is a mistake. The better move is forcing move of atari at A (J7).]

;W[gl]WL[272.298]C[Block to minimize the try and stay connected.]
