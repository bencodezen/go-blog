;B[qd]
;W[od]C[Lately I've been against letting my opponent's get the 1-3-5 opening, so I just immediately approach to complicate the game from the beginning.]
;B[mc]
;W[qc]
;B[rc]
;W[pc]
;B[qg]
;W[mb]C[I decided to try and use the new joseki move that I learned from Myung at the 1st Washington Baduk Open Championship, but I'll be honest in that I'm not exactly sure if I used it correctly.]
;B[nb]
;W[lc]
;B[md]
;W[rb]
;B[lb]
;W[rd]TR[qd][qg]C[I was happy to trade the corner and weaken the R16 group (triangle).]
;B[kc]
;W[ec]C[I decided on the 5-3 point in order to negate the power of Black's influence.]
;B[do]
;W[dl]
;B[go]C[Never played against this before!]
;W[gq]C[Can't let my corner get surrounded.]
;B[cq]
;W[cr]
;B[cp]
;W[er]
;B[cj]
;W[ch]
;B[ej]
;W[fl]
;B[ip]
;W[cd]
;B[eh]
;W[df]C[I felt overconcentrated here, but thought it was neccessary since I already have a weak group in the center of the board I need to take care of.]
;B[gj]
;W[eo]C[Since Black was strong, I attached to try and find some shape.]
;B[en]
;W[fn]
;B[fo]
;W[ep]
;B[fm]C[I was surprised by this atari.]
;W[dn]
;B[gn]
;W[em]LB[co:A]C[Now I could either get the ko or the capture of A (C5).]
;B[cn]
;W[fn]C[Ko it is!]
;B[re]C[When I saw this threat, I realized if I answered once, I would probably be forced to answer more times after.]
;W[gm]C[So I ended the ko because I believed I could make something work with the upper right aji. ]
;B[sd]
;W[cm]TR[cn][do][cp][cq]C[Now I wanted to take my profit on the left and squeeze the life out of the C3 group (triangle).]
;B[mq]
;W[in]C[Taking the vital shape point, thought this might be small in regards to the whole board perspective.]
;B[hr]
;W[hp]C[Though this sort of works out in my favor, this is a rather small move.]
;B[gr]
;W[iq]
;B[hq]
;W[jp]
;B[io]
;W[ho]
;B[jo]
;W[gp]
;B[jq]
;W[di]C[Time to harrass this group!]
;B[dj]
;W[ei]
;B[fi]
;W[fh]C[Time to cut and possibly get a big upper left piece of territory in exchange!]
;B[bg]C[Black tries to fight back.]
;W[bh]C[But I'm pretty sure that this fight does not end well for Black.]
;B[dh]
;W[ci]
;B[cg]
;W[dg]C[Moment of truth. Is the ladder good for Black? Or for White? 

Try and read it out!]
;B[eg]C[Black decides it's good for him. I stare at the ladder and read it again for fear that I am wrong.]
;W[fg]C["Fine," I thought, "I don't think my reading is below yours. Let's see who's right!"]
;B[ef]C[Black was very adamant that he was correct. Or perhaps he decided to gamble it all on this ladder. Either he would be right and I would be in ruins, or he would be wrong.]
;W[ee]C[Time to give chase! 

One last chance: Is the ladder good for White or Black?]
;B[ff]
;W[gf]
;B[fe]
;W[fd]
;B[ge]
;W[he]
;B[gd]
;W[gc]
;B[hd]
;W[id]
;B[hc]
;W[hb]
;B[ic]TR[kc]C[Looks like the L17 stone (triangle) is a ladder breaker!]
;W[jc]C[What will White do?]
;B[ib]
;W[jb]C[Oh wait. There's this variation that makes it work for White. And boom goes the dynamite!

Black resigns. ])
