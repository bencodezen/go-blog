;B[fe]LB[ic:A]C[Interesting response by Black to try and keep my sealed in. I think he was hoping I would try to expand my base with a move like A (J17).]
;W[ch]LB[df:A]C[Black was clearly trying to build a left moyo, and I had no intention of letting him get an easy framework. I had faith in my ability to live with my top group and knew that the aji of A (D14) was always waiting for me.]
;B[bc]
;W[ck]C[Ignoring Black here was another big accomplishment for me. I still ddin't feel terribly threatened by Black.]
;B[db]
;W[df]C[Now I use the aji to ensure that I don't die / escape into the center.]
;B[dg]
;W[ef]
;B[cg]
;W[cb]C[This block was to force Black to live with his stone while strengthening my group so it doesn't get harrassed too much later on.]

;B[bk]C[Black doesn't see it yet. Time to see who's right!]
;W[cn]LB[dn:A]
(;B[el]LB[dn:A]C[Black realizes his mistake here, but if you thought Black could block at A (D6), go back to Move 82 and click on D6.]
