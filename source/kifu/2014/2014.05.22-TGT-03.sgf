;B[do]
;W[nc]C[Similar to Seo Bong Soo, I wanted to create a complicated board as much as possible, so I tenuki'd here.]
;B[ld]C[The high one space was unexpected.]
;W[qc]LB[ne:A]C[I'm not really familiar with the one space jump at A (O15) and didn't see a  good continuation for it. So I decided to take the corner and see how Black blocks.]

;B[ob]
;W[qb]
;B[oc]
;W[qf]
;B[pf]
;W[qg]
;B[de]
;W[fd]C[I chose this direction to negate the power of Black's wall.]
;B[cc]
;W[cb]
;B[cd]
;W[eb]
;B[dh]
;W[jc]
;B[kc]
;W[jd]C[In hindsight, maybe I should have ignored it to take sente. It's too small to be protecting my top at the moment.]
;B[cq]C[Letting Black get the initiative here sucked.]
;W[cr]
;B[cp]
;W[gq]C[I try to be faster with my position.]
;B[br]
;W[jq]C[Trying not to let Black overconcentrate me.]
;B[dr]
;W[nq]
;B[lq]
;W[qn]C[With my position strong overall, I thought the double approach was good to start a fight.]
;B[pn]
;W[pm]
;B[qo]
;W[on]
;B[po]
;W[qm]LB[om:A]C[I decided to connect here since Black cutting at A (P7) would most likely result in a good fight for me.]
;B[om]C[Let the fighting commence!]
;W[nn]
;B[ol]
;W[qq]C[I invaded here to undermine Black's base.]
;B[pq]

;B[ko]
;W[mm]
;B[ok]
;W[pj]
;B[pr]
;W[rn]C[Might look like completely bad shape, but I thought that I might be able to kill Black's corner and wanted to reduce him while protecting my right area in sente.]
;B[ro]
;W[or]TR[ko][lo][kq][lq]C[I thought there might be enough room for me to kill him, so I played here in preparation fro that and to also cut off the M3 (triangle) group.]
;B[oj]
;W[pi]
;B[km]
;W[mk]C[Keeping the Black groups split while escaping.]

;W[fm]
;B[dl]
;W[il]C[At this point, I thought I had him dominated on the bottom. Though I did see a small possibiliy for life with his forcing moves.]
;B[hl]

;W[kl]
;B[lm]
;W[ki]LB[jj:A]C[This might have been my losing move. I think I was supposed to atari from A (K10) instead. I was too focused on trying to catch that stone in a net.]
;B[gj]LB[kj:A]C[But then Black exposes the aji of the A (L10) stone perfectly.]
;W[gk]
;B[hk]
;W[hj]
;B[ij]
;W[hi]
;B[jj]
;W[jk]C[This goes to show how fundamentally weak my reading is. I'm sure I could have saw this from moves ago, but with the short time, I didn't see it and realize after playing that I lose the race by one liberty. ]
;B[im]
;W[cm]C[I decide to try one final invasion.]
;B[dm]
;W[ck]
;B[dk]
;W[cl]
;B[cj]
;W[bo]C[I try to get fancy.]
;B[cn]C[But Black is too strong.]
;W[bj]C[I'm just flailing around.]
;B[bm]C[And Black ends all discussion. I resign here.])
