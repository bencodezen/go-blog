;B[pd]BL[1786.031]
;W[dd]WL[1795.779]C[As White, I always like to offer Black the opportunity for a cross-fuseki since it kind of negates Black's first move advantage to building a moyo.]
;B[qq]BL[1771.661]C[This is a favorite opening of Bonscott, but I am not a fan of it since I do not think it has very much synergy because the 4-4 looks for flexibility and influence while the 3-3 concerns itself with taking the corner territory.]
;W[dp]WL[1790.056]C[So I like to play a star point in response usually to take advantage of the influence later on.]
;B[fc]BL[1765.734]
;W[cf]WL[1786.33]LB[cc:A][ci:B]C[Calm and normal response. I usually like playing the small knight's response since it (1) probes Black's intention, and (2) gives me sente and a stable group with A and B miai for settling down.]
;B[jd]BL[1757.014]LB[nc:A][qf:B][pj:C]C[Black's intention here shows he's looking for a framework.

Question: White wants to approach the upper right corner since he does not want to give Black a double winged enclosure at C. From which side should he approach: A or B?]
(;W[qf]WL[1783.651]C[Correct. This follows the principle of approaching from the wider side.]
;B[qh]BL[1747.237]C[One space lower pincer is a good response.]
;W[qc]WL[1764.882]LB[pc:A][qd:B]C[Though this is not necessarily wrong, I think that this was a small mistake since it only helped Black build his moyo.

Question: What direction should Black block? A or B?]
(;B[pc]BL[1722.515]C[Correct. This follows the principle of blocking from the side withe the most potential for building territory (aka the top),]
;W[qd]WL[1763.476]
;B[pe]BL[1714.383]
;W[rf]WL[1759.991]LB[qe:A]C[For those who don't know the joseki, this is the correct move for making stable shape and life for later on. Connecting at A leaves a lot of potential problems for later on.]
;B[qb]BL[1708.981]LB[og:A]C[Black's hane here shows his intention at trying to keep his top side. Normal move is to seal White in at A.]
;W[pf]WL[1746.456]LB[pg:A]C[Since Black chose not to seal White in, I decide to break out. However, this move is slow and actually helps Black build the top. A kosumi at A would probably have been better.]

;B[ng]BL[1691.223]
;W[nf]WL[1731.164]C[This was lazy reading on my part. I was just trying to cause aji, but in reality I'm only helping Black build the top.]
;B[oe]BL[1686.683]
;W[mg]WL[1729.501]C[Atari again to leave aji, but still, this is bad.]

;B[pk]BL[1653.773]
;W[mf]WL[1676.946]C[Since I'm safe, I decided to try and make use of my stones at O14 and possibly reduce the top.]
;B[le]BL[1643.205]C[Black tries to protect his top.]
;W[mh]WL[1647.776]TR[ng][nh][ni][oi][pj][pk]C[This move is slow and just seems like a weak move in hindsight. I was trying to weaken the marked group and hopefully get enough strength to destroy the top, but alas, I was just not really thinking that hard for these moves.]
;B[mi]BL[1638.711]
;W[kg]WL[1631.849]C[This is the shape point when you have a row of three stones.]
;B[qk]BL[1637.037]C[Very nice turn for Black. White must respond.]
;W[rk]WL[1626.084]C[This is an overplay.]
;B[rl]BL[1633.694]C[Black promptly punishes.]
;W[rh]WL[1606.932]C[White has no choice.]
;B[rj]BL[1630.286]
;W[ri]WL[1600.009]C[Painful.]
;B[sk]BL[1627.439]C[White gets sente, but White is sealed in and Black has immense thicknesss on the lower right.]

;W[np]WL[1547.772]C[I finally try to reduce the lower right.]
;B[lq]BL[1549.768]C[Nice pincer by Black.]

;B[hp]BL[1468.802]C[Black rising his structure to the 4th line here was very nice.]

(;B[iq]BL[1384.065]C[But Black did not seem interested / did not see the other ko.]
;W[mp]WL[1427.277]C[Simple capture is good enough.]
;B[jr]BL[1381.275]C[This move is note sente, so White was happy to tenuki. At this point though, it should be worth noting that while White may have outfought Black in some areas, Black has more cash and in the respect, White is still behind. Unfortunately, I thought I was still doing just fine.]
;W[dj]WL[1416.445]C[I take a big point and try to build the left.]
;B[cc]BL[1376.062]
;W[dc]WL[1388.634]LB[db:A]C[This might seem contrary to the "block from the wider side" principle, but it is supposed to minimize Black's corner territory. Normal response is A, and you'll see what I mean.]
(;B[cd]BL[1372.441]C[When Black plays this variation though, this might give Black a "corner," but it gives White a lot of thickness for counter reducing his top.]
