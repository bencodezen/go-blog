;W[pp]WL[289.155]
;B[dc]BL[294.26]C[Here marks the beginning of my current favorite fuseki as Black.]
;W[dp]WL[260.099]
;B[cn]BL[292.169]LB[ce:B][ch:A]C[Approach with C6 as a probe to White's intentions. Depending on White's response, Black can choose to either setup a micro-Chinese (A) or setup an orthodox fuseki (B).]
;W[ck]WL[250.57]
;B[ce]BL[277.008]C[Here, since white chooses to pincer, this shows an emphasis on the left side. As a result, a simple corner enlosure was chosen to reduce the value of the value of the left side while expanding possibilities for the top.
]
;W[dn]WL[227.494]
;B[qn]BL[240.538]LB[cl:C][dm:B][cq:A]C[Though White attached with D6, C6 still has multiple ways out and is not that easy to silence. Other options include C3, D7, and possibly C8 (depending on the surrounding stones later on).]
;W[pn]WL[215.02]C[White's attachment here shows his intention to build a grand moyo on the bottom.
]
;B[pm]BL[216.647]
;W[om]WL[200.386]C[This hane is a bit over aggressive because the bottom is still rather open and this leaves cutting points.]
;B[po]BL[168.189]C[Q5 pokes at the shape of the White stones while preparing to establish a base.]
;W[on]WL[196.167]
;B[qp]BL[141.241]C[Continues to establish a base on the third line.]
;W[oo]WL[178.447]
;B[qo]BL[138.674]
;W[pq]WL[175.542]
;B[qq]BL[125.066]LB[op:A]C[This extension further helps Black secure his base in sente because the cut at A works.]
;W[np]WL[164.786]C[Since Black gets third line profit while White gets influence towards the bottom, it's still a decently even trade since White's bottom moyo is far from complete.]
;B[pl]BL[118.974]LB[ol:A]C[Here is a move that I might have not felt inclined to play without frozensoul's influence, but as you can see, this move really shines in its shape along with the way it stretches out on the fourth line towards the center. Another thing to consider as well is the fact that you are preventing White from sealing you in easily and also giving yourself the opportunity to turn at A later on (which would give prospects to a nice right sidewhie reducing the effectiveness of White's bottom moyo.]
;W[ol]WL[114.964]C[White felt this push was necessary, and now White's bottom is looking increasily big if he is given a chance to add another move to it.]
;B[iq]BL[83.412]LB[fq:A][lq:B]C[Since White's P8 eliminated Black's ability to turn and flatten out the bottom (if needed), it was time for Black to invade with J3 (which provides miai for settling at A or B).
bengozen [4k\]: J3 neutralizes the white wall and hurts his ability to form a moyo on the bottom
]
;W[pk]WL[110.659]C[White perceives that this is sente, but this is not because (1) Black is settled and (2) It does not directly threaten the capture of the two marked stones.]
;B[jd]BL[68.146]LB[gq:A][kq:B]C[Since Black has the opportunity to play a bigger point, I chose to start to make my top moyo more imposing.

Question: White wants to approach the bottom stone (J3), which side is best? A or B?]
;W[gq]WL[106.416]C[Correct. This side pushes Black into White's thickness at P5. If White had approached from the other side, it would be an ineffective use of his wall and would violate the principle of "using thickness to make territory."]
;B[lq]BL[63.414]LB[kp:A][lp:B]C[So while M3 seems like a natural move to most kyu players, this is a bit controversial in this position because White can press at A (L14) to try and still form some sort of center moyo (See Move 28 variation). To be clear though, it's not that it's wrong; but it does have its flaws. 

If a player's goal was to settle with light shape while better negating White's wall, B (M4) is an option that frozensoul suggested.
]
(;W[co]WL[103.461]C[With this move, White tries to eliminate the aji of C6 by removing the 3-3 C3 invasion possibility; but you'll see later on that the C6 stone is still going to be a pain. In addition, also notice that Black's probe at C6 has netted him 2 sente moves (since White spent time trying to eliminate aji). So while it may seem like a loss on the left hand side, Black has been gaining much more around the board as a whole.]
;B[nr]BL[8.633]LB[pr:A]C[Black chooses to slide here. This is dual purpose since is (1) Gives Black the option to connect at A if needed later on and (2) Starts to poke out White's eye potential in the P4 area.]
;W[qf]WL[97.38]LB[nd:A][qh:C][pi:B]C[Though this approach move is from the correct side, it is a bit dubious because (1) The White stone at R14 has a 4 space gap between it and and the P9 group (which has not generated any real thickness on the right side) and (2) The Q16 stone is not really in trouble because there is K16 to support it in case a fight breaks out.

Some options to this response include the calm response at A, but frozensoul also thinks that the pincers at B and C would be other good options.]
;B[pf]BL[30]OB[2]C[The reason I chose not to pincer is because R9 would become a rather powerful move and it could result in me having a weak group. As a result, I chose the attach joseki because I wanted to further make an imposing top moyo.
]
(;W[qc]WL[57.56]C[This is a premature invasion that result that benefits Black more than White due to the resulting shape. frozensoul says that White should have Q13 instead to better strengthen his connection the P9 group. For the proper joseki that White should have followed, see the variation at Move 31
]
;B[pc]BL[30]OB[2]LB[qe:A]C[For those who might have preferred a more complicated variation, frozensoul mentioned that A (R15) is a fighting variation that is possible. But I just wanted to keep this position simple and block on the side with the most potential (aka the top).]
;W[qd]WL[54.382]
;B[qe]BL[30]OB[2]C[Black wedges.]
;W[re]WL[37.771]C[White must connect by atari.]
;B[pe]BL[30]OB[2]C[And Black connects with such wonderful shape!]
;W[rf]WL[3.018]C[White must protect his cutting points.]
;B[ph]BL[30]OB[2]LB[cc:E][id:B][ee:D][he:C][qk:A]C[And now Black calmly does a one-point jump which further makes an imposing top moyo while keeping the White groups separated (which opens opportunities for attacks later on).

At this point, I'm sure that some are wondering what a dan player would do as White if they wanted to reduce the top. frozensoul suggested the following points. B, C, and D serve as reduction points while E is a probe in the corner to see how Black responds. 

And though I still have a hard time understanding this, frozensoul states that A (R9) is the biggest move on the board at the moment. Can't explain it, but thought I would at least mention it in the review.]
;W[hd]WL[30]OW[2]C[This is an overplay by White because the invasion is too deep.

Question: What is the best way to attack White?]
;B[jf]BL[30]OB[2]C[Though the standard attacking move in this scenario tends to be the knight's move, this one-point jump is the better option because it puts pressure on White (without leaving any cutting aji a knight's move would) while really working really effectively with the Black wall on the right (notice that there is the ideal 5 space gap).

bengozen [4k\]: This is powerful because it doesn't leave the cutting aji the knight's move would
]
;W[jc]WL[30]OW[2]C[White attaches to try and make shape.]
;B[kc]BL[30]OB[2]TR[ld][md][nd][le][me][ne]C[Black continue to put pressure on White while simultaneously starting to form territory in the N15 area.]
;W[ic]WL[30]OW[2]LB[kd:A]C[White extends to strengthen his group while threatning the cut at A (which would result in complications that would be advantageous to White since it gives him more opportunites to make sabaki while reducing Black's top moyo).]
;B[kd]BL[30]OB[2]C[So, Black chooses the solid connection to allow himself more freedom to attack more severely later on.]
;W[cg]WL[30]OW[2]LB[ec:B][fc:A][hf:C]TR[ic][jc][hd]C[Ouch. Another overplay that leaves a weak White group alone in a sea of Black influence. A (F17) and B (E17) are the only moves at this point. If people are wondering about the one point jump at C (H14), it is not a good option since it doesn't establish a base for White and allows Black to learn at D10 to surround the marked White group from a distance 
]
;B[gc]BL[30]OB[2]C[Black immediately takes the opportunity to eliminate the shape point.]
;W[ip]WL[30]OW[2]LB[pr:A]C[White is feeling behind, so he tries to attack the bottom group; but this is another overplay by White since Black's group is far from dead since he can connect at A if necessary.]
;B[dg]BL[30]OB[2]C[Because of miai on the bottom, Black has time to play this leaning attack.
]
;W[dh]WL[30]OW[2]C[White hane's in respones to the attachment.]
;B[df]BL[30]OB[2]TR[ic][jc][hd]C[But this only makes Black stronger and the marked White group even weaker.]
;W[eh]WL[30]OW[2]C[White thinks he's taking a shape point, but the top group is in tears for help.]
;B[hf]BL[30]OB[2]C[Black's leaning attack was successful and White is practically captured.]
;W[fd]WL[30]OW[2]C[White tries some shenanigans.]
;B[fc]BL[30]OB[2]C[Calm extension.]
;W[gf]WL[30]OW[2]C[White is trying to play light and get out.]
;B[gd]BL[30]OB[2]C[But Black is too strong!]
;W[he]WL[30]OW[2]C[White tries to save the entire group.]
;B[hg]BL[30]OB[2]C[This calm descent in combination with G16 will show that White cannot save all of his stones.]
;W[ge]WL[30]OW[2]
;B[gg]BL[30]OB[2]C[Black prepare to cut him off.]
;W[fg]WL[30]OW[2]C[White tries for the diagonal!]
;B[ff]BL[30]OB[2]C[But there is a weakness!]
;W[ef]WL[30]OW[2]C[You think capturing the stone is good enough?]
;B[eg]BL[30]OB[2]C[Not so!]
;W[fe]WL[30]OW[2]
;B[fh]BL[30]OB[2]C[Now it's a fight! Though the question remains, who has the advantage.]
;W[de]WL[30]OW[2]C[Though White has a few threats, Black is strong and has the advantage in this fight!]
;B[cf]BL[30]OB[2]
;W[ed]WL[30]OW[2]C[White tries to make eye shape.]
;B[dd]BL[30]OB[2]C[Black denies him an eye and here we can see White's shortage of liberties.]
;W[ec]WL[30]OW[2]C[White's looking for a miracle.]
;B[eb]BL[30]OB[2]C[Black seals him in for good.]
;W[db]WL[30]OW[2]C[White tries to exploit the cutting points.]
;B[fb]BL[30]OB[2]C[Solid connection here is bad shape, but it maximize the liberties without permitting tesuji later on if a capturing race occurs.]
