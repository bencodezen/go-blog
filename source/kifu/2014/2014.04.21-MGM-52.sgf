;B[pd]BL[1792.782]C[Black starts out with the ever familiar star point opening.]
;W[dc]WL[1795.045]C[I decided to start with a 3-4 with the strong side facing Black's star stone in order to prevent him from getting an easy approach later on.]
;B[qp]BL[1786.856]C[Well rats. It looks like Black is going for my current favorite opening as Black!]
;W[op]WL[1787.715]C[This move was the first to be influenced by frozensoul's theory on the play style of simply ignoring your opponent. I didn't much care to let Black get an ideal formation by any stretch, so I wanted to complicate things from the start.]
;B[oq]BL[1783.329]C[When Black plays this attachment, I already have in mind what I will do.]
;W[nq]WL[1778.672]C[First I play a single hane.]
;B[pq]BL[1780.525]C[And Black pull backs to keep his stones connected like in the joseki.]
;W[dp]WL[1768.419]LB[np:A]C[And then I intentionally leave the cutting point at A (O4) and take the remaining corner. As a cautionary note to anyone reading this, if you plan on trying this, you better be prepared for a complicated fight unless you're an expert with dealing with this (which I am not at the moment).]
;B[np]BL[1777.989]C[As expected, Black makes the cut.]
;W[mp]WL[1730.11]C[I have to admit that I'm not actually very familiar with how this variation goes down here, but I'm pretty sure I can't tenuki a second time, so I decide to atari once. ]
;B[no]BL[1776.235]LB[mq:A]C[Black extends as expected, but in hindsight, I was unnecessarily strengthening Black. I should have just extended at A (N3).]
;W[qj]WL[1706.924]C[Realizing that I had gotten myself in a bind, I decided to go ahead and split the right side immediately in order to prevent Black from sketching any moyo with this new thickness.]
;B[mq]BL[1773.806]C[Black takes immediate advantage of my second tenuki, and Black is now well ahead in terms of points.]
;W[qf]WL[1656.986]C[Normally I would panic about the bottom, but I decided to go ahead and ignore my opponent again. After all, as any kyu player will attest to, even though Black might have a nice advantage right now, the game is far from over.]
;B[qh]BL[1766.61]C[Black immediately invades which is absolutely fine by me. I was looking for a fight anyways.]
;W[qm]WL[1642.374]LB[nc:D][qc:A][of:B][rh:C]C[Instead of responding directly however, I have to say this might be the first time I was able to walk about from a fight so calmly and quickly. I saw that I had multiple options (A, B, C, or even D) and decided to take a calm and solid extnsion on the lower right while further negating Black's thickness before engaging in the fight..]
;B[lp]BL[1753.533]C[Black spends another move in the lower right. However, it looks like this is a ladder situation. So let's do some practice shall we?

Problem: Does the ladder at N4 (triangle) work in Black's favor?]
(;W[nc]WL[1629.301]C[Answer: Yes. If you can't see it, go back to Move 17 and click on N5.

Here is another move that I liked from this game. The reason is because it gives White a lot of options in terms of how the board will shape out to be. In addition, the double pincer is one that is hard to handle since most players don't get practice with it and it usually results in some complicated fight.]
;B[pf]BL[1750.414]LB[qf:A]C[Black's attachment here is a direct attack on the A (R14) stone.]
;W[qc]WL[1613.042]LB[pc:B][qd:C][pg:A]C[I wasn't familiar with the joseki at the time, so I simply dove in at the 3-3. However, in the joseki, you should hane at A (Q13) once before diving into the 3-3 in order to leave more defects in Black's shape for later on.

Question: What side do you think Black should block on: B (Q17 - Emphasizing the top) or C (R16 - Emphasizing the left)?]
;B[qd]BL[1747.666]LB[qf:A]C[In terms of direction of play, I have to admit that this is one of the few scenarios where I'm a bit conflicted. On one hand, Black wants to keep up the attack on the A (R14). However, Black has little potential on the right and White gets to stabilize the top which is where he has a lot of potential. 

I'm sure that a stronger player would be able to give a more solid answer, but in order to be consistent, it does seem that this is the better direction to block (though it's not necessarily better by a lot).]
;W[pc]WL[1609.527]C[I go ahead and extend to make my group nice and solid.]
;B[cn]BL[1735.479]LB[od:A]C[This is a mistake by Black (at least in my opinion). I think that A (P16) would have been a sente move that would have been critical for stabilizing his group (which you will see later on).]
;W[fq]WL[1596.328]C[With the impending thickness on the right side, I decided that the small knight's move was most appropriate since it would help negate its power while strengthening my corner.]
;B[bp]BL[1732.647]C[Black's small knights move here is something that I am starting to dislike and will probably not be using as often due to the fact that it gives White a number of options on how to respond. As a result, it is essentially asking White which way would be better for him, which is never what you want to give your opponent.]
;W[jd]WL[1543.473]C[So since I could tenuki, I wanted to continue ignoring my opponent whenever possible and thus took one of the last big points on the board.]
;B[ck]BL[1716.754]C[Black chooses to settle his group immediately and try to provoke a response from White.]
;W[de]WL[1528.792]LB[hq:A]C[This move is a bit of an overplay on my part. The lower left corner group really needs another move and could be severely attacked with a move like A (H3) if I'm not careful.]
;B[cg]BL[1714.353]LB[ce:A]TR[dc][de]C[Black extends three spaces to undercut my D17 shimari formation (triangle), but I was not particularly concerned since I wasn't trying to protect the corner. If I wanted the corner, I would have chosen a move like A (C15) instead. In addition, Black's stones were all on the third line, so they didn't seem particularly threatening.]
;W[od]WL[1515.726]C[Considering the analysis on my last move, this again is a bit of an overplay since my lower left corner is still not settled. However, in terms of what I was thinking at the time, I wanted to take the shape point so that I could grow my top moyo.]
;B[gd]BL[1707.188]LB[gd:A]C[Black immediately invades, which was not a bad idea necessarily, but to be honest, this is the kind of situation I love being in.

So the question is: how to attack A (G16)?]
;W[dg]WL[1500.691]LB[gd:A][ci:B]C[I decided to try and use this attachment as a leaning attack against A (G16), but one should remember that A (G16) is really light and can be sacrificed if needed. In addition, this attachment is also not very good since it removes the invasion aji at B (C11).]
;B[ch]BL[1703.935]C[With this calm extension, Black's group is now super stable (albeit rather low).]
;W[gf]WL[1497.335]LB[gd:A][gf:B]C[However, since Black responded, I was at least successful in that now I could severly attack A (G16) with the capping move of B (G14).]
;B[iq]BL[1667.152]LB[cq:A][hq:B]C[This is a pretty decent attack by Black, but I think that the other direction A (C3) would have been bigger since it would steal the corner while unsettling my group. In addition, Black has thickness at M4, so I think the pincer at B (H3) would have been more severe (if Black insists on attacking from this side).]
;W[cq]WL[1488.774]C[Though I help to establish a little base now, Black actually has another move which would attack my group rather severely. Do you know what it is?]
(;B[ie]BL[1656.901]LB[hd:B][he:C][bq:A]C[The answer is A (B3). To see why it is a strong attack, go to Move 36 and click on B3.

Black tries to move out here with a knight's move. However, there is a saying when it comes to haengma (i.e., stone movement): "Knight's move is for attacking, not running!" And the reason for this is because of the cutting point at B (H16) and C (H15).]
;W[ig]WL[1471.202]LB[je:A]C[This attack was rather significant for me when I was playing. The reason is that I debated pushing Black to the center with a move like A (K15), but then I realized that my attack would practically be over once Black escaped nimbly into the center. So being able to realize that and choose the correct direction was an important moment for me.]
;B[ed]BL[1652.413]C[Black peeps.]
;W[dd]WL[1464.826]LB[cf:A]C[And I have no problem connecting solidly because it means I have a chance to take a big corner if I'm able to get sente to come back and play A (C14) later on.]
;B[je]BL[1650.391]C[Black is now forced to run out to the right.]
;W[kd]WL[1454.871]C[I calmly extend to keep pressure on Black while starting to make territory on the top.]
;B[jg]BL[1646.919]C[Black attaches to try and make shape.]
;W[jh]WL[1414.846]C[There is saying: "When attach, hane!" Now while that is not good advice for every situation, I felt that since I wanted to keep Black weak and harrass him, the hane was very appropriate. A word of caution though: If you're going to hane, always read out the crosscut variation to make sure it doesn't turn out poorly for you.]
;B[ih]BL[1643.002]TR[ed][gd][ie][je][jg]C[Black made the crosscut as expected to try and complicate things and help his K15 (triangle) group out.]
;W[hg]WL[1396.01]C[I go ahead and extend from my weakest side to see what direction Black wants to go next.]
;B[kh]BL[1637.309]C[Black decides to make the atari.]
;W[ji]WL[1392.382]C[I happily extend.]
;B[kg]BL[1624.136]LB[jf:A]C[And then Black connects. Now here's a great shape question for you:

Question: How can White best destroy Black's shape around A (K14)?]
;W[ke]WL[1385.874]LB[jf:A]C[Correct! Once you see this, it should become instantly clear that Black's only option to stay connected is to connect at A (K14) and make two empty triangles (which as many of you know is bad shape). In addition, while you are harrassing Black's shape, you've also strengthened your own stones for a greater top moyo!]
;B[if]BL[1612.325]LB[jf:A]C[Black tries to avoid the straight connection at A (K14), but I'm pretty sure you know what I'm going to do next right?]
;W[kf]WL[1379.796]TR[pd][qd][pf][qh]C[Yup... Moves like this come instinctively to me since they turn Black into a huge dumpling. In addition, there is the added bonus that I am gaining power to possibly attack the R16 group (triangle). Muahaha....]
;B[jf]BL[1610.404]C[Even though Black is far from dead, Black has a clump of stones in the center that have not generated any profit at all. I feel this is a big success for White.]
;W[hd]WL[1373.238]C[I decide to continue poking at Black's connections.]
;B[id]BL[1604.809]LB[ic:B][he:A]TR[ed][gd]C[At this time, I was faced with a major decision. (1) If I played A (H15), I would be trying to kill off the G16 group (triangle) and maybe gain 12 points by doing so. Or (2) I could play B (J17) and let Black connect...]
;W[ic]WL[1366.601]LB[he:A]TR[ed][gd]C[Normally I'm so aggressive I would just want to cut at A (H15), but at that time, it was a big moment for me because I was able to consciously decide to let Black connect so I could seal off the top for actual profit instead of the momentary satisfaction of cutting off the G16 group (triangle) and killing them.]
;B[he]BL[1602.093]C[Black puts the H16 stone (triangle) in atari.]
;W[hc]WL[1362.53]C[And then I happily connect because I just solidified a nice chunk of territory on the top.]
;B[ge]BL[1597.404]C[And as an added bonus, Black had to connect in gote so I got sente too! Win win!]
;W[mg]WL[1338.044]TR[pd][qd][pf][qh]C[Believe it or not, at this time I have my eye on the upper right group (triangle), I found this move in order to start a splitting attack against both of Black's weak groups.]
;B[ki]BL[1594.593]TR[jh][ji]C[Black continues to run while reducing the liberties on my K12 (triangle) group.]
;W[jj]WL[1333.485]C[I extend in order to take away any forcing moves that Black would gain if I did not respond (i.e., atari in order to get stronger and get better shape).]
;B[kj]BL[1592.303]LB[hi:B][jk:A]C[When Black extends here once more, I have some concern for the hane at A (J9), but then I realize I can just play the net of B (H11) if needed.]
;W[mi]WL[1326.375]C[So I decide to continue the splitting attack. See how painful it is to get chased? White gets to try fun things while Black is running for dear life and making practically no points.]
;B[oe]BL[1586.21]LB[ne:A]C[Black now realizes his problem and tries to make shape (and probably expecting White to play a move like A (O15).]
;W[qe]WL[1311.492]C[Yeah... I have no intention of following my opponent. After some reading, I read out this extension and am 95% sure that it works. So time to destroy Black's base.]
;B[nd]BL[1581.716]C[Black uses the atari forcing move.]
;W[oc]WL[1308.6]C[I connect solidly.]
;B[pe]BL[1533.188]C[Black then repairs his cutting point.]
;W[rd]WL[1290.424]C[And I'm happy to connect under and leave Black without a base.]
;B[qg]BL[1530.115]LB[rc:A][re:B]C[When Black plays here, I had to check to make sure there wasn't any crazy cutting aji around A (S17) and B (S15).]
;W[og]WL[1279.311]LB[rc:A][re:B]C[But after a few seconds, I was felt confident that there was nothing there. So I went ahead and found this shape point and thought as I played this move, "No eye shape for you!"]
;B[pg]BL[1526.285]TR[nd][pd][qd][oe][pe][pf]C[Black connects his group in bad shape. If you're wondering what Black might have done instead, he might have considered sacrificing the Q16 stones (triangle) and using it as aji to escape into the center. Granted, that would still be a huge win for White, but this makes the ENTIRE group super heavy.]
;W[oh]WL[1266.773]C[This is another move I'm proud of since it's a very simple move that maintains excellent shape in relation to the rest of my stones while removing any eye shape potential for Black.]
;B[rg]BL[1522.146]LB[re:A][ri:B]TR[qe][qf]C[Black descends here to threaten to capture my R15 stones (triangle) with A (S15) and aim to make an eye with a move like B (S11).]
(;W[re]WL[1248.817]C[This might seem like bad shape at first bat, but I could see that a life and death problem was about to occur. And based on all the practice I did on the trip, the last thing you want to do is give your opponent forcing moves when he/she is trying to live. 

For an example, go back to Move 75 and click on T14.]
;B[rj]BL[1517.628]C[Black goes ahead and attaches to try and make life.]
;W[rk]WL[1236.773]LB[ri:A]C[Some players might have considered the hane at A (S11) instead, but after some reading, I felt this hane was sufficient since it kept my stones connected and strong while leaving Black only one eye (and I did not see a second eye forming anywhere else in the area).]
;B[qi]BL[1512.855]LB[ri:A][pj:B]C[Black tries to get fancy with the bump. At this point though, White must not be tempted into making the atari at A (S11) to remove Black's eye because Black will respond with the counter atari of B (Q10) and claw towards the center in hopes of escaping.]
;W[pj]WL[1225.219]C[This calm extension here was the beginning of Black's death sentence. After all, don't forget, in order to kill a group, you must first have it firmly surrounded.]
;B[oi]BL[1508.842]LB[nk:A]C[Black tries to get fancy now and I now had to ask myself what I wanted to do. At this point, I was considering a move like A (O9) in order to capture the group on "a larger scale." However, I remembered that Kageyama wrote about how amateur players always try to do thing like this and ending up regretting it later when their opponent manages to break free or live.]
;W[pi]WL[1209.654]LB[nk:A]TR[nd][pd][qd][oe][pe][pf][pg][qg][rg][qh][qi][rj]C[With this cut, Black's group (triangle) is just dead and White now has an easy 40 points in the bank that Black can do nothing about. Though I will probably never get the chance to ask Kageyama what he thought of this move, I would like to think he would approve such a solid move.]
;B[oj]BL[1502.197]LB[oi:A]C[Black tries to run out his A (P11) stone.]
;W[ok]WL[1204.205]TR[ed][gd][id][ge][he][ie][je][if][jf][jg][kg][kh][ki][kj]C[I go ahead and give chase while remembering that the K15 group (triangle) is still eyeless and can still come under attack.]
;B[nj]BL[1499.128]C[Black can only escape in bad shape.]
;W[mj]WL[1183.735]LB[kj:1][nj:2]C[And then I split the groups apart to keep Black occupied.]
;B[nk]BL[1497.346]LB[ph:A][pk:B]TR[pi][pj][qj][ok][rk][qm]C[Black continues to run, but I notice a weakness in the A (Q12) and B (Q9) area since my Q11 stones (triangle) are not alive yet and could be killed if I am overly aggressive and forget my own weaknesses.]
;W[ol]WL[1175.546]C[So I extend calmly to ensure that Black cannot take advantage of those cutting points.]
;B[nl]BL[1491.648]C[Black continued to give chase.]
;W[ll]WL[1145.322]LB[om:A]C[But I did not see anything terribly threatening about a black hane at A (P7), so I continued my splitting attack.]
;B[om]BL[1473.323]TR[pi][pj][qj][ok][rk][ol][qm]C[Black tries to attack my Q10 group (triangle).]
;W[pm]WL[1124.773]LB[pk:A][pl:B]C[But with this extension here, it nullifies Black's attack and neither the atari at A (Q9) or B (Q8) work. Click either to see what I mean.]
(;B[jk]BL[1469.751]C[Black then returns to the hane here, but if you remember back at Move 63, I already had a plan for this. Do you remember what it is?]
;W[hi]WL[1120.416]LB[ih:A]TR[jh][ji][jj]C[That's right! The net here ensure that my K12 stones (triangle) are safe and that the A (J12) stone is firmly captured.]
;B[ph]BL[1465.61]LB[pk:A]C[Black the connects here to threaten the double atari at A (Q9).]
(;W[pk]WL[1112.442]C[Thought it's in bad shape, I felt this was the strongest move because it removed any forcing moves that White would gain if I had play another move like A (R9). To see what I mean, go back to Move 95 and click on S9.]
;B[on]BL[1441.332]C[Black then extends to connect his groups together.]
;W[mf]WL[1076.564]C[I'm not sure that this move was necessary, but I felt that my groups were too loosely connected and could get cut off. So while this seems slow, at the time I felt it was necessary in order to fully claim the upper right corner as my own (and not get forced into a capturing race later on).]
;B[me]BL[1428.58]LB[lf:A]C[Black's hane here threatened to make the wedge at A (M14). ]
;W[lf]WL[1043.531]C[This pained me to make double empty triangles, but this was the strongest move in order to connect and still maintain the maximum liberties and remove any possibility of Black trying to start some sort of capturing race.]
;B[mc]BL[1426.884]C[Black now tries to make eye shape.]
;W[ld]WL[1036.299]C[Again, really bad shape on my part, but I wanted to saw aji in the top for making eyes and felt that any other slack move might have given him a chance to get an eye in sente. And since Black is looking for a miracle to turn the game around, I wanted to squash it immediately.]
;B[md]BL[1423.925]C[Black connects in hopes of making an eye at the top.]
;W[kb]WL[1026.938]LB[kb:A]TR[hc][ic][hd][jd][kd][ld][ke][kf][lf][mf][mg][og][oh][mi][mj][ll]C[I decide to make a defensive move and take the shape point at A (L18) because if you look carefully, my marked groups is not quite alive yet. If I did not play here, Black might take the point for himself and call the life of my entire group into question.]
;B[si]BL[1418.929]TR[pi][pj][qj][ok][pk][rk][ol][pm][qm]C[Black now makes an eye, and while it seems stupid since there doesn't seem to be another way for him to make a second eye, it does start to threaten the life of the Q11 group (triangle).]
;W[ql]WL[997.436]LB[ro:A]C[This is probably the most shameful move I made the entire game. Instead of simply sliding at say A (S5) for instanc (to expand my eye space, I went for instant small life. *hangs head in shame*]
;B[ff]BL[1407.835]TR[gf][hg][ig][jh][hi][ji][jj]C[Black's hane here seemed to aim at cutting off the H13 group (triangle) and possibly killing them.]
;W[fg]WL[989.577]LB[dg:A]C[I had no intentiosn of letting that happen, so I made a calm move to connect to my A (D13) stone.]
;B[lk]BL[1387.146]TR[oi][nj][oj][nk][nl]SQ[ed][gd][id][ge][he][ie][je][ff][if][jf][jg][kg][kh][ki][kj][jk][lk]C[Black's kosumi (i.e., diagonal) here threatened to connect to his O10 group (triangle), but at this point, I knew that trying to kill the K15 group (square) was unreasonable.]
;W[cf]WL[966.394]C[So I came back to the upper left corner. Now let me mention that I had been staring at this move for sometime, and decided this was the correct time to play it. If I'm not mistaken, this move is huge since it claims a rather large corner for White.]
;B[gh]BL[1383.76]LB[gg:B][ih:A]C[Black then makes a nice peep that threatens to pull out the A (J12) stone while also threatening the cut at B (G13).]
;W[hh]WL[933.757]LB[gg:A]TR[jh][ji][jj]C[When I made this move, I thought I would be fine; but in hindsight, this move here was a bit of an overplay and was small-sighted. The reason is because the three stone (triangle) have served their purpose. Black was not going to die anyways so it would have been better to  connect at A (G13) instead and then consider taking sente to reduce the center.]
;B[nh]BL[1368.281]LB[mh:A]TR[mi][mj]C[When I was checking the connection of my groups in this area, I have to admit that I did not consider Black playing here. And out of sheer stupidity I almost Played A (N12) to save my two marked stones (triangle). 

If you don't see why it's stupid, click on N12.]
(;W[ng]WL[914.685]C[Once again, this is ugly but gains an additional point (O14) for White.]
;B[mh]BL[1365.894]TR[mi][mj]C[And since Black has to finish cutting off the stones (triangle), White gets sente too.]
;W[bq]WL[893.68]C[After some thought, I finally decide to settle my corner group since the center looked semi-dangerous now and I had no intentions of letting Black reverse the game by chasing my corner group.]
;B[gr]BL[1362.55]C[Black makes the small knight move to threaten my corner eye space.]
;W[fr]WL[887.957]C[So I descend solidly and block.]
;B[gg]BL[1357.259]C[Black finally makes the cut here.]
;W[hf]WL[876.784]C[When I connected here, I admit that I thought I had a sure way out of this.]
;B[fh]BL[1350.575]C[Black's atari here was expected.]
;W[eg]WL[870.396]C[And based on my reading at the time, I thought this connection would work in my favor.]
;B[ef]BL[1342.272]LB[df:A]C[Black extends to threaten the cut at A (D14).]
;W[ei]WL[860.946]C[And this was where my reading got me to earlier. In other words, I thought I had the net.]
;B[ij]BL[1335.732]LB[df:A]TR[jh][ji][jj]C[When Black makes the atari here, I really should have just sacrificed the K11 stones (triangle) and connected at A (D14). You'll see why in a few moves.]
;W[ii]WL[856.459]C[However, greed got the best of me as I responded in a mere 5 seconds and automatically saving the stones. If you look carefully though, I am actually in a bit of trouble. Even though my group has an eye, it was very near death and I was not as safe as I had thought.]
;B[hj]BL[1277.745]LB[gi:A]C[Black extension here threatened the atari at A (G11).]
;W[gi]WL[853.064]C[So clearly I had to escape.]

;W[ag]C[You'll connect under. No problem right?]
;B[bj]LB[ai:A]C[What about this move? Now Black is threatening to capture your two stones with an atari at A (A11). And since you were trying to reduce, this seems like a waste if Black gains two stones in his own territory. On the other hand, do you really want to give sente to Black? 

So after these considerations, the pull back at B12 is not the best endgame option if you want sente.]))
(;B[bh]C[If Black blocks here.]
;W[ci]C[White will try to connect to his allies.]
;B[di]C[Black will cut. Looks like White failed right?]
;W[cl]C[But now this atari works for White.]
(;B[dm]C[If Black extends...]
;W[bk]C[White ataris and White's reduction move was immensely successful.])
(;B[bl]C[Black can try to prevent the D7 variation.]
;W[dm]LB[bk:A]C[But White can just capture and get sente since Black still needs to protect the A (B9).])))
(;W[gb]C[So this was the first move that came to me instinctively as I'm sure it did for some of you. After all, White looks like he'll be super alive right?]
;B[fb]C[Black would definitely hane.]
;W[ha]LB[gb:A]TR[fb]C[And then I imagine you would probably play a move ilke this to protect your eye shape and ensure your group is alive. Easy peasy right? 

But now draw your attention to White's upper left corner. Black's new marked stone is anchored on the second line and in prime position to reduce White's corner. Not too great. 

Since I was feeling a bit behind, I didn't want to give Black an easy method for reducing my territory. And thus this is the reason I did not play the hane at A (G18).]))
(;B[el]C[So if Black tries to cut.]
;W[ek]C[White will make this atari forcing move.]
;B[dl]C[Black will extend to keep White cut off.]
;W[dj]C[But then White can make life with this diagonal. ]
;B[dk]C[This is the most aggressive sequence that Black can do next to threaten to kill White.]
;W[gj]LB[di:A]C[But then White can play here to make a miai for life. The obvious one is A (D11) which makes a second eye and life, but the other one is a bit more complicated and will be shown in the next few moves.]
;B[ej]LB[di:A]TR[ek][fk][fl]C[Black's throw-in here is the way to keep White at one eye. White cannot connect at A (D11) and make his second eye since the E9 stones (triangle) are in atari.]
;W[fj]C[So White will capture.]
;B[di]C[And then Black will falsify the second eye. Now the question is: How does White live? I'll show you the simplest way next.]
;W[gm]C[White will atari here to threaten to connect his groups again.]

;W[ik]LB[hk:A]TR[hj][ij]C[This atari is the strongest one to make and puts the J10 stones (triangle) in guaranteed capture. If Black connects at A (G9), he will be in self atari and be captured immediately. White is alive.]))
(;W[di]TR[dg][eg][fg]C[If White chooses to save his E13 stones (triangle)...]
;B[ce]C[Black will make this atari here.]
;W[bf]C[White can try to extend...]
;B[be]LB[bd:B][bg:A]C[But Black will keep a firm grip on the White stones. If you think White can run, click on A (B13). If you think the belly slapping tesuji works, click on B (B16).]
(;W[bg]C[And no matter how White tries to struggle...]
;B[bh]TR[bf][cf][bg]SQ[dc][dd][de]C[Black will just keep his vice grip and the stones (triangle) will die for sure. On top of that, in this variation, White's corner has been significantly reduced.

(;W[bd]C[White can try to get fancy.]

;B[bg]LB[fb:B][ec:A]C[Black reduction will be successful. In addition, White still needs to add a move like A (E17) or B (F18) to prevent Black from harrassing and possibly killing the corner later. So this is still a success for Black.])))

;B[sk]C[And then Black will capture and White will be in ruins.])))
(;W[sf]LB[rc:A]C[I had originally thought about playing here for good shape. And if we ignore the cutting aji of A (S17).]
;B[sg]LB[re:A]TR[qe][qf]C[This is a very simple example of a forcing move that threatens the definite capture of the two marked stones by playing at A (S15). White HAS to respond, and as a result Black can take sente to possibly gain a second eye. This is bad juju when trying to kill your opponent's group.

Note: I'm not trying to say that Black can live in this situation, but this is just to illustrate the importance of not giving your opponents forcing moves when trying to kill them.]))
(;B[bq]C[Correct. When Black extends here, it starts to chip away at White's eye space while gaining territory and practically guaranteeing the safety of his group while securing more of the left side.]
;W[br]C[Even if White tries to hane to get eye space.]
;B[dr]C[Black can try invasions like this later on if the surrounding conditions are ripe. As White, that doesn't look to comfortable does it? White will probably have to run to the center and get chased by Black. And while White probably won't die, Black will probably get serious profit off the chase. So bad bad bad.]))
