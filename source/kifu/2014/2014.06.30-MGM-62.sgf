;B[qd]BL[1793.463]C[With my game being erratic lately, I've been starting with the 3-4 more often in order prevent me from consistently aiming for moyos (which I typically do when I have star points). 

And just to clarify, my feeling that 3-4 is calmer than star point is absolutely not valid in any sense. It's simply an emotion I've attached to the moves as a result of my own experience, play style, and comfort level with the moves. But I must stress that you can play calm with any move no matter what. ]
;W[pq]WL[1792.279]C[Though this move cannot be considered "wrong" per say, I personally consider it a poor choice by White in regards to direction of play. The reason is because Black already showed intentions of building the right side with his 3-4. As a result, White exposing the weak side of his 3-4 to Black's intended area of development is a mistake.]
;B[dd]BL[1782.267]C[I originally intended on choosing alternating 3-4 as my opening for Black, but with White's Q3 move (triangle), I thought it might be perfect for setting up my old friend the Chinese Opening.]
;W[cp]WL[1788.299]C[White's 3-4 here limits some of my potential with the Chinese Opening, but overall I liked the fuseki for me since it was my move next.]
;B[po]BL[1776.391]C[With this approach move, I wanted to probe White's intentions to figure out whether or not setting up the Chinese Opening would be viable or not.]
;W[cf]WL[1783.045]C[To my shock, White ignored me and approached in the upper left instead. And to be clear, this is not a mistake in any way, shape, or form. It's simply more of a playing style than anything else.]
;B[fc]BL[1695.546]C[With White's approach, I wasn't sure I would be able to effectively setup the Chinese Opening, so I chose the simple and calm knight's move to gain sente and strengthen my corner group.]
;W[dj]WL[1755.185]C[White's choice here signaled to me that he was interested in making a moyo.]
;B[fq]BL[1656.147]LB[ep:A]C[Though many players would approach at A (E4) to prevent White from getting the ideal enclosure, this formation has undergone a lot of study and it is considered better for White if Black plays A (E4). And from what I've learned, the low two space approach is the proper way to limit White's formation.]
;W[lq]WL[1743.226]TR[fq]C[This move bewildered me because the three space extension is a really wishy washy move. It doesn't really help the corner, and yet it doesn't pincer the F3 stone (triangle) at all.]
(;B[pj]BL[1523.936]LB[cq:A][iq:B][qq:C]TR[fq]C[Because the three space extension is not normal and impacted the corner more than my F3 stone (triangle), I decided to try a different move as well so that White did not end up with a better than average result. 

I chose this move because I was thinking of possibly setting up the high Chinese formation if I get the opportunity. In addition, since my F3 stone (triangle) had a miai for settling [A (C3) or B (J3)\], I felt choosing a direction in this area would not serve my fuseki very well. So I chose not to respond in this area.

In case you're wondering however, Justin later commented that this was a bad move. His advice is that I should have simply attached at C (R3) and kept it simple. Go back to Move 61 and click on R3 to see the sequence.]
;W[oo]WL[1706.798]LB[on:A][pp:B]C[White's attachment here surprised me once again since I was pretty sure it wasn't joseki. I debated primarily between A (P6) and B (Q4). ]
;B[on]BL[1472.624]LB[no:A][pp:B]C[At first, I was worried that this hane would induce White A (O5), but I decided it wasn't a big deal since M3 (triangle) was too close and it would be difficult for White to gain much from the extension since he would be overconcentrated.

In addition, since I had a moyo strategy in mind, the hane seemed to be more consistent with the rest of my moves on the board.

B (Q4) would have been bad shape since I would be "butting my own head against my opponent's stone" and did not seem to be consistent with the rest of my moves, so I decided against it.]
;W[op]WL[1684.165]LB[nn:A]C[To my surprise, White pulled back to keep his stone connected. And almost by sheer instinct, I wanted to extend at A (O6) to limit White's potential and increase my influence.]
;B[pm]BL[1426.673]LB[nm:D][nn:C][pn:A][qn:B]C[However, after taking 10 seconds to calm down and really think about it, I decided that the cutting point at A (Q6) would give White too big of a corner. So I decided to make this tiger's mouth (as opposed to B (R6) in order to give myself the ability to easily make shape for influence later if White hanes at C (O6) (which would induce Black D (O7)).]
;W[qo]WL[1680.957]C[White's attachment here was quite nice since I can't cut off the stone.]
;B[qn]BL[1409.969]C[So I made the ponnuki here to complete my shape and gain sente.]
;W[pp]WL[1677.74]C[This connection is bad shape in my eyes, but I must acknowledge that White's corner is very big. In addition, my ponnuki is too close to my Q10 stone (triangle) which makes my stones overconcentrated. So overall, I think this result is bette for White.]
;B[kd]BL[1331.794]C[I had no interest in fighting a ko since there were no threats on the board right now, so I took sente to make the high Chinese Opening and continue with my moyo strategy.]
;W[nn]WL[1673.891]C[White's hane here starts to build some influence on the bottom, but I anticipated this.]
;B[nm]BL[1307.011]C[Now I can hane and keep good shape while building my influence.]
;W[pn]WL[1672.336]C[White tries to start the ko.]
;B[om]BL[1293.833]C[But I had no interest and was happy connecting here to continue building my influence.]
;W[mm]WL[1671.057]LB[ml:B][mn:A]C[When White double hane here, I really debated making the atari at A (N6) and the following up with a second atari at B (N8). ]
;B[ml]BL[1265.077]C[However, I decided to leave the aji for later and simply continue building my influence.]
;W[lm]WL[1667.637]TR[fq]C[White extends to build his bottom moyo, but I wasn't concerned since I felt I was getting the beter deal since I had F3 (triangle) to negate a lot of White's bottom potential.]
;B[ll]BL[1252.636]C[I extend to continue expanding my influence.]
;W[kl]WL[1664.102]LB[mn:A]C[White hanes again, and I'm really starting to eye the cutting point aji of A (N6).]
;B[kk]BL[1191.029]C[Since my moyo is larger than his, I continue following.]
;W[jl]WL[1659.805]C[Extend again.]
;B[jk]BL[1115.966]C[I extend once more.]
;W[od]WL[1648.013]C[And then White invades! ]
;B[pf]BL[1078.755]TR[kd]C[With the L16 stone (triangle) already pincering White, the knight's move is normally the best response in this situation as it attacks White while also starting to solidify the right side.]
;W[ld]WL[1638.022]LB[qc:A]C[Since White has been playing a number of odd moves, it shouldn't have surprised me when he attached here. Normally White tries to gain a partial base by attaching at A (R17) first. ]
;B[ne]BL[1041.819]LB[kc:A]C[My initial instinct was the descend at A (L17), which Justin said is the move I should've played. However, I was afraid White would get a better than average result if I did (for some delusional reason) and thought I would be clever with this peep since it threatened to split White into multiple groups.

Final verdict? This move was awful. Should have just played A (L17). Haha.]
;W[qc]WL[1623.27]C[White decides to finally attach to try and settle.]
;B[rc]BL[1023.223]C[I hane (as in the normal joseki) to prevent White from easily settling in the corner.]
;W[ke]WL[1598.826]LB[pc:A]TR[kd]C[White normally draws back now at A (Q17) to connect his stones, but he chose to try and punish my tenuki earlier when he attached to my stone with this hane since he is now one step ahead in the contact fight against my L16 stone (triangle).]
;B[le]BL[1004.07]C[Though I normally try to avoid crosscuts since it gives the opponent an opportunity to make sabaki more easily, I felt it was appropriate in this case White would have multiple weak groups to deal with (or at least that's what I envisioned).]
;W[kc]WL[1560.18]C[White ataris.]
;B[jd]BL[996.933]C[I must extend to keep his groups separated.]
;W[me]WL[1557.141]C[He ataris once more.]
;B[lf]BL[991.074]C[Extend again to keep White cut off.]
;W[md]WL[1555.814]C[And when White connects here...]
;B[mf]BL[982.417]C[I was happy to turn and seal him into the top side. 

However, if we think about the result right now, White is getting a chance to settle with decent territory in an area where Black was REALLY strong. So while I was satisfied at the time, I think White got the better deal here.]
;W[jc]WL[1553.245]C[White now extends along the top to stabilize his group while making more territory.]
(;B[nd]BL[964.76]C[I mistakenly think that this would be sente and worth a lot since I could swallow up a big corner. However, I missed the vital point in my shape.]
;W[id]WL[1527.557]C[Disaster strikes. This point was vital for me to play, but White getting this point is huge. I'll explain more in a couple of moves when it will be more apparent why.]
;B[je]BL[955.414]C[I have to run now to try and prevent White from gaining a significant influence in the center.]
;W[ie]WL[1524.375]C[White can atari once more.]
;B[jf]BL[947.476]C[And with this final extension, it is now easy to show you why this is so bad for me. (1) My moyo is pretty much flattened out now and has little opportunity for expansion. (2) My corner stones (triangle) are clearly isolated now, which means they can come under severe attack. 

AHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!

In case you don't appreciate how different this position looks compared to what I should have played, go back to Move 46 and click on J16. Then I want you to stare at that position and repeat to yourself, "This is infinitely better for Black than what happened in the actual game. This is infinitely better for Black than what happened in the actual game."
]
;W[nc]WL[1522.817]C[White now blocks as expected.]
;B[mc]BL[929.256]C[So I embark on my double cut to take the corner.]
;W[lc]WL[1520.853]C[White connects.]
;B[oc]BL[920.32]C[Cut again.]
;W[nb]WL[1508.564]C[White extends, but this is a small mistake since it gives Black the follow up sente move.]
;B[ob]BL[910.263]LB[mb:A]TR[nb][nc]C[Black descends and threatens A (N18) which would capture the O18 stones (triangle).]
;W[mb]WL[1506.661]C[So White must capture in gote and Black gets sente!]
;B[oe]BL[891.697]C[But unfortunately I was wrong and had to come back and secure my corner with this atari.]
;W[ik]WL[1495.42]LB[il:A]C[So White got to take this critical shape point. Words cannot express how different it would have been if Black had gotten the hane at A (J8) instead.]
;B[il]BL[859.812]C[I decide to finally cut to try and exploit the cutting aji of White's shape, but this was rather premature as it fails.]
;W[kn]WL[1492.225]C[White sees the aji and protects his cutting points.]
;B[im]BL[839.489]LB[hk:A]C[And then like an idiot I try to descend here thinking White won't see that I'm up to something. To see my sequence, click on A (H9).]
(;W[jn]WL[1319.751]C[White see it and strengthens his shape. Epic fail on my part.]
;B[ij]BL[821.77]C[I decide to atari in order to expand my moyo a bit, but you'll see that White gets the better result in this exchange.]
;W[hk]WL[1317.821]C[White extends.]
;B[hj]BL[802.029]LB[gk:A]C[I extend again to threaten the atari at A (G9).]
;W[gk]WL[1315.682]C[White knows better than to let me get that and extends.]
;B[iq]BL[785.171]C[With White's bottom so big now, I felt it was time for me to take my base now so White did not convert the entire area into his territory.]
;W[hp]WL[1303.291]C[White presses me down and threatens to cut.]
;B[hq]BL[763.044]C[I have to keep my stones connected.]
;W[gp]WL[1260.532]LB[gq:A]C[White takes the shape point and threatens the put and cut at A (G3).]
;B[eq]BL[731.917]C[So I extend calmly to strengthen my group and expand my base.]
;W[eo]WL[1250.722]C[White then seals me with this knight's move. And if you look, White's left area is actually quite impressive now.]
;B[bd]BL[687.055]TR[id][ie]C[I decide to defend my corner first because having White invade at the 3-3 and force my group to run would be a disaster (since Black would have no way to settle down to the wall at J16 (triangle)).]
;W[ed]WL[1185.175]C[White attaches to threaten to cut while gaining more influence.]
;B[ec]BL[676.911]C[I have no choice but to keep connected.]
;W[if]WL[1182.881]C[White now threatens the atari at A (K13) to gain a foothold into my moyo and reduce it.]
;B[jg]BL[662.153]C[So I extend to prevent that.]
;W[dr]WL[1179.533]C[This move was great by White since it simultaneoulsy makes corner territory while undermining my entire group's base.]
;B[er]BL[646.912]C[Out of desperation, I make the empty triangle because I'm not sure what else to do and worry I might die.]
;W[de]WL[1176.99]LB[cd:A]C[White hanes here threatening the atari at A (C16).]
;B[cd]BL[614.45]C[So I connect to solidify my corner group, but man White's left area is so big...]
;W[rn]WL[1171.067]C[And then White takes this atari which increases his lower right territoy while reducing my territory. Oy vey...]
;B[gj]BL[566.731]LB[fk:A]C[I try to take sente and make a dent with a hane at A (F9).]
;W[ql]WL[1158.562]C[Beautiful haengma by White, but ouch....]
;B[qm]BL[545.669]C[I connect, but see the inevitable coming....]
;W[rm]WL[1146.521]C[My "big" moyo territory is now about to be reduce significantly.]
;B[rk]BL[544.347]LB[nl:A]C[I try to block out of desperation, but this is an overplay because White's cut at A (O8) works now (which I see but hope that White misses it because I'm feeling REALLY behind at this point).

If you can't see it, click on A (O8) to see what I mean.]
(;W[qk]WL[1143.386]C[White doesn't seem to see it yet and is bent on simply reducing my area.]
;B[qj]BL[494.088]C[So I block.]
;W[rj]WL[1139.707]C[White cuts.]
;B[ri]BL[483.709]C[I atari.]
;W[rl]WL[1132.119]LB[sj:A]C[Then White intends to conncet in sente because he probably expects Black to capture the stone at A (T10) now.]
;B[nk]BL[474.422]LB[nl:A]C[But I couldn't let the cutting point of A (O8) be available any longer.]
;W[fk]WL[1116.798]C[And then White takes sente to take away my hane... NOOO!!!!!]
;B[ch]BL[462.737]C[Since I was really behind, I felt I had to invade and try to complicate things; but in reality this is not deep enough. I'm not sure where else would have worked, but seeing as I'm behind, I needed to try for a hail mary at this point.]
;W[ci]WL[1080.626]C[White kicks.]
;B[dh]BL[451.804]TR[gj][hj][ij]C[So I stand up and aim to connect back with G10 (triangle).]
;W[eh]WL[1051.421]C[White tries to severely attack with this attachment, but this is a bad attack since Black will use this contact play to gain strength and try to escape.]
;B[eg]BL[421.752]C[So I hane to start a fight.]
;W[ef]WL[1045.793]C[And then White tries this fancy clamp.]
;B[fg]BL[411.251]LB[ei:A]C[Which I'm happy to ignore and simply extend and threaten the atari at A (E11).]
;W[gf]WL[1032.685]LB[ei:A]C[White tries to keep his groups connected here, but a move like A (E11) would probably have been more effective since White is winning.]
;B[ei]BL[366.745]C[Since White did not protect, I quickly secured my group. However, in case you're wondering, White is still 20 points ahead.]
;W[ok]WL[1028.128]LB[jr:A]C[White continues to embark on reducing Black's territory, but in reality White should have simply continued the attack on the bottom with a move like A (K2) to win the game with no opportunity for Black to come back.]
;B[oj]BL[354.616]C[I block.]
;W[pl]WL[1016.176]LB[nl:A]C[White threatens the snapback with A (O8).]
;B[nl]BL[281.987]C[And though it pained me to do this, I felt it was necessary to connect.]
;W[ej]WL[992.565]LB[jr:A]C[And then White proceed to defend, but again, the attack at A (K2) would be much better.]
;B[kr]BL[236.959]C[Even though my ladder at A (F12) no longer works, I waste no time in defend my bottom group in hopes of finding a way to turn this around.]
;W[lr]WL[926.745]C[White blocks.]
;B[kq]BL[221.588]C[so I expand my eye space while trying to create aji and reduce White's area.]
;W[gb]WL[924.388]C[White tries to reduce my corner territory, but I felt I had to gamble on the face that my group could live and instead take sente to focus on White's area.]
;B[io]BL[183.263]C[So I start to create some aji with this jump.]
;W[ip]WL[909.073]C[White cuts of course.]
;B[jo]BL[174.811]C[But I have a plan...]
;W[jp]WL[907.013]C[White tries to keep Black separated.]
;B[kp]BL[151.295]C[I threaten to connect.]
;W[ko]WL[903.186]C[White cuts.]
;B[km]BL[140.961]C[But I have a tesuji planned: throw-in!!]
;W[jm]WL[899.709]C[White captures.]
;B[mn]BL[139.012]C[And now this atari works!]
;W[no]WL[896.105]C[White connects.]
;B[ln]BL[137.653]LB[km:A][lo:B]C[But I have this atari too! If White connects at A (L7), then I would capture the entire group with B (M5).]
;W[in]WL[875.4]C[White sees the problem and embarks to save his stones.]
;B[km]BL[125.634]C[So I capture now.]
;W[lp]WL[869.225]C[And then White cuts me off to prevent me from connecting / further reducing his territory.]
;B[dq]BL[84.038]C[So I embark on further reducing White's territory.]
;W[cq]WL[865.364]C[White blocks.]
;B[cr]BL[73.476]C[I cut to give myself a possibility for one eye.]
;W[br]WL[863.638]C[White counter-ataris and probably expected me to capture.]
;B[bi]BL[34.657]C[But I have no intention of going down quietly and take my sente to keep trying to poke holes in White's territory.]
;W[bj]WL[855.233]C[White blocks.]
;B[di]BL[31.578]C[So I connect to atari and hope that White connects.]
;W[cj]WL[852.407]C[And he does! So I got to connect all my stones in sente. Woot!]
;B[fb]BL[30]OB[5]C[I decide to block the corner now since it's my only chance to keep the territory semi-close.]
;W[cs]WL[825.672]C[White captures and removes an eye.]

;B[mp]BL[30]OB[4]LB[mo:B][es:A]C[Moment of truth: I'm pretty sure I'm still behind, so simply descending at A (E1) to make life would give White the initiative to seal the game in his favor.
