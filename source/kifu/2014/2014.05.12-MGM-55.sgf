;B[pd]BL[53]C[Star point for balance and flexibility.]
;W[cd]WL[60]C[I personally feel this is a big mistake by White fuseki wise because it exposes the weak side to Black's star point stone from the get go. This allows Black to predict what the next few moves will develop like.]
;B[pp]BL[45]C[I plan to take advantage of White's mistake, so I play another star point to emphasize fast development.]
;W[dq]WL[59]C[White plays the komoku (3-4) here now, and while the strong side faces Black, it's a little late now.]
;B[ed]BL[43]C[Black approaches the weak side without any doubt.]
;W[gc]WL[56]C[I'm really unfamiliar with this one space low pincer.]
;B[cc]BL[3]C[But I'm always ready to fight.]
;W[dc]WL[52]C[White hanes to separate.]
;B[dd]BL[586]C[I cut White to fight.]
;W[ec]WL[50]C[White extends to strengthen his weakest stone.]
;B[fc]BL[531]C[The wedge works at this point and is the strongest response in this fight.]
;W[fb]WL[48]C[White connects underneath.]
;B[fd]BL[523]LB[eb:A][ce:B]C[Black is happy to connect solidly and now aims at A (E18) or B (C15).]
;W[db]WL[44]C[White protects his top group.]
;B[ce]BL[513]C[So I'm happy to take this thickness (which faces the weak side of the lower left).]
;W[bd]WL[41]C[White extends, but I'm not concerned.]
;B[gd]BL[509]C[I go ahead and extend here to gain more thickness.]
;W[hd]WL[33]LB[hc:A]C[White double hanes, but he should have just extended at A (H17) instead.]
;B[gb]BL[489]C[So now I can cut.]
;W[hc]WL[30]C[White connects.]
;B[fa]BL[488]TR[db][dc][ec]C[And then I atari here to threaten the D18 stones (triangle).]
;W[cb]WL[21]C[White sees the threat and turns.]
;B[eb]BL[481]LB[be:A]TR[gc][hc][hd]C[I decide to go ahead and make a clean capture and aiming at A (B15) or the H17 stones (triangle).]
;W[be]WL[20]C[White turns.]
;B[cf]BL[466]C[I decide to extend to keep White low and sealed from the center.]
;W[bf]WL[19]C[White extends.]
;B[cg]BL[450]C[And then I extend once more to preserve my shape.]
;W[hb]WL[18]C[White's descent here was kind of bewildering. Bad move.]
;B[bg]BL[444]LB[do:A]C[So I decide to turn here now in order to completely seal off White from the left. I'm aiming at A (D5).]
;W[nc]WL[7]C[White approaches while extending from his wall (though it is a little far apart).]
;B[qf]BL[428]C[I decide to calmly respond in preparation for upcoming invasion/fighting.]
;W[pb]WL[595]C[White dives in.]
;B[mc]BL[402]C[And I decide to attach to see what White's intentions are.]
;W[mb]WL[585]C[White hanes under which seems rather passive.]
;B[do]BL[374]C[So I go ahead and tenuki to approach the lower left now since my goal is fast development.]
;W[cm]WL[582]C[White does the one space low pincer again.]
;B[cq]BL[337]C[So I attach to fight again since I have the thickness backing me up on the top.]
;W[cp]WL[579]C[White hanes to separate the Black stones.]
;B[dp]BL[332]C[I cut White to start the fight.]
;W[co]WL[577]C[White extends like before.]
;B[cn]BL[325]C[And then I wedge just like before.]
;W[bn]WL[576]C[White connects underneath.]
;B[dn]BL[320]C[I connect solidly,]
;W[bp]WL[574]C[White protects the same point again.]
;B[eq]BL[309]C[But I'm happy with this development since I'm gaining quite a bit of thickness towards the center.]
;W[dr]WL[542]C[White descends.]
;B[dm]BL[304]C[I extend to threaten to seal White off from the left / center.]
;W[cl]WL[538]C[White extends.]
;B[dl]BL[297]LB[ck:A]C[I extend again to threaten the hane at A (C9).]
;W[ck]WL[533]C[But White extends again.]
;B[er]BL[292]C[And then I'm happy to descend here to make a huge wall for the bottom.]
;W[cr]WL[532]C[White turns to prevent Black from stealing the corner.]
;B[jp]BL[274]C[And now I make a big moyo on the bottom.]
;W[lc]WL[530]C[White chooses to atari here.]
;B[pj]BL[268]C[But the name of my game was fast and big development, I naturally ignored and made the double winged extension.]
;W[mq]WL[508]C[White finally invades, but it's a low and a two space approach, so the normal attacks (i.e. kicks ot iron pilllars) didn't seem too severe.]
;B[pn]BL[218]C[So I chose the calm attack that attacks from afar and temps White to make his group heavy.]
;W[jr]WL[498]C[White dives down to try and make a base.]
;B[jq]BL[555]C[So I try this bump to see how much I can harrass White.]
;W[ir]WL[493]C[White extends out.]
;B[kr]BL[553]C[So I threaten to separate him.]
;W[lr]WL[492]C[This clamp was a great move by White.]
;B[lq]BL[543]C[So I had no choice but to hane here and prepare for bad shape.]
;W[ks]WL[423]C[White connects under.]
;B[kq]BL[542]C[And then I connect in bad shape in order to try to keep harrassing White.]
;W[nr]WL[421]C[White plays the diagonal to expand his eye space.]
;B[pr]BL[535]C[I jump down to start solidifying my corner and restricting his eye space.]
;W[hp]WL[416]C[White tries to jump out to the center.]
;B[gr]BL[531]LB[hq:A]C[This move takes away White's shape (i.e., dog face) and also threatens to cut around A (H3).]
;W[hr]WL[414]C[White bumps my stone while trying to maintain his connection.]
;B[gq]BL[527]C[I stand my stone up to take away his eye shape while threatening to cut again.]
;W[ip]WL[413]C[White makes the bamboo joint.]
;B[jn]BL[517]C[And now I jump out to keep harrassing the group (since it only has one eye tops at the moment).]
;W[hn]WL[404]C[White jumps.]
;B[go]BL[510]C[I peep.]
;W[in]WL[397]C[He makes another bamboo joint.]
;B[jm]BL[486]LB[jo:A]C[I extend solidly because of the weakness of the wedge at A (K5).]
;W[hl]WL[391]C[White jumps again.]
;B[ik]BL[461]LB[jm:A]C[And because of my solid extension at A (K7), I could now do the knight's move to put the most pressure on White.]
;W[il]WL[389]LB[jl:A]C[White makes another bamboo joint while threatening to push out at A (K8).]
;B[jl]BL[460]C[So I block White while happily building the right side moyo to be huge.]
;W[qj]WL[596]C[I was shocked to see White attach here next. After all, he already had one weak group to take care of! Creating another one is a recipe for disaster when playing me.]
;B[hk]BL[449]TR[hl][il][hn][in][hp][ip][mq][hr][ir][jr][lr][nr][ks]C[I decided to ignored because this move would seal White in and possibly kill the entire K2 group (triangle). I didn't think White would have time to take advantage of my tenuki with this attack.]
;W[fl]WL[585]C[White jumps to try and salvage his group.]
;B[gk]BL[446]C[This simple extension removes his shape point and keeps White under pressure.]
;W[fn]WL[577]TR[dl][dm][cn][dn][do][go][dp][eq][gq][er][gr]C[White jumps to try and weaken my E2 group (triangle).]
;B[gm]BL[432]C[Triple-peep to remove eye shape!]
;W[gl]WL[573]C[White blocks on top.]
;B[gn]BL[427]C[So I connect on the botom!]
;W[fm]WL[570]C[White connects.]
;B[fo]BL[420]C[And I turn here to maintain my group's connections so White doesn't come back and kill my group.]
;W[fk]WL[546]C[White pushes out to the center.]
;B[dk]BL[405]C[I extend to prevent White from connecting with his group on the left.]
;W[dj]WL[541]C[White hanes.]
;B[ej]BL[399]C[I counter hane to keep White separated.]
;W[ek]WL[540]TR[dk][dl][dm][gm][cn][dn][gn][do][fo][go][dp][eq][gq][er][gr]C[White cuts and my E2 group (triangle) could potentialy die now.]
;B[fp]BL[364]C[To prevent a capturing race, I decided to take the time to make my group absolutely alive.]
;W[fj]WL[533]C[White ataris while extending out to the center.]
;B[ei]BL[360]C[So I extend.]
;W[di]WL[531]TR[fj][ek][fk][fl][gl][hl][il][fm][fn][hn][in][hp][ip][mq][hr][ir][jr][lr][nr][ks]C[White extends here, but this is the wrong side since it doesn't help his L1 group (triangle).]
;B[eh]BL[346]C[So I extend and get even stronger.]
;W[fi]WL[528]C[White extends, but it's too late now.]
;B[fh]BL[300]C[Black is strong enough to turn and keep pressure on White.]
;W[hi]WL[487]C[White jumps.]
;B[gh]BL[292]C[I remove his shape point while threatening to cut.]
;W[gi]WL[467]LB[hj:A]C[White connects in bad shape, but I don't see why he didn't just make the bamboo joint at A (H10).]
;B[ji]BL[273]LB[jk:A]C[I have a cutting point at A (K9), so I play this knight's move to build the right while protecting is at the same time.]
;W[hh]WL[461]C[White turns to try and escape.]
;B[hg]BL[597]C[I hane to keep White separated.]
;W[jh]WL[458]C[White jumps out here, but this is a mistake.]
;B[ih]BL[587]C[After reading out the variations, I figured that the wedge worked.]
;W[ii]WL[457]C[White ataris from below.]
;B[ig]BL[586]C[I connect.]
;W[jj]WL[457]C[White ataris to try and come out.]
;B[ki]BL[566]C[And I extend. ]
;W[jk]WL[451]TR[gk][hk][ik]C[Oh no! The H9 stones (triangle) are captured! Hunt is over!]
;B[ms]BL[559]C[But if you give it some thought, White cannot make a living shape with those three stones, so with this move, White is still only had one eye. ]
;W[ns]WL[431]C[The hunt is still on!]
;B[ls]BL[546]C[I have to extend to keep White's eye falsified.]
;W[js]WL[428]LB[is:A]C[White connects and threatens to make an eye at A (J1).]
;B[hs]BL[536]C[I destroy it.]
;W[lk]WL[424]C[White jumps out to try and find another eye.]
;B[lm]BL[525]C[I follow suit and give chase!]
;W[jg]WL[418]C[White extends here, but again, this does not help the dying group.]
;B[lj]BL[505]C[So now I can continue adding to my attack and starting to ensure my kill.]
;W[mk]WL[413]C[Whtie extends to try and find some space.]
;B[kk]BL[499]LB[kj:A]C[But this wedge works (because A (L10) is self atari.]
;W[ij]WL[412]C[White connects.]
;B[kj]BL[495]TR[hh][fi][gi][hi][ii][fj][ij][jj][ek][fk][jk][fl][gl][hl][il][fm][fn][hn][in][hp][ip][mq][hr][ir][jr][lr][nr][js][ks][ns]C[But with this connection, the entire White group (triangle) is practically dead.]
;W[oq]WL[406]C[White peeps.]
;B[pq]BL[489]C[I connect solidly.]
;W[np]WL[597]C[White tries to make an eye.]
;B[op]BL[487]LB[mp:A][or:B]C[But with this turn it's miai (A (N4) or B (P2)) to falsify the eye.]
;W[lp]WL[592]C[White tries to get fancy.]
;B[mo]BL[481]C[But this peep destroys his eye potential.]
;W[mp]WL[590]C[White connects.]
;B[or]BL[477]C[So I falsify his eye.]
;W[no]WL[581]C[White extends to try and get out.]
;B[mn]BL[469]C[I extend to keep him sealed in.]
;W[nn]WL[579]C[White continues trying to extend towards the center.]
;B[nm]BL[466]C[But I can hane and keep White sealed in and dead.]
;W[om]WL[575]C[White hanes to try and break out.]
;B[on]BL[452]C[But I can cut with no problem.]
;W[nl]WL[575]C[White ataris to try and complicate things.]
;B[mm]BL[451]LB[kk:2][jl:1][kl:A]C[I connect, but my two groups are connected because White cannot cut at A (L8).]
;W[ol]WL[567]C[White connects, but this doesn't really threaten much.]
;B[lg]BL[398]C[So I jump out here to increase my power in the center and prevent White from trying to start a capturing race (since I can't make two eyes).]
;W[kl]WL[549]C[White tries to cut.]
;B[ll]BL[395]C[But it doesn't work. The cutting stone is now captured.]
;W[ko]WL[549]C[White tries to peep.]
;B[jo]BL[393]C[But "even a moron connects against a peep."]
;W[pk]WL[546]C[White now tries to make life on the right.]
;B[ql]BL[384]C[And though I am safely ahead, I see no reason to take it easy on White. This takes away White's shape point.]
;W[qk]WL[543]C[White connects.]
;B[rl]BL[378]C[So I descend to remove eye potential on the right.]
;W[jf]WL[536]TR[jg][jh]C[White extends here to save his K13 stones (triangle).]
;B[ni]BL[371]TR[qj][lk][mk][pk][qk][nl][ol][om]C[So I go ahead and continue my attack on the P8 group (triangle).]
;W[oj]WL[525]C[White ataris to try and make an eye.]
;B[pi]BL[597]C[I extend.]
;W[oi]WL[524]C[White tries to push through.]
;B[ph]BL[590]LB[oh:A]C[And I extend again because I do not have enough liberties to hane at A (P12).]
;W[oh]WL[523]C[White extends.]
;B[pg]BL[581]C[I extend once more because I don't think White can escape.]
;W[lh]WL[515]C[White tries to cut.]
;B[kh]BL[579]C[I push through.]
;W[kg]WL[511]C[White cuts.]
;B[mh]BL[578]C[I capture the cutting stone.]
;W[mj]WL[510]TR[kh][ji][ki][kj][lj][kk]C[White ataris my L11 group (triangle). ]
;B[km]BL[572]C[I capture.]
;W[mi]WL[504]C[White threatens to connect his stones.]
;B[li]BL[562]C[So I must capture.]
;W[mf]WL[501]LB[nh:A]C[Here White makes another mistake by ignoring his weak group and trying to attack my group.]
;B[nh]BL[558]C[So I connect solidly and remove White chances to make easy life.]
;W[og]WL[494]C[White extends to break out.]
;B[lf]BL[552]TR[jf][jg][kg][jh]C[I extend aiming at the K14 (triangle) stones.]
;W[le]WL[488]C[But White really wants to kill me.]
;B[nf]BL[531]C[No problem. I'll just use this clamp move!]
;W[ng]WL[456]C[White really wants to kill me...]
;B[mg]BL[512]TR[mf]C[So I cut and threaten to capture the N14 stone (triangle).]
;W[me]WL[454]C[White connects.]
;B[of]BL[511]C[And then I seal White in for the final epic battle.]
;W[kf]WL[596]TR[jf][jg][kg][jh]C[White protects his K14 stones (triangle).]
;B[lh]BL[495]LB[nj:A]C[This is a mistake by Black. I was worried about a shortage of liberty, but I could have forced at A (O10) first before connecting.]
;W[nj]WL[593]C[White takes the vital point and makes an eye.]
;B[kl]BL[494]C[I have to connect. And now I am in an epic capturing race.]
;W[lo]WL[586]C[White removes my potential for a real eye.]
;B[pl]BL[491]LB[ok:A]C[And so I extend thinking White will respond at A (P9) to make an eye.]
;W[rh]WL[579]C[White jumps to try and increase his liberties.]
;B[ok]BL[474]C[But this throw-in tesuji is a killer when it comes to reducing liberties.]
;W[qi]WL[571]C[White extends to try and increase his liberties.]
;B[rg]BL[453]C[I kick White to him from running anymore.]
;W[qh]WL[567]C[White tries to make eye shape.]
;B[qg]BL[449]C[But this only induces Black to continue removing liberties (which is not what you want in a capturing race).]
;W[rk]WL[566]C[White tries to make an eye.]
;B[ml]BL[439]C[But I'm pretty sure I'm ahead in liberties now, so I execute the throw-in tesuji.]
;W[nk]WL[565]C[White has to connect.]
;B[pm]BL[439]C[Now I can atari and remove another another liberty.]
;W[ok]WL[565]C[White has to connect.]
;B[sj]BL[430]C[And now with this jump I've destroyed his eye.]
;W[sk]WL[562]C[White can try to cut me off.]
;B[sh]BL[420]C[But I have this jump and White is uber dead.

White resigns. Estimated score: Black +137 points. Epic pwnage!])
