;B[qd]C[During this challenge, I tried to open with the 3-4 as much as I could as Black to get myself out of the moyo mindset.]
;W[dp]C[White avoids the cross-fuseki with this move, but it doesn't take advantage of Black's declaration to emphasize the right side and thus expose a weak top side.]
;B[pq]C[Alternating 3-4 seemed appropriate since the star point in the lower left would give me an easy approach that would work well with my Q3 stone.]
;W[dc]LB[oc:A][fq:B]C[White chooses the 3-4 where its strong side faces my 3-4's weak side (in the upper right). 

I had two choices: (1) Enclose the corner with a move like A (P17) or (2) Approach with B (F3).]
;B[fq]C[As I've come to learn more of my style, I've realized I prefer faster development, so the approach was natural for me.]
;W[ci]C[White chooses to setup the low Chinese opening, which surprised me a bit. ]
;B[oc]C[I had responded on the botttom, I had a strong feeling White would approach the upper right in an effort to make a big moyo. 

As someone who has studied the Chinese Opening quite a bit, I knew that fighting and using the Chinese formation was the key to its victory, so I decided to enclose the corner in the upper right to limit White's potential and not play to White's desires.

]
;W[hq]C[White decides on the one-space pincer.]
;B[cq]C[Keeping with the idea of being calm, I decided to take the 3-3 invasion and expected to gain sente so that I could start restricting White's potential with his Chinese formation.]
;W[dq]C[Much to my surprise, White blocks the wrong direction.]
;B[cp]C[So I extend like I'm supposed to (in the joseki) while being happy knowing that White's Chinese formation is already damaged.]
;W[co]C[And then White hanes as if it were a typical 3-3 invasion, but this is wrong. Oh how I was so thrilled to get a mistake so early in the game during a tournament.]
;B[cr]TR[fq]C[This is the proper refutation to the hane when Black has the F3 stone (triangle) present.]
;W[dr]C[White blocks as expected.]
;B[do]TR[dp][dq][dr]SQ[co]C[But this cut is very painful. Black will either capture the D2 stones (triangle) or C5 (square).]
;W[eo]C[White decides to save the bigger group.]
;B[dn]C[So I extend.]
;W[fp]C[White protects his cutting point with the tiger's mouth.]
;B[cn]C[And I firmly turn to gain a very nice corner while also damaging White's left potential.]
;W[cl]C[White then extends two spaces to try and limit my thickness, but this is slow. Black now has sente.]
;B[qj]C[Since White did not split my right side, I decided to go ahead and take the big point myself.]
;W[qo]LB[jc:A][oj:C][mq:B]C[I was expecting something along the lines of A (K17), B (N3) or C (P10), but then White invades at the perfect area for me to attack. Needless to say I'm thrilled.]
;B[qm]LB[qp:A]C[To be honest, I'm shocked I played here. It's a nice pincer and two space extension, but I don't know why the hell I did not kick him at A (R4). *hangs head in shame*]
;W[oo]C[White jumps.]
;B[np]C[I attack with the knight's move.]
;W[no]C[White extends.]
;B[mp]C[I stretch as well.]
;W[rq]C[Then White dives for the corner for some kind of base.]
;B[jq]LB[fq:A]C[And I decide to establish my own base here while aiming at potential aji of the A (F3) stone and negating White's thickness on the bottom.]
;W[qh]C[White now tries to pincer! How aggressive!]
;B[oi]C[I decide to attack the stone in response.]
;W[qk]LB[qh:A][qo:B]C[White then plays this really nice attachment. It works in this scenario because White has supporting stones at both A (R12) and B (R5).]
;B[ql]C[So I choose to clamp and see how White responds.]
;W[rj]C[White decides to hane towards his R12 stone.]
;B[pk]C[So I make the atari.]
;W[rk]C[He connects.]
;B[pj]LB[pl:A]C[And then I connect solidly. 

Question: Do you think White can cut at A (P8)? If so, click on it to find out the answer!]
(;W[pe]C[White now tries to make some shape.]
;B[rf]C[I decide to slide under to limit White's eyespace as much as possible.]
;W[rg]C[White kicks and tries to preserve his eye space.]
;B[qf]C[I stand up to keep pressure on White.]
;W[om]LB[pl:A]C[White plays on the shape point and threatens to cut at A (Q8).]
;B[ol]C[Tiger's mouth to protect the connection.]
;W[rn]C[Kosumi (i.e., diagonal) that threatens to connect the two groups.]
;B[rl]LB[ri:A]TR[rj][qk][rk]C[The empty triangle is the best shape to keep White cut off while also removing a liberty from the group and threatening the hane at A (S11) which would capture the S10 group (triangle).]
;W[ri]C[White protects his stones.]
;B[sh]C[I then play on the vital point to keep White at one eye and weak so that I can keep chasing it.]
;W[oh]C[White attaches to try and gain some shape.]
;B[og]LB[ph:A]C[Clamp that threatens the cut at A (Q12).]
;W[pg]C[White continues trying to escape.]
;B[nh]C[Atari to strengthen my own group while keeping White on the run.]
;W[pf]C[White connects to gain some breathing space ]
;B[ph]LB[qg:A]C[I capture the stone in order to ensure my own group is strong while aiming to cut at A (R13).]
;W[qe]LB[re:B][qg:A]C[However, I was not anticipating this push. This is a great way for White to indirectly defend against the cut at A (R13). If Black tries to cut, he will be captured with B (S15).]
;B[re]LB[qg:A]C[So naturally I have to retreat while still aiming for the cut at A (R13).]
;W[pd]LB[qg:A]C[White then tries to continue running while defending the cutting point, but technically Black could cut now. Click on A (R13) to see what I mean.]
(;B[pc]C[I wanted to protect the corner territory, so I blocked.]
;W[sl]C[White threatens to connect.]
;B[sm]C[Block.]
;W[sk]C[Connects.]
;B[rm]C[Repairs the cutting point by connecting.]
;W[sg]C[White then threatens to make life.]
;B[rc]LB[qg:A]C[I start my defending my corner and once again threatening to cut at A (R13).]
;W[qg]C[White finally connects.]
(;B[si]C[And then I decide to remove White's secont eye and go for the kill. This is nearly my game losing move. To see what I should have done, go back to Move 64 and click on O15.]
;W[me]C[When I saw White try to make a two spaced jump, I decided to try and punish it immediately.]
;B[ne]C[I attach and you can start to see my calm game start to unravel.]
;W[nf]C[White hanes to threaten to connect.]
;B[of]C[I push and cut.]
;W[nd]C[White ataris from the top.]
;B[oe]C[I connect.]
;W[od]C[White connects.]
;B[md]C[And then I cut. As you can see, it's obvious I'm going for the kill now. Harrassing the group isn't even an option.]
;W[mc]C[White ataris from the correct direction.]
;B[ld]C[I must extend to keep White at one eye.]
;W[nc]C[White repairs his cutting point.]
;B[lc]C[And with this turn, I think I had him in the bag.]
;W[lb]C[White hanes to try and make eye shape.]
;B[kb]C[I block, but I'm starting to get a feeling that I may have been completely wrong...]
;W[ob]C[White hanes again, and I notice my corner group is getting REALLY weak.]
;B[pb]LB[ma:A][na:B]C[And with this block, I was prepared to White to live with A (N19) or B (O19).]
;W[nb]C[But then he plays the solid connection!]
;B[la]C[Seeing a chance to still kill the entire group, I leap at the opportunity to start a ko. However, it may have been premature of me to do so ince I did not have very many ko threats.]
;W[ma]C[White sets up the ko shape.]
;B[mb]C[And I take the ko first.]
;W[ng]TR[ne][oe][of][og]C[White puts the P15 stones (triangle) in atari.]
;B[oh]C[Have to connect.]
;W[lb]C[White takes the ko.]
;B[rp]C[I threaten to weaken the bottom group.]
;W[qp]C[He responds and keeps them connected.]
;B[mb]C[Take the ko again.]
;W[pm]LB[pl:A]C[Threatens to cut at A (Q8).]
;B[pl]C[Connects.]
;W[lb]C[Takes the ko.]
;B[qq]C[Cut to continue attacking the entire group.]
;W[sp]C[White ataris to keep his group connected.]
;B[mb]C[Take the ko.]
;W[sd]LB[rd:A]C[White threatens the cut at A (S16), and at this point I realized I may be in more trouble than I bargained for. Ah... the woes of trying to kill something...]
;B[rd]C[Connect.]
;W[lb]C[Takes the ko.]
;B[pp]C[Threaten to cut White into two groups with A (Q5) and B (R6). Though in reailty, it's a ko threat that could be ignored when you consider how big this fight is.]
;W[po]C[White connects anyways however, because though I didn't know it at the time, he had plenty of ko threats up his sleeve.]
;B[mb]C[Takes the ko.]
;W[qb]LB[qc:A]TR[pb][oc][pc]C[Remember what I said about my opponent having a bunch of ko threats? My corner is in trouble... sigh.

White threatens to cut at A (R17) and capture the Q18 stones (triangle).

]
;B[qa]C[Hane to try and minimize the number of White's ko threats.]
;W[lb]C[Takes the ko.]
;B[rr]C[Threatens to steal White's base; but again, this is small compared to the ongoing ko fight.]
;W[ro]C[White captures and secures his group.]
;B[mb]C[Takes the ko.]
;W[rb]LB[qc:A]C[White's extension here once again threatens the atari and cut at A (R17).]
;B[pa]C[Connect to prevent the cut.]
;W[lb]C[Takes the ko.]
;B[sn]C[Threaten to falsify White's eye.]
;W[so]C[It was a very weak threat, but White was very confident in his ability to win the ko and responded anyways.]
;B[mb]TR[sp]C[Takes the ko.]
;W[sb]C[White extends and threatens to kill my entire corner. 

If you can't see it, click on M18.]
(;B[sc]C[Cut to make my second eye, but I fail to see the weakness with this move (which you'll see shortly).]
;W[lb]C[White takes the ko.]
;B[sr]C[Threatens to falsify White's eye again.]
;W[sq]C[White responds again, but the ko threat was very weak.]
;B[mb]C[I take the ko hoping somehow to make this work.]
;W[sf]LB[se:A]TR[sd]C[And with this extension, I realize I'm in big trouble. 

If you think you can capture the T16 stone (triangle) with A (T15), click on A (T15).]
(;B[qc]C[So connecting is the only option, but I'm guessing you can see it now too can't you?]
;W[se]C[White connects.]
;B[ra]C[And Black is left with dead eye shape.]
;W[oa]C[White ataris.]
;B[sa]C[Black captures.]
;W[rb]TR[pa][qa][ra][sa][pb][oc][pc][qc][rc][sc][qd][rd][re][qf][rf]C[And then White kills the group. 

You might wonder why I did this, but I wanted to possibly use the aji of the Q19 stones (triangle) later on. After all, if you'll notice, White is still not alive and needs two moves to capture Black. That is certainly a prime candidate for aji later on. ]
;B[ln]TR[om][pm][rn][no][oo][po][qo][ro][so][qp][sp][rq][sq]C[With my corner dead, I knew I had taken an advantageous position and turned made myself behidn instead. At this point, I needed to find a way to aggressively catch up and hopefully make use of the power I had in the center. 

So I started with this knight's move and threaten to start attacking the T3 group (triangle).]
;W[mm]C[White defends his group with a nice one point jump and renders his entire group alive (aka short of White letting Black play two moves, White is definitely alive and can no longer be attacked).]
;B[gq]LB[hr:A]C[I bump here thinking I can connect via A (H2).]
;W[hp]C[Except I didn't consider White's response here. Whoops.]
;B[de]C[Time to approach the upperl left corner.]
;W[ce]C[White chooses to attach! Sweet.]
;B[dd]C[Since I want to use my influence on the right, the descent here is the correct joseki choice.]
;W[cc]LB[ec:B][cd:A]C[White normally bock at A (C16) which iw then followed up by Black B (E17), but White chose this rather odd move.]
;B[cd]C[I decided to push through White's weakness to punish his mistake.]
;W[gc]C[White surprisingly ignores and establishes a base on top.]
;B[cg]TR[ci][cl]C[So I switched my attention to the left side and aimed to settle while keeping my eye on the C8 group (triangle).]
;W[cf]C[White bumps and threatens to split Black into two groups.]
;B[df]C[Blocking is absolutely essential.]
;W[bg]C[White now threatens to connect his stones together.]
;B[bf]C[But I was ready for that with this sacrifice tactic.]
;W[be]C[White has to capture the cutting stone.]
;B[bh]C[But now I can block here in sente.]
;W[af]C[White must capture.]
;B[ch]C[And I can connect and keep the White groups separated.]
;W[bi]C[White descents and threatens to connect under.]
;B[ah]LB[bd:A]TR[be][ce][af][cf][bg]C[Solid descent to cut apart the White groups and threatens to kill the B15 group (triangle) with A (B16).]
;W[bd]C[White extends and saves his group.]
;B[el]C[So now I embark on attacking (and hopefully killing this group since I feel like I'm really behind).]
;W[dg]C[White surprisingly chooses to cut.]
;B[dh]C[I decide to employ another sacrifice tactic in trying to make a large center.]
;W[eg]C[White extends.]
;B[eh]C[I keep pressure on White.]
;W[ff]TR[cd][dd][de][df]C[White plays the kosumi (i.e.. diagonal) and aims to capture the D16 stones (triangle).]
;B[fg]C[I was prepared to sacrifice them already, so the atari here was only natural since I'm trying to maximize the center.]
;W[ef]C[White connects.]
;B[gf]LB[fe:A]C[Double hane to threaten A (F15).]
;W[gg]C[White cuts and ataris first.]
;B[fh]C[Black connects.]
;W[ge]C[White ataris.]
;B[hf]C[I extend.]
;W[ed]C[And White repairs his weakness.]
;B[lk]C[And now I try to surrounas big a center as possible.]
;W[lm]C[White extends to begin his reduction on my center.]
;B[jl]LB[km:A]C[I know that I cannot block directly at A (L6) due to too many cutting points, so a move like this seemed more appropriate for surrounding the center.]
;W[mk]C[White attaches to continue reducing my center.]
;B[nl]LB[ml:A]C[Double peep that threatens to cut at A (N8).]
;W[ml]C[White connects in bad shape.]
;B[nm]C[But now I can aim to attack this group since I can attack his eye space now.]
;W[mn]C[White chooses to keep the whole group connected.]
;B[nn]C[So I descend and remove his second eye, which renders the white group vulnerable to attack (and possible but unlikely death).]
;W[mo]C[White connects.]
;B[lp]C[I extend solidly here to prevent White from (1) gaining any forcing moves against the bottom (which would be useful for gaining eyes) and (2) further solidifying my bottom territory.]
;W[lj]TR[lk]C[White hanes and threatens to capture the M9 stone (triangle).]
;B[kk]C[Extend to keep white at one eye.]
;W[mi]C[White makes a tiger mouth to continue trying to make eye shape.

Question: Since White wants to save his whole group, what's the most obvious forcing move for Black?]
;B[nj]TR[ne][oe][of][og][nh][oh][ph][oi][pj][qj][pk][nl][ol][pl][ql][rl][nm][qm][rm][sm][nn][sn]C[Correct. This peep helps gain some eyeshape for Black (since if you notice the P15 group (triangle) is almost cut off).]
;W[mj]C[White connects as expected.]
;B[jn]C[I see some weakness in this area and dod not want White connecting to the lower left group, so I reinforce this area with a one point jump.]
;W[ji]C[White's knight move give him some shape in the center.]
;B[kh]C[I play on a shape point to continue keeping White at one eye.]
;W[mh]TR[ne][oe][of][og][nh][oh][ph][oi][nj][pj][qj][pk][nl][ol][pl][ql][rl][nm][qm][rm][sm][nn][sn]C[White now threatens to permanently cut off the P15 group (triangle).]
;B[qi]LB[mf:A]C[Though the double atari exists at A (N14), I decided to try and feint making life in hopes that Black will see it as a gote move. In reality though, there exists a huge implication with this move. 

Question: Can you see why I played here?]
;W[kg]LB[mf:A][nk:B]C[Thank my lucky stars. White turns his attention to securing his own group since he sees that Black has a miai for life (A (N14) and B (O9)).]
;B[na]C[Answer to Move 185's Question: This is the reason. White cannot connect at A (S12) since it would be self-atari. ]
;W[bo]C[White threatens to take the kill the corner, but there is honestly nothing as large as this ko fight on the board.]
;B[rh]C[With that, Black takes a commanding lead. And that, my friends, is why leaving aji (i.e., like the way I did in the upper right corner) is so important.]
;W[bp]C[White now has to make good on his threat to take the corner.]
;B[bn]C[I am happy to give him the corner, because I had read this out and knew he would end in gote. You'll see shortly.]
;W[bq]C[White must extend to win the capturing race.]
;B[br]C[Though this looks like I am adding stones to a dead group, this is part of the sacrifice strategy to keep sente and also seal off the left side at the same time.]
;W[ar]C[White must hane to stay ahead in the capturing race.]
;B[ao]C[Black makes one more forcing move to seal off the left side.]
;W[cs]C[White must add one more stone to take the corner, so Black ends in sente. Neat right?]
;B[en]C[Now that I'm ahead, I calmly extend to keep good shape and maintain my lead.]
;W[fn]C[White blocks.]
;B[fm]C[And then I hane with good shape.]
;W[he]LB[if:A]C[White extends and threatens the atari at A (J14).]
;B[if]TR[mh][mi][lj][mj][mk][ml][lm][mm][om][pm][mn][rn][mo][no][oo][po][qo][ro][so][qp][sp][rq][sq]C[I extend to prevent White's forcing move and continue to have my eye on the N12 group (triangle) since it's not quite alive yet.]
;W[ej]C[White tries to live, but much too late.]
;B[gj]C[I seal White in with this cap.]
;W[bm]C[White plays the kosumi to try and make eye shape.]
;B[dk]C[But I am so strong in the area that I can simply play this diagonal to keep reducing White's eye space.]
;W[bk]C[White starts making his eyes.]
;B[cj]C[But I keep reducing his eye space.]
;W[al]LB[an:A]C[White makes a half-eye and threatens to start a ko with A (A6).]
;B[an]C[So I connect since I am sure I can kill him.]
;W[bj]LB[ak:A]C[White now makes one eye at A (A9) by connecting here.

Question: What is the firmest way to kill White?]
;B[ck]LB[am:A][cm:B]C[Though an empty triangle, this is the best way since it leaves Black a miai of A (A7) and B (C7) and doesn't give White any forcing moves (i.e., atari).]
;W[hh]TR[gf][hf][if]C[White now aims to try and capture the J14 stones (triangle).]
;B[gh]C[Atari to keep my own shape strong.]
;W[hg]C[White connects.]
;B[hi]LB[ih:A]C[Bulge out and threaten the atari at A (J13).]
;W[ih]C[White must extend in bad shape to escape.]
;B[ii]LB[jh:A]C[Another forcing move (that threatens A (K12)) to continue solidifying my territory.]
;W[jh]C[White connects.]
;B[je]LB[hb:C][gn:B][ir:A]C[Now I escape with my stones, but in hindsight, this was rather small. There are much bigger endgames lik A (J2), B (G6) and C (H18).]
;W[jf]LB[ie:A]C[White threatens to cut at A (J15).]
;B[ie]LB[ir:A]C[So I connect.]
;W[ke]C[White blocks.]
;B[hb]C[I try to play a more efficient move to reduce White's top side.]
;W[ic]LB[hb:A][je:B]C[But White plays a great move here that threatens to either capture my A (H18) stone or my B (K15) group.]
;B[ib]C[I decide that I can compensate for the loss with reducing, so I save the top.]
;W[jd]TR[ie][je][gf][hf][if]C[White now takes the J15 group (triangle).]
;B[hd]LB[fe:A]C[But there is plenty of aji left! With this move, I am looking to exploit the double atari at A (F15).]
;W[id]C[After White cuts here, I realize the double atari doesn't quite work.]
;B[gd]LB[hc:A]C[I choose the atari here, but this is a slight overplay since White can actually cut at A (H17). 

Click on A (H17) if you want to see a potential variation.]
(;W[ig]C[White thankfully captures.]
;B[hc]C[So I connect and can severely reduce his top.]
;W[gb]C[White blocks the potential monkey jump.]
;B[ga]C[So I hane to reduce the top.]
;W[eb]C[And then White plays this nice one point jump.]
;B[ir]TR[fq][gq]C[So now I return to the bottom for bigger endgame. This move threatens to save the G3 stones (triangle).]
;W[hr]C[White blocks.]
;B[hs]C[Hane under to further reducing White.]
;W[iq]LB[jr:A]C[White blocks on top first ot threaten A (K2).]
;B[jr]C[I repair my cutting point.]
;W[jp]LB[kq:A]C[White's hane here scared me at the time since I was worried about White A (L3).]
(;B[kp]LB[gr:A]C[So I blocked here, but in fact I could have actually played A (G2). Go back to Move 240 and click on G2 to see what I mean.]
;W[gs]C[So White now blocks the bottom.]
;B[jo]C[Since it would be gote to block, I took the atari here to keep the initiative.]
;W[ip]C[White connects.]
;B[gn]C[Another atari that also expands my center.]
;W[fo]C[White connects.]
;B[go]TR[fq][gq]C[Extend and threaten to save the G3 stones (triangle).]
;W[gp]C[White blocks.]
;B[ap]C[Atari to force White to capture (thus giving him one less point).]
;W[bs]C[White captures.]
;B[fd]LB[fb:A]C[Extend and threaten the atari at A (F18).]
;W[fc]C[Block.]
;B[fe]TR[cd][dd][de][df]C[Extend and threaten to save the D16 stones (triangle).]
;W[ee]C[White captures.]
(;B[jc]C[And though this seems small, this is very important to reatining Black's points on the top. If you can't see what I mean, go back to Move 254 and click J1.]
;W[is]C[White captures the stone on the bottom.]
;B[js]C[Black blocks.]
;W[jm]C[White wedges to try and reduce Black's center territory.]
;B[im]C[There was no need to be greedy here, so I atari'd from the outside.]
;W[jk]C[White tries to get fancy with this clamp.]
;B[ik]C[Again, no need to be greed, atari from the outside was the safest move since I wanted to simply end the game.]
;W[kl]C[White tries to be fancy with thie atari.]
;B[jj]C[But the simple capture here rendered his moves moot.]
;W[gm]TR[gn][go]C[White cuts and hopes to capture the G6 (triangle) ]
;B[gl]C[But there are two ladders for Black to choose from, click on A (H7) to see what I mean.]
(;W[op]C[White pushes to reduce the bottom.]
;B[oq]C[Black blocks.]
;W[km]TR[jm]C[White saves his K7 stone (triangle) from being captured.]
;B[mf]C[Double atari was the biggest move I could find at this time.]
;W[mg]C[White saves the bigger group (aka the two stones).]
;B[le]C[Captures the other stone.]
;W[ko]C[White jumps and cuts off my bottom group from the center.]
;B[lr]C[I panicked at the time because I saw some cutting aji. Because I was so tired, I was unable to read them out properly and simply protected since I was pretty sure I was ahead.]
;W[kn]C[White now plays his own double atari.]
;B[in]C[I save the two stones.]
;W[lf]C[White ataris, but this is a ko stone and worth a half point at most.]
;B[ea]C[So I ignore to further reduce White's top with this one point jump.]
;W[da]C[White blocks.]
;B[kj]LB[jk:A]TR[kh]C[I connect to gain a point at A (K9) and threaten to connect to L12 (triangle).]
;W[ki]C[White blocks.]
;B[fa]C[I now return to connect.]
;W[fb]C[White ataris.]
;B[ha]C[I connect.]
;W[hn]C[White ataris.]
;B[hm]C[I capture.]
;W[ho]C[White ataris again, but because this is two stones where I can capture back...]
;B[lo]C[I save my stone here first.]
;W[gm]C[White captures.]
;B[gn]C[But I capture back, so the two stones are not worth the 4 points they typically are worth.]
;W[hs]C[White connects.]
;B[kd]LB[kc:A]C[I gain another point at A (L17).]
;W[nk]C[White reduces.]
;B[ag]C[I reduce and threaten to start a ko.]
;W[bf]C[White connects.]
;B[on]C[I atari.]
;W[pn]C[White connects.]
;B[ok]LB[ni:A]C[I connect and threaten to make another point with A (O11).]
;W[ni]C[White prevents that and threatens to start a ko.]
;B[oj]C[I go ahead and connect since I don't see much else around the board.]
;W[go]C[White threatens to start a ko here.]
;B[gm]C[I connect.]
;W[me]C[White captures and start a ko fight.]
;B[ie]C[To be honest, I should have just let White win, but I decided to try and fight it by starting with this atari.]
;W[je]C[White connects.]
;B[mf]C[Take back the ko.]
;W[dl]LB[ek:A]C[Threatens to atari at A (E9) and save the entire group.]
;B[ek]C[Connect solidly.]
;W[me]C[Takes the ko.]
;B[hf]C[Atari again.]
;W[if]C[Capture.]
;B[mf]C[Take the ko.]
;W[cm]LB[aq:A]C[And then when White plays here, belive it or not, due to my tiredness, I thought the A (A3) liberty was already filled; so I thought that White had found a way to make life. 

To see how White would have lived in my mind, click on A3.]
(;B[em]C[So out of delusional fear, I connect because I thought there was snapback.]
;W[am]C[White gets to live. Crap. There goes about 26 points down the drain.]
;B[ai]C[I push and threaten to kill White by destroying his second eye.]
;W[aj]C[White makes life.]
;B[di]C[And then I block to prevent White from reducing my territory anymore. ]
;W[me]C[White takes the ko, but I have to say I was pretty blown at this point. I wasn't sure if I was winning anymore.]
;B[ca]C[Atari on top.]
;W[db]C[Connects.]
;B[mf]C[Takes the ko.]
;W[qr]LB[rs:A]C[White cuts and threatens A (S1).]
;B[qs]C[I protect.]
;W[me]C[White takes the ko.]
;B[qn]C[And I cannot find anymore ko threats, so I play a dame point.]
;W[mf]C[White wins the ko, which was originally supposed to only be worth half a point and ended up gaining him 26 points or so. Uber fail by Black.]
;B[io]C[Dame.]
;W[ll]C[Dame.]
;B[dm]C[Dame.]

To my utter relief, even though the C11 group (triangle) managed to live, I was still able to win by 33.5 points. Whew...])
(;B[aq]C[So let me take this move to fill the liberty first.]
;W[]C[White will pass so that it's Black's turn again.]
;B[am]LB[em:A]C[And so this is what I saw in my head. If Black tries to falsify White's eye, there is the snapback at A (E7). Too bad this was entirely a figment of my imagination though. Haha.]))
(;W[hm]LB[hl:A][hn:B]TR[gn][go]C[White can extend and Black has two choices: A (H7) and B (H5). 

A (H7) definitely captures the G5 stones (triangle), but Black will choose B (H5) instead.]))
(;B[is]C[If we assume Black comes back to save his stone from being captured.]
;W[jb]C[White can wedge here.]
;B[ja]C[Black can connect under.]
;W[jc]C[White will connect.]
;B[ia]C[And then Black must connect and you can see that there are no points on top for Black.]))
(;B[gr]C[Now I save the stones here.]
;W[kq]C[White can hane here to try and reduce Black's bottom.]
;B[kp]C[Black can actually still cut believe it or not.]
;W[kr]C[White can descend to try and start a capturing race.]
;B[is]TR[fq][gq][gr]C[But with this connection, my reading tells me that White cannot win the capturing race because of Black's G3 stones (triangle) which provide quite a few liberties.]))
(;W[hc]C[White cuts.]
;B[fe]C[I capture.]
;W[ee]C[White will need to capture now.]
;B[fc]LB[gd:A]C[But since Black is cut off, the most he can do it try to utilize the aji of the stones to maybe reduce the top, but again it doesn't look that great for Black. Hence why A (G16) is an overplay.]))
(;B[se]C[It looks like Black is good now right? That's an eye!]
;W[qc]C[Oh wait. This cut works and Black is just dead now. Whomp whomp whomp....]))
(;B[lb]C[So you think the corner is safe?]
;W[sf]C[What about White's extension here?]
;B[sc]C[The best Black can do it cut here.]
;W[se]C[White will connect and put Black in atari.]
;B[qc]C[Black will have to connect.]
;W[oa]C[And then White will atari and it's all over.]))
(;B[ne]C[By playing here first, I and threatening to kill White's entire group.]
;W[si]C[White can't let his entire group die and must live in gote.]
;B[hc]C[But with so much outside thickness, Black can now take sente to make a big extension to gain a lot on the top. This would have been the calmer way.]))
(;B[qg]C[If Black cuts now.]
;W[rd]C[White can try to atari here first.]
;B[rh]C[But Black can ignore and cut here.]
;W[qi]C[White will need to connect here to start some sort of capturing race.]
;B[sg]C[Black will then capture threatening to make life.]
;W[qc]C[And then White will take the corner with this move. This is technically an ption for Black, but considering that the corner was Black's originally, this is a loss for Black.]))
(;W[pl]C[So you think White can cut eh? ]
;B[om]C[I bet you were anticipating a ladder!]
;W[ol]C[But no matter how White runs.]
;B[nl]C[Block.]
;W[ok]C[Run.]
;B[nk]C[Block.]
;W[oj]C[Run.]
;B[nj]C[It is futile! Therefore, White cannot cut!]))
