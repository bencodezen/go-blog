;B[pe]BL[895.533]C[5-4 opening. Don't see this very often, but it emphasizes the right side.]
;W[dd]WL[892.187]C[Star point to simplify things from my end.]
;B[pq]BL[891.407]C[3-4 komoku that emphasizes the bottom.]
;W[eq]WL[882.739]C[I have more experience with 5-3 then 5-4, so I play here to limit Black's growth potential on the bottom.]
;B[jj]BL[888.934]C[Tengen next move is a little unusual, but I was not surprised when I thought about who my opponent was.]
;W[qo]WL[860.772]LB[po:A]C[I decide to approach low since my goal is to settle as quickly as possible. If I approached on the 4th line instead (like at A (Q4)), then I would give Black an opportunity to try and use the tengen stone by starting a fight or something.]
;B[oo]BL[869.921]C[This knight's move seemed a little weird to me since it looks like a reverse shimari, but I guess Black was trying to build influence with this move.]
;W[ql]WL[825.193]LB[qq:A]C[I try to avoid getting sealed in whenever I can, so taking the two space extension here was a no brainer. since the attachment at A (R3) is still open later on if needed. ]
;B[ol]BL[857.918]LB[qi:B][qq:A]C[White keeps me down and gains some influence, but since I have a miai of A (R3) and B (R11), I felt I could ignore Black.]
;W[jq]WL[794.429]C[So I chose this extension on the bottom to prevent Black from gaining too much from his influence. And though it's not an ideal five space extension, this was the safest I felt I could go without letting Black invade and try to start a fight where he use his influence.]
;B[cf]BL[844.184]LB[fc:A]C[Black approaches from the left side, but it feels like the other direction at A (F17) would work better with Black's stones overall.]
;W[fc]WL[788.489]C[I take a calm approach since Black has intentions of starting a fight and is trying to make use of the tengen stone.]
;B[bd]BL[838.217]C[Black dives to establish a base.]
;W[cp]WL[760.625]LB[cc:A][ic:B]C[But since White has miai to settle (i.e., A (C17) and B (J17)), I tenukid's and took this corner enclosure to make sure Black can't get a huge left side.]
;B[ci]BL[815.288]C[Black extends two spaces to settle.]
;W[cc]WL[753.234]LB[cl:A]C[I decided to defend the corner, but in hindsight, I think A (C8) would have been better since White still had a miai on top for settling.]
;B[cl]BL[810.25]C[Black takes another two space extension and while also negating some of White's shimari's power in the lower left.]
;W[pc]WL[744.85]C[Approach the upper right corner with intentions of settling quickly.]
;B[oc]BL[798.84]C[Outside attachment is a new joseki for me. Not very familiar with it, but once again you can see Black has intentions of getting influence and making a huge moyo.]
;W[ob]WL[727.724]C[Hane to begin settling my stones.]
;B[nc]BL[795.504]C[Black extends to the left to keep White pressed down and sealed from the center.]
;W[pd]WL[713.194]C[White bumps to threaten to break out into the center while expanding his territory in the corner.]
;B[oe]BL[787.175]C[Black extends to keep all the stones connected.]
;W[re]WL[710.019]C[And then White jumps to the shape point to maximize his corner territory.]
;B[qe]BL[775.227]C[Black bumps once to prevent White from getting an overly large corner.]
;W[rd]WL[700.263]C[White pulls back to keep his stones firmly connected.]
;B[rf]BL[770.721]TR[oe][pe][qe]C[And then Black seals White in, but now that Black has an impending wall (triangle), White needs to do something about it.]
;W[qi]WL[681.409]C[The two-space extension not only negates the wall's power but also stabilizes White's group much more.]
;B[qb]BL[760.197]C[Black jumps in to see if a kill is possible. (This is very common of Black to play things out and try trick plays).]
;W[pb]WL[668.571]C[Have to connect to prevent Black from cutting and killing the entire group.]
;B[qd]BL[752.113]C[Black pushes and threatens to connect.]
;W[qc]WL[666.407]C[White cuts.]
;B[rb]BL[750.995]C[Black extends while threatening to cut.]
;W[rc]WL[658.236]C[White connects solidly, and I can see from this point that White will not die. ]
;B[nb]BL[744.287]C[Black seals White from the top side.]
;W[sb]WL[653.928]C[And then White has to play this hane to live.]
;B[qk]BL[721.603]C[Black attaches to try and press White down.]
;W[rk]WL[635.723]C[Hane to keep White's stones connected.]
;B[qj]BL[715.755]C[Extend while threatening to cut.]
;W[rj]WL[634.138]C[Extend to keep stones connected.]
;B[pl]BL[704.021]C[Bump to keep White sealed from the center.]
;W[qm]WL[624.856]C[Extend to maximize territory while continuing to stabilize the group.]
;B[hq]BL[698.964]TR[ol][oo][pq]C[Black invades to try and make use of the power along P5 (triangle).]
;W[io]WL[610.403]C[I notice I am weak, but I start with the attacking knight's move to see how Black responds.]
;B[gp]BL[684.944]C[Black plays the kosumi (i.e., diagonal) to escape.]
;W[mq]WL[608.046]LB[op:A]C[So I take my two space extension and settle a base for myself while aiming for a potential cut around A (P4) later on.]
;B[po]BL[660.621]C[Black sees the weakness and protects the connection.]
;W[qp]WL[592.248]LB[pp:A]C[I extend to take the shape point and aking more territory while also threatening the push and cut at A (Q4).]
;B[nq]BL[649.345]C[With Black's attachment here, I had to decide how I was going to handle the situation since my group was weak.]
(;W[nr]WL[553.907]LB[np:A]C[Though it might have been better to hane at A (O4) instead, I decided to hane below at this point because I didnt' want my group to becoming a floating one. To see what I mean, go back to Move 49 and click on O4.]
;B[np]BL[628.166]C[Black extends to prevent White from getting the atari forcing move.]
;W[lo]WL[529.671]C[Jump with the knight's move for eye shape and to also gain some access into the center.]
;B[gn]BL[615.053]TR[gp][hq]C[Black runs into the center to prevent White from ahrrassing the H3 group (triangle).]
;W[ic]WL[498.161]C[Since I'm realtively stable around the board, I took the two space extension on top to prevent Black from getting a big extension on the top.]
;B[kc]BL[598.05]C[Black extends here but you can see that Black is rather overconcentrated.]
;W[od]WL[490.523]C[And since I'm stable around the board, I decided that I was read to push and cut to fight.]
;B[nd]BL[593.679]C[Black blocks.]
;W[ne]WL[489.599]C[And then I cut at planned.]
;B[nf]BL[589.771]C[Black ataris.]
;W[me]WL[485.264]TR[nb][kc][nc][oc][nd]C[I extend and now the O18 group (triangle) is cut off and could potentially get attacked.]
;B[mf]BL[583.685]C[Black keeps pressure on White.]
;W[le]WL[480.774]C[Extends to increase liberties and keep Black cut off.]
;B[jd]BL[580.926]C[Black plays the diagonal to escape.]
;W[lf]WL[469.581]C[Now I must try and find a way to make this group safe. ]
;B[nh]BL[571.458]C[Black jumps protect his group.]
;W[lb]WL[452.023]TR[nb][nc][oc][nd]C[This invasion here threatens to cut off the O18 stones (triangle) and also makes the group weak.]
;B[lc]BL[562.295]C[Black extends to keep his stones connected.]
;W[jf]WL[409.539]TR[nb][kc][lc][nc][oc][jd][nd]C[One point jump to keep attacking the O18 stones (triangle) while strengthening my own group.]
;B[id]BL[555.769]C[Black extends and puts pressure back on the top group.]
;W[hd]WL[399.315]LB[hc:A]C[The hane works here because the cut at A (H17) works in White's favor.]
;B[ie]BL[547.232]LB[he:A]C[This move surprised me because I was expecting the hane at A (H15). Empty triangle is bad shape!]
;W[lh]WL[393.707]C[One point jump that hits the vital shape point for both sides.]
;B[if]BL[520.476]TR[le][me][ne][jf][lf][lh]C[Black strengthens his group while keeping pressure on the O15 group (triangle).]
;W[nj]WL[388.831]TR[qd][oe][pe][qe][mf][nf][rf][nh]C[But now I could launch my counter attack against the R16 group (triangle).]
;B[mi]BL[513.084]C[Black escapes with the kosumi.]
;W[pk]WL[380.871]C[But now I can aim at the bottom right group.]
;B[pj]BL[506.513]C[Black escapes.]
;W[ok]WL[379.359]C[Extend to prevent cutting stone from being captured.]
;B[pi]BL[504.682]C[Black escapes.]
;W[nl]WL[350.431]C[But now I can hane here!]
;B[nm]BL[490.129]TR[nj][ok][pk][nl]C[Black tries to keep pressure on the White P9 stones (triangle).]
;W[om]WL[334.128]C[But White has this cut and is completely safe. Black's center has now been partially ruined.]
;B[mm]BL[476.131]C[Black extends towards the center to prevent White from sealing Black in.]
;W[og]WL[323.445]C[Play on the vital point to create aji for later on.]
;B[of]BL[469.713]C[Black connects solidly.]
;W[ig]WL[285.553]TR[le][me][ne][jf][lf][lh]C[And now I can work on taking care of my M15 group (triangle).]
;B[kg]BL[429.869]C[Black plays on the vital point.]
;W[jg]WL[269.847]C[I connect solidly with the intention of escaping with as many stones as possible (but realize I cannot save all of the stones).]
;B[lg]BL[416.05]C[Black cuts and connects up with his group.]
;W[kh]WL[258.897]LB[mg:A]C[White extends to keep creating aji and simultaneously play the atari at A (N13).]
;B[mg]BL[407.598]C[Black prevents the capture.]
;W[ii]WL[245.395]C[One point jump to continue strengthening my group and try to make eye space. To be honest though, things are not looking too good. ]
;B[ml]BL[395.859]TR[ol][pl]C[Black ataris and threatens to save his cutting stones at Q8 (triangle).]
;W[pm]WL[234.494]C[Capture the cutting stones.]
;B[mp]BL[377.712]C[Black pushes and threatens to cut and/or atari.]
;W[lq]WL[230.044]C[Extends to maintain my base and ensure my group doesn't die.]
;B[lp]BL[372.074]C[Black pushes again.]
;W[kp]WL[220.52]C[Blocks to keep all stones connected.]
;B[kr]BL[354.11]C[Black tries to go for the kill.]

;B[kq]BL[346.16]LB[jp:B][mr:A]C[Black threatens to cut at either A (N2) or B (K4).]
;W[ks]WL[187.449]C[But since I'm one step ahead I go ahead and atari since I'm pretty sure that Black cannot kill me.]
;B[ko]BL[343.567]C[Black cuts and ataris.]
;W[lr]WL[179.477]LB[kn:A]C[I capture to remove the aji of the two stones and threaten to follow-up at A (L6) to render Black's entire sequence useless.]
;B[jp]BL[337.414]C[Black ataris, but this is not sente since White is alive. I have something more sinister in mind...]
;W[je]WL[153.078]TR[nb][kc][lc][nc][oc][id][jd][nd][ie][if]C[This weakness had been sitting around for a while, but since Black did not make the push and cut, I was able to solidify my connection and aim at attacking the O18 group (triangle) again!]
;B[kq]BL[300.445]C[Black captures, but once again, White is alive and so White can tenuki.]
;W[hg]WL[139.625]TR[nb][kc][lc][nc][oc][id][jd][nd][ie][if]C[Which means I can take this powerful extension and severely weaken the O18 group (triangle).]
;B[gf]BL[291.23]C[Black tries to jump out.]
;W[ef]WL[118.68]C[I split Black with the knight's move to continue harrassing the group.]
;B[fg]BL[281.194]C[Black kosumis out to try and escape.]

;W[ei]WL[96.98]TR[nb][kc][lc][nc][oc][id][jd][nd][ie][gf][if][fg]C[But now I can use this knight move to continue harrassing the O18 group (triangle).]
;B[fi]BL[267.891]TR[je][le][me][ne][jf][lf][hg][ig][jg][kh][lh][ii]C[Black attaches to try and make shape and now my K15 group (triangle) is starting to become rather weak.]
;W[mh]WL[35.636]C[When you are weak, it's important to check to see if your opponent has any weak groups so you can counter attack instead of simply trying to make life.]
;B[ni]BL[261.038]C[Black connects solidly.]
;W[lj]WL[16.208]C[Now I try to net the group.]
;B[li]BL[250.742]C[Black pushes.]
;W[ki]WL[8.082]C[White blocks.]
;B[mj]BL[231.188]C[Black pushes again.]
;W[mk]WL[2.796]LB[lk:A]C[With this block, you should notice the double atari at A (M9) which starts a ko.]
;B[kj]BL[196.052]C[Black chose the other route however, and it becomes clear that a capturing race might begin.]
;W[lk]WL[30]OW[5]TR[qd][oe][pe][qe][mf][nf][of][rf][kg][lg][mg][nh][li][mi][ni][pi][mj][pj][qj][qk]C[I obviously must connect to keep the R15 group (triangle) cut off.]
;B[qh]BL[182.497]C[Black ataris to start making living shape.]
;W[ri]WL[30]OW[5]C[Connect to keep Black at risk of dying.]
;B[pg]BL[174.179]C[Black makes eye shape.]
;W[oh]WL[30]OW[5]LB[oi:A]C[The descent here is sente since if Black ignores, White A (P11) would allow White to connect to his other stones.]
;B[oi]BL[167.04]C[Black blocks.]
;W[rg]WL[30]OW[5]C[White tries to find a way to kill the group]
;B[qf]BL[155.978]C[But Black has just enough liberties to survive White's attack. ]
;W[hk]WL[214.767]TR[jj][kj]C[Since Black is fully alive, the knight's move here aimed at capturing the L10 stones (triangle).]
;B[jl]BL[134.607]C[One point jump to escape.]
;W[gi]WL[195.858]C[I attach / clamp now to try and make some kind of eye shape.]
;B[gh]BL[97.154]C[Black maeks the tiger's mouth.]
;W[fj]WL[186.953]C[Atari to keep trying to create eye potential.]
;B[hi]BL[94.578]C[Black counter ataris.]
;W[fh]WL[181.416]C[Capture.]
;B[hh]BL[87.035]C[Black connects, but this is a slight overplay that doesn't work.]
;W[gg]WL[172.493]LB[ff:A][hj:B]C[Because White gets a miai of A (F14) and B (H10) to settle White's group.]
;B[ff]BL[75.68]C[Black connects on top.]
;W[hj]WL[152.929]C[So capturing here was big since White is now fully alive.]
;B[eh]BL[47.121]C[Black now tries to escape.]
;W[dh]WL[134.932]C[I decide to keep Black cut off in hopes of possibly killing Black, but this is a big overplay. White is already ahead in the game, there's no reason to give Black a chance to reverse it.]
;B[fi]BL[43.75]C[A ko begins!]
;W[rh]WL[133.156]C[I connect thinking that this is a legitimate ko threat, but it's not one at all.]
;B[gj]BL[40.825]C[Black captures nearly immediately.]
;W[qg]WL[122.331]C[Now I follow through on my threat. ]
;B[ih]BL[32.816]C[Black surprising ignores me, but should have definitely played at A (Q12) instead since Black would then be fully alive and no capturing race would have started.]
;W[jh]WL[97.725]C[Have to connect to start this capturing race.]
;B[ji]BL[23.145]C[Black is really trying to kill White.]
;W[ij]WL[86.371]LB[jk:A]C[Connects and threatens the atari at A (K9).]
;B[kl]BL[12.238]C[Bamboo joint to keep all the stones connected.]
;W[ph]WL[76.013]C[Time to start the capturing race! (I was pretty sure I was ahead at this point)]
;B[ke]BL[264.258]C[Oh wait. This wedge is sente...]
;W[kf]WL[65.834]C[Have to connect.]
;B[ld]BL[257.612]C[And now Black can take away another liberty. Not looking good....]
;W[oj]WL[58.76]C[I start with this sente atari.]
;B[ng]BL[256.364]TR[og][oh][ph]C[Black must connect, but now my P13 stones (triangle) are in atari. Crap!!! ]
;W[pf]WL[42.153]C[So I try to start a ko.]
;B[sf]BL[253.133]C[But Black has this local ko threat to gain more liberties.]
;W[sg]WL[33.44]C[So I have to block to try and keep tko battle alive.]
;B[pg]BL[249.382]C[Black takes the ko.]
;W[jk]WL[30]OW[5]C[And then I have no choice but to make a ko threat like this to save the group.]
;B[qh]BL[238.37]TR[qd][oe][pe][qe][mf][nf][of][qf][rf][sf][kg][lg][mg][ng][pg][nh][li][mi][ni][oi][pi][mj][pj][qj][qk]C[Black knows that answering White's threat would mean game over since White would then retake the ko and there would be no other threat big enough to compensate for the R16 group (triangle).]
;W[kk]WL[30]OW[5]C[So I capture the stones and settle my group.]
;B[se]BL[232.403]C[Black pushes to try and reduce White and threaten to kill the group, but based on my reading I still coudl live.]
;W[di]WL[251.758]TR[nb][kc][lc][nc][oc][id][jd][ld][nd][ie][ke][ff][gf][if][fg][eh][gh][hh][ih][fi][hi][gj]C[So I took sente so possibly attack the entire K16 group (triangle).]
;B[ra]BL[210.623]C[When Black takes my eye shape away in the corner...]
;W[sd]WL[232.409]C[Descending here was the only option to keep my group secure.]
;B[ch]BL[199.493]C[Black protects the push and cut weakness.]
;W[gk]WL[223.78]C[And then I hurry to seal Black in, but don't realize the impending trouble I'm in.]
;B[pa]BL[181.88]C[With this hane, I'm painfully reminded of the fact that I may have tenuki'd one time too many.]
;W[oa]WL[217.574]C[I have to block.]
;B[na]BL[178.325]C[But once Black puts me in atari.]
;W[qa]WL[216.371]C[A ko is the best I can hope for.]
;B[ee]BL[174.358]C[Black hanes to threaten to connect and save his entire group. ]
;W[sa]WL[204.722]C[But answering that ko threat would generate countless more for Black since he has a lot of forcing moves to either live and connect. So I ended the ko.]
;B[eg]BL[166.075]C[Black now works to save the group.]
;W[df]WL[199.724]C[I connect.]
;B[de]BL[162.784]C[Black pushes through and cuts.]
;W[dk]WL[169.261]C[I play the one point jump here rather foolishly. I didn't see the double atari coming my way.]
;B[ej]BL[154.254]C[Double atari. Ouch.]
;W[dj]WL[164.575]C[Have to save the bigger group.]
;B[fk]BL[150.999]C[So Black captures.]

(;B[jb]BL[30]OB[5]LB[cd:A]C[Black chooses to play the capturing race from here, but A (C16) would have been better. Go back to Move 226 and click on C16 to see what I mean.]
;W[cd]WL[169.685]LB[da:B][be:A]C[Now White has a miai for life. A (B15) of B (D19).]

;W[ep]WL[125.279]C[I make another overplay with this move.]
;B[do]BL[30]OB[4]C[Black's solid connection was the correct refutation.]

;B[nr]LB[mp:A][kr:B]C[I anticipated something like this. which threatens a cut at A while also looking at an invasion at B (L2) to remove White's base. And since Black is strong in the center, a floating group is a BAD idea.]))
