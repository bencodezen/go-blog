;W[iq]
;B[nq]LB[fo:B][cq:A]C[Ignoring White might be difficult for some, but the idea behind this is that I still had two options to respond to White later on. 

Since White made the two space pincer, I decided to play the large knight's enclosure to see what he would do. ]
;W[lq]
;B[cq]C[Since White decided to establish a base on the bottom, I decided it was an appropriate time to take the corner in order to prevent White from gaining too much benefit from my tenuki earlier.]
;W[dq]
;B[dr]LB[cp:A]C[I made a mistake here in the joseki. Should have pushed at A (C4).]
;W[er]C[Luckily my opponent sticks with the joseki anyways.]
;B[cr]
;W[eq]
;B[cp]
;W[do]
;B[cn]
;W[co]C[This push was bad in my opinion. Gives White solid shape and removes any invading aji later on.]
;B[bo]
;W[dn]
;B[cm]
;W[dm]
;B[cl]C[I was happy to take profit at this point. ]
;W[de]
;B[pj]C[With White taking upper left corner and me having no weak groups, I went ahead and decided to take my moyo formation.]
;W[mc]C[White approaches from 2 space. Not very familiar with this.]
;B[pf]C[So I just choose a calm move to hopefully take sente.]
;W[jd]LB[mc:A]C[White makes his own top moyo, but it looks a little odd with the A (N17) stone.]
;B[no]
;W[qc]
;B[pc]C[I decided to block here because if White tries to live in the corner, I'll get power to invade / reduce the top.]

;W[sd]
;B[md]C[With this hane, White's top potential is not looking so great anymore while I still have right side potential!]
;W[lc]
;B[oi]LB[lo:A]C[This was a misclick. I might have played A (M5) if I could have undone the move.]
;W[ch]
;B[ec]C[With the top side so big, I used the attachment to figure out what White wanted.]
;W[dd]
;B[db]
;W[cb]
;B[hc]TR[lc][mc][jd]C[Ah. This is much easier to fight with. And oh right, your M17 group (triangle) is weak now.]

;W[jf]
;B[hf]
;W[hg]
;B[gg]
;W[gf]
;B[ge]C[I don't know if I handled this correctly, but since I was short on time, I wanted to connect in sente and then escape into the center.]

;B[ih]LB[ef:B][hi:A]C[Here I was threatening to get a miai ladder of A (H11) or B (E14).]

;B[hn]
;W[gn]
;B[ho]
;W[go]
;B[kb]C[Upon some further reading though, I thought that White might be able to eek out life. So I played on the vital point to kill it off for good.]
;W[mb]C[I had not considered this variation though...]
;B[ib]
;W[nd]C[Can you see it yet?]
;B[ne]
;W[nb]
;B[oc]
;W[oa]C[*applause applause* Bravo White! What a brilliant connection!]
;B[hp]C[Now that the game isn't so clear anymore, I embark to reduce White's area.]

;B[na]
;W[sb]C[I was probably in my last period or two of byoyomi at this point, and I did not see this variation.]
;B[ra]C[Luckily I could read out that this worked.]
;W[qa]
;B[rb]C[It's a ko, but better than him living outright.]
;W[oa]
;B[ef]
;W[fg]
;B[pa]
;W[aq]C[I stared at this for a while and thought about whether it was a real threat.]
;B[rc]C[After I captured, White lost on time here. But based on my reading, his ko threat does not work since my eye space is too large. So with a bit of luck, I was able to break my losing streak and tilt with this game.])
