;B[qd]BL[2088.17]LB[jc:A][qj:B]C[Black starts off with a 3-4 opening. 

Question: Which direction does this move emphasize: A (top side) or B (right side)?]
;W[dd]WL[2095.59]LB[jc:A][od:C][qj:B]C[Answer: B (right side) is the correct answer. 

White chooses the star point here since it would work well when approaching Black's weak side around C (P16) later on. In addition, the star point is flexible, so that is another reason I chose this move.]
;B[pp]BL[2085.51]LB[dc:B][fc:A]C[When Black plays here however, I have this slight tinge of regret since I can already see the potential approach fuseki at A (F17) for Black that I love playing myself. If I had known this was coming, I probably would have played at B (D17) instead for Move 2.]
;W[dq]WL[2087.88]LB[nq:A]C[But it was too late, so I decided to at least change it up a bit with this 3-4 in order to give myself the opportunity to possibly build the bottom with an approach move like A (O3) later on.]
;B[oc]BL[2065.79]LB[qj:A]C[Black decided to take a calm approach and takes the upper right corner. At this point, it would seem like a move like A (R10) would be appropriate in order to split the right side. However, I've played A (R10) enough to know that I do not like giving Black the option of approaching from whichever side he prefers.]
;W[qn]WL[2064.45]TR[oc][qd]C[So I decided to approach here instead because it makes it difficult for Black to respond in such a fashion that doubles as a severe pincer while also serving as a good extension from the shimari (triangle).]
;B[nq]BL[2057.81]C[Black plays a calm response.]
;W[rp]WL[2044.57]LB[qk:B][qq:A]TR[oc][qd]C[And then I play the small knight's dive here fully thinking that Black would respond at A (R3) so I could extend at B (R9) and negate the power of the shimari (triangle).]
;B[fc]BL[2033.04]C[Except Black can totally ignore White's dive and probe White's intentions here. Great move by Black here.]
;W[cf]WL[2033.03]C[So I decide to play calmly as well since I wanted to take sente to return to the lower right.]
;B[ql]BL[2028.95]LB[rp:A]C[Another brilliant play by Black here. After seeing this, I just cringed as I realized I had been completely outplayed in terms of fuseki. (And as a result of getting so outplayed here, I do not like the small knight dive of A (S4) anymore)]
;W[qq]WL[2027.89]C[I have to take the corner now in order to secure my group.]
;B[qo]BL[2023.37]C[Black pokes at White's connection.]
;W[ro]WL[2025.81]C[White links up his stones.]
;B[pn]BL[2021.94]C[Black now plays the hane to keep White sealed in.]
(;W[rn]WL[1981.3]C[At the time, I was just thinking of defending my stones so I connected solidly. However, this is a passive move and a mistake in the joseki. Go back to Move 15 and click on P7 to see the correct variation. (Thanks to Zak for pointing this one out.)]
;B[pm]BL[2000.01]C[With this, Black has great thickness on all White gets is some first line territory with a bit of corner territory if he decides to play A (Q3).]
;W[iq]WL[1919.96]LB[jq:A]C[With Black's thickness, I decided to make this extension here to negate its power. Some might wonder why I didn't play A (K3) instead, but it's because A (K3) would be too close to Black's thickness and could get attacked later on.]
;B[jd]BL[1963.17]C[With Black's extension here, I feel that Black is winning in terms of fusek and is in the lead in terms of points as well.]
;W[qe]WL[1862.88]LB[qh:A]C[This might seem weird, but I had watched Yunguseng's lecture on attachment and felt this was the proper timing because if I tried playing a move like A, White would get attacked like crazy. You'll see how the attachment works shortly.]
;B[pe]BL[1957.11]C[The first thing to remember is that Black is already strong here, so the attachment is a technique to borrow strength from Black.

Black tries the aggressive hane here.]
;W[pf]WL[1858.93]C[So I hane in response to keep my shape light and see what Black wants to do. Remember, my goal is to establish a position in this area because Black is strong and has a strong presence here.]
;B[oe]BL[1955.62]C[Black extends and gains a bigger corner, but this is unavoidable since White can't destroy both the corner and the right side. And since Black had the corner to begin with anyways, this is not a huge difference from the original result.]
;W[qj]WL[1817.72]LB[rl:A]C[So now I try to probe Black's intentions with this extension / invasion here. I thought that a connection at A (S8) would work, but I'm pretty sure it doesn't work.]
;B[qf]BL[1929.52]C[Black cuts.]
;W[qg]WL[1799.78]C[So I counter atari to try and get some strength.]
;B[rf]BL[1922.81]LB[qe:B][re:A]C[I think this extension is a small mistake, but I think Black should have captured at A (S15) to capture the B (R15) stone and remove the aji.]
;W[rg]WL[1796.37]LB[re:A]C[Now White gets this forcing move that threatens the descent at A (S15).]
;B[pg]BL[1900.53]C[Black cuts.]
;W[of]WL[1793.65]C[I extend.]
;B[og]BL[1894.36]C[Black ataris once more.]
;W[nf]WL[1792.34]TR[og][pg]C[So I extend in order to keep the fight alive and hopefully capture the Q13 stones (triangle).]
;B[re]BL[1892.12]LB[qe:A]C[Black captures the A (R15) stone. And though it looks a if Black got a huge corner, once again this was unavoidable.]
;W[ng]WL[1781.68]TR[og][pg]C[So now I set my sights on the Q13 stones (triangle).]
;B[pi]BL[1874.4]C[Black jumps and escapes.]
;W[oi]WL[1749.94]TR[og][pg]C[And then I try this attachment to capture the Q13 stones (triangle), but it's a fakesuji. Black should just connect at A (Q12)and keep White cut. 

Click on A (Q12) if you want to see how it would have progressed.]
(;B[pj]BL[1815.63]C[Black extends however and is tricked by White's fakesuji. Haha.]
;W[ph]WL[1739.26]C[So I quickly secure my capture so that I am fully connnected.]
;B[co]BL[1633.08]LB[kq:A]TR[pi][pj][ql][pm][pn][qo][pp][nq]C[At this time, while a corner approach seems normal, the Q4 group (triangle) has actually become quite weak and needs an extension like A (L3) to establish a base. By approaching here first, Black is giving White the opportunity to create two weak groups.]
;W[cm]WL[1707.48]C[So White pincers since he is strong and any fight should be in his favor.]
;B[fq]BL[1600.41]LB[cq:A]C[Black double approaches to try and complicate things, but this move only ends up hurting Black because it creates another weak group for Black to deal with later. Black should have considered attaching at A (C3) to settle in the corner instead.]
;W[do]WL[1700.46]LB[fq:A]TR[pi][pj][ql][pm][pn][qo][pp][nq]C[I decided to attach on this side in order to gain some strength for possibly attacking the A (F3) stone and the Q4 (triangle) group later on.]
;B[cp]BL[1563.52]C[Black extends and to strengthen his group.]
;W[dp]WL[1691.98]C[I connect solidly to remove any defects in my shape.]
;B[cq]BL[1537.34]C[Then Black extends again to expand his base and territory.]
;W[cr]WL[1687.12]LB[cn:B][dr:A]C[When I played here, I was concerned with the hane at A (D2) by Black and forcing me into bad shape. However, in this case, White would probably have been better served playing at B (C6) in order to seal Black in while gaining a nice wall.]
;B[br]BL[1532.27]C[Black blocks.]
;W[dr]WL[1680.58]C[And then I connect solidly.]
;B[bm]BL[1494.61]C[Black attaches here to expand his eye space.]
;W[cn]WL[1660.49]C[Though this looks like a normal move, this is actually a TERRIBLE move because it butts the head of my own two stones against Black. In other words, I voluntarily remove a liberty from my group while strengthening Black.]
;B[bn]BL[1492.11]C[Black will obviously pull back to keep his stones connected.]
;W[lq]WL[1561.66]LB[cl:A]TR[pi][pj][ql][pm][pn][qo][pp][nq]C[While the two space extension here is a proactive move that now calls into question the livelihood of the Q4 group (triangle), A (C8) is a very important shape move that has a lot of potential for both players. You'll see what I mean later on.]
;B[go]BL[1353.08]LB[fq:A]C[Black tries to pull out the A (F3) stone.]
;W[io]WL[1545.82]LB[cl:A][dn:B]C[I decide to strengthen my own group while keeping Black weak. However, A (C8) is a very urgent move by White since it helps to protect the cutting point of B (D6).]
;B[gm]BL[1260.94]C[Black jumps.]
;W[fn]WL[1516.17]LB[cl:A][dn:B]C[And I try to peep to protect my cutting point at B (D6), but A (C8) is still the critical shape move I needed to take.]
;B[gn]BL[1253.21]C[Black connects.]
;W[im]WL[1506.52]TR[pi][pj][ql][pm][pn][qo][pp][nq]C[And then I continue to chase the Black group while aiming to severely attack the Q4 group (triangle).]
;B[fm]BL[1211.83]LB[cl:A]C[With Black's turn here, it is even more critical that I take the shape point at A (C6) now.]
;W[oo]WL[1468.28]C[But I didn't realize it was so urgent at the time and decided to launch my full scale attack now.]
;B[po]BL[1180.45]C[Black connects to keep his group united and strong.]
;W[pq]WL[1460.54]C[And then I proceed to remove Black's base while increasing my corner territory.]
;B[mo]BL[1168.74]LB[op:A]C[I was surprised by this because I was expecting A (P4) from Black in order to connect, but Black played this move out of kiai (i.e., fighting spirit) because A (P4) would be too passive. Nothing but respect for that reasoning!]
;W[op]WL[1444.96]C[So I decide to cut Black and see where the fight will lead.]
;B[mq]BL[1113.35]LB[lq:A]C[Black bumps my A (M3) stone to strengthen his connection.]
;W[lp]WL[1388.19]C[Since I have no intention of killing just yet, I decide to strengthen my own group first before I am the one who ends up being attacked.]
;B[no]BL[1106.55]C[Black then makes the strong bamboo joint.]
;W[oq]WL[1315.14]C[And since Black did not cut me, I decided to connect and see how this fight would turn out. Because Black was the one with the weak group, I was hoping I would be able to profit from it somehow.]
;B[nm]BL[1097.43]C[Black makes the nice one point jump to keep his group connected.]
;W[on]WL[1306.18]C[And so I decide to peep at the connections, but this is a false threat. 

Question: What is the correct move for Black to keep all of his stones connected?]
(;B[nl]BL[1032.17]LB[ml:A]C[Incorrect. The answer is A (N8). To see what I mean, go back to Move 70 and click on N8.

When Black played here though, he most likely read that he was connected via a ladder. You'll see what I mean on Move 74.]
;W[nn]WL[1205.12]C[After verifying the upcoming ladder (on Move 74) numerous times, I decided I could cut and decided to take advantage of Black's mistake.]
;B[mn]BL[921.893]C[Black blocks and threatens to connect.]
;W[mm]WL[1197.07]C[And now you see the ladder that I was talking about before. So it's time to test your ladder skills!

Question: Does the ladder work in Black or White's favor?]
;B[lm]BL[889.397]C[Black told me later on that at the time he thought it worked out for him. What do you think? Still good for Black?]
;W[ml]WL[1194.99]C[Based on my reading (and verification numerous times), I was pretty sure it was barely in my favor.]
(;B[kn]BL[859.819]C[Black backs off at this point; but if you think that is still in Black's favor, go back to Move 76 and click on N9. ]
;W[mk]WL[1186.8]TR[pi][pj][nl][ql][nm][pm][pn][po][qo][pp]C[I have no intention to let Black play a ladder breaker in the upper left corner, so I extend. In addition, my other intention was that the Q7 group (triangle) was very much not alive and so I thought that maybe I could kill it.]
;B[oj]BL[776.219]C[Black embarks to strengthen his group and start making eye shape.]
;W[ni]WL[1181.71]C[I extend solidly to force Black to play on the inside and remain sealed.]
;B[qh]BL[751.547]TR[og][pg]C[Black ataris and makes use of the Q13 group's (triangle) aji.]
;W[oh]WL[1089.86]C[So I make the clean capture to remove the aji.]
;B[qi]BL[731.28]C[Black connects solidly to prevent White from cutting and easily connecting.]
;W[rj]WL[1082.28]LB[rg:A][rn:B]C[Based on what I could read though, the solid descent here would allow me to connect to either A (S13 group) or B (S6 group). And even though it looks hopeless, Black can actually live. So...

Question: What is the move for Black to make life? (Credit to Zak for figuring out this life and death problem)]
(;B[rh]BL[728.154]LB[ri:A]C[Black plays here in the game, and unfortunately it is incorrect. The correct answer is A (S11). To see how it works, go back to Move 84 and click on S11.

However, just because Black made a mistake doesn't mean he will die. It is up to White to figure out how to kill Black. So...

Question: How should White respond.]
;W[sh]WL[1078.71]LB[sg:A]C[White wants to prevent Black from connecting under at A (T13), and the hane here is the best way to do it since it's sente. If you don't believe me, just wait a couple of moves.]
;B[si]BL[710.25]TR[qj][rj]C[White was threatening to connect back to the S10 stones (triangle), so of course Black has to block.]
;W[sg]WL[1077]LB[ri:A]C[White connects, but it is in sente because there is still a weakness at A (R11).]
;B[rk]BL[683.951]C[Black tries to complicate things by cutting off the White stones from the other direction.]
;W[ri]WL[1022.05]C[But all White needed to do is cut.]
;B[qk]BL[678.358]C[Black tries to use some forcing moves to hopefully make life.]
;W[sj]WL[1012.55]C[White must capture.]
;B[sk]BL[673.759]C[Black uses another nice forcing move to try and make life.]
;W[si]WL[1011.1]C[White must connect to continue the attack on Black.]
;B[nj]BL[657.449]C[Black threatens to break out while trying to expand his eye space.]
;W[mj]WL[1002.13]C[Remember, the first thing to killing a group is completely surrounding it. Therefore, this move is absolutely necessary.]
;B[rm]BL[649.716]LB[nk:A][ok:B][pk:E][ol:C][pl:F][om:D]C[Black now makes one eye. (If you think you can remove it by playing T7, click it to see why you would be wrong.)

With that aside though, we are actually in a prime position with a life and death problem. And to make it simple, I'll tell you the outcome: White to kill. Click whichever move you think works!]
(;W[nk]WL[963.625]C[Correct. This simple push is the one of three moves that work. (The other two are C and D). Feel free to go back and verify all the other variations if you're curious.]
;B[ol]BL[643.56]C[Black tries make life.]
;W[ok]WL[956.66]LB[pk:A][om:B][qm:C]C[But with this final push, White has a triple miai (A (Q9), B (P7), C (R7)) for killing Black. And with that, Black resigns.])
(;W[sm]C[If you think White can remove an eye.]
;B[sl]C[What happens when Black plays here?]
;W[qm]C[Is this what you were thinking?]
;B[sn]C[But Black has this capture! So in conclusion, Black has a legitimate eye.])
(;W[ok]C[So you think this jump works?]
;B[nk]C[Black will connect here.]
;W[om]C[So maybe you'll try to push now?]
;B[ol]C[Black will cut off the stone. Black is now alive.]
;W[pk]C[And if you thought you could play here, Black actually have an extra liberty and it is his turn.]
;B[pl]C[So he'll capture and be fully alive.])
(;W[ol]C[This is the other way to kill White, but it's slightly more complicated than the acutal game move.]
;B[om]C[Black will definitely cut you off here.]
;W[nk]LB[ok:A]C[But then you must know that this move is the follow up. Black cannot play A (P9) to cut White because it is self atari.]
;B[pl]C[So the best Black can do is play atari from here.]
;W[ok]C[But once White connects, Black is dead with only one eye.])
(;W[om]C[This is also correct, but it is the most complicated variation.]
;B[ol]C[Black will definitely block.]
;W[qm]LB[pl:A][sm:B]C[But then the key move is here because it makes miai of falsifying Black's eye at either A (Q8) or B (S7).])
(;W[pk]C[This move might look stupid, but Black does have to be careful.]
;B[ol]C[This is the most profitable response if I'm not mistaken.]
;W[qm]C[This is probably the trickiest move White has.]
;B[sm]C[Black needs to secure his eye.]
;W[pl]C[And White can try to get fancy here.]
;B[om]C[But Black can just connect.]
;W[nk]C[And White can reduce.]
;B[ok]C[But Black will capture and is fully alive.])
(;W[pl]C[Here's another move that looks stupid, but believe it or not, there is only one move for Black to even have a chance at living.]
;B[om]C[Feel free to verify the other ones, but based on what I saw, this is the only option for Black at this point.]
;W[sm]C[White will then play this hane to threaten to remove Black's eye.]
;B[sl]C[Black will respond and form an eye.]
;W[qm]C[White will then cut here.]
;B[sn]C[Black will capture.]
;W[so]LB[pk:B][sm:A]C[Then White's descent here is actually very strong. Black cannot connect at A (T7) because then White will play B (Q9) and kill the entire group.]
;B[ok]C[Black secures one eye with the most profit possible.]
;W[sm]LB[sf:B][pg:A]C[And now it's a ko to see if Black can live. Black has at least two local threats (i.e., A (Q13) and B (T14)), so he has a decent chance at living. But White can actually kill the group without question, so this result is inferior.]))
(;B[ri]C[This is the correct move to live start the sequence to life.]
;W[rl]C[This is just one variation, but let's assume White tries to connect to his stones like this. Can you find the tesuji to live?]
;B[si]LB[sg:A]TR[oc][qd][oe][pe][re][qf][rf]C[Correct. This descent is the tesuji because it starts by threatning to connect to the S14 group (triangle) with the one point jump at A (T13).]
;W[sg]C[Since White wants to kill, we can assume that White will cut off the connection here.]
;B[rk]LB[rj:A][rl:B]C[Black can now wedge here and threaten to capture either A (S10 group) or B (S8) stone.]
;W[rm]C[Let's assume White connects here since it is the more complicated variation.]
;B[qk]TR[qj][rj]C[Black would then firmly capture the S10 stones (triangle).]
;W[nk]C[Now White can try to reduce Black's eye space.]
;B[ok]C[But Black has just enough space to live.]
;W[om]C[Regardless of how you try to reduce it.]
;B[ol]C[Black will connect.]
;W[qm]C[And you can try once again to kill.]
;B[pl]C[But Black clearly has two eyes now and lives. Is the game over? Certainly not, but Black would not have died.]))
