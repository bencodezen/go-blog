;B[qd]BL[1794.449]C[3-4 komoku emphasizing the right side.]
;W[dc]WL[1794.28]C[3-4 komoku emphasizing the top side which is also the weak side of Black's 3-4 komoku.]
;B[pq]BL[1791.54]C[Black sets up an alternating 3-4 opening that provides flexibility in his fuseki.]
;W[dp]WL[1784.627]C[Since I was one move behind, I chose the star point to give myself flexibility and faster development at the same time.]
;B[de]BL[1772.365]C[One space high approach.]
;W[od]WL[1734.282]C[I decided to ignore and approach Black to see if I could get him to tell me what he wanted before I responded in the upper left.]
;B[oc]BL[1725.834]C[Black chose the attach joseki. This means he would get sente back for the upper left if I played it out and get a lot of initiative on the board. Click on O17 to see what fuseki I saw resulting if I respond as he wanted.]
(;W[ce]WL[1709.821]C[Since I love complications, I ignored Black and attached myself.]
;B[cf]BL[1721.684]C[Black hanes like the joseki.]
;W[cd]WL[1708.25]C[I extend to keep my groups connected.]
;B[cn]BL[1717.575]C[And then he approaches! Ahh!! Was not expecting that.]
;W[df]WL[1685.281]C[I try to immediately punish him for tenuki'ing. ]
;B[cg]BL[1676.595]C[But Black makes the proper response.]
;W[ef]WL[1676.331]C[So I extend to try and maximize my influence.]
;B[cj]BL[1673.69]LB[dj:A]C[Black takes the two space extension and settles his group. Though it does look a little flat, so maybe A (D10) would have been better.]
;W[nc]WL[1663.076]C[And now I go ahead and try to make something of the top.]
;B[pc]BL[1668.676]C[Black follows joseki and extends to keep his stones connected.]
;W[nd]WL[1661.323]C[I connect solidly.]
;B[qf]BL[1666.054]C[One point jump to stabilize the group and expand his corner territory.]
;W[jd]WL[1658.425]C[And iwth thie extension, I get a nice position on top, but upon analysis, I think I would have to prefer Black in this position since he gets sente and seems to be mapped out over more of the board.]
;B[en]BL[1595.026]LB[fp:A][fq:B]C[This jump was a relief to me because the proper move at this point should have been the double approach at A (F4) or B (F3). The reason is because White is weak from both directions and will have a heck of a hard time trying to get out of that situation.]
;W[fq]WL[1640.189]C[Since Black did not double approach, I quickly settled my group.]
;B[jp]BL[1540.528]C[I like Black's extension here. Black's fuseki seems very dynamic right now.]
;W[po]WL[1633.575]C[Can't let Black enclose the corner and create a moyo at the same time.]
;B[qo]BL[1522.322]C[Black attaches again.]
;W[qn]WL[1618.469]C[And at this point I am in Black's area, so best to settle my group now.]
;B[qp]BL[1520.449]C[Extends to keep his groups connected.]
;W[pm]WL[1614.711]C[Tiger's mouth in order to have more influence and power in Black's area.]
;B[nq]BL[1517.885]C[One point jump to stabilize his group and expand his corner territory.]
;W[qi]WL[1612.434]C[Three point extension to settle the group.]
;B[hq]BL[1513.796]C[Though it seems a bit cramped, I do like this knight's move by Black since it puts a ton of pressure on White's corner and also starts to solidify his bottom territory.]
;W[bp]WL[1609.368]LB[cp:A][cq:B]C[I enclosed the corner with this one point jump, but to be honest, I think that A (C4) was the better move since Black is so strong in the area (which makes an invasion at B (C3) quite possible).]
;B[hd]BL[1428.744]C[Black decides to invade. In reality though, I don't think Black was behind, so perhaps a reduction move would have been better. ]
;W[hf]WL[1583.672]C[Since Black seems to want to live in my influence, I capped him to challenge him to live here.]
;B[kd]BL[1336.766]LB[jc:A]C[Black's attachment here certainly surprised me. I expected an attachment at A (K17).]
;W[id]WL[1518.437]LB[hd:1][kd:2]C[Though this move seems a little odd, it keeps Black's two stones firmly separated in an area where White is strong.]
;B[ke]BL[1322.062]C[Black extends towards the center to try and escape.]
;W[jf]WL[1511.803]C[I make the table shape with ths one point jump.]
;B[lb]BL[1277.819]TR[nc][nd][od]C[When Black jumps here, I notice that my O17 stones (triangle) are getting weaker.]
;W[kc]WL[1490.896]C[But I decide to treat them lightly since saving them might mean my top left would get destroyed.]
;B[lc]BL[1262.536]C[Black wants to keep his groups connected.]
;W[kb]WL[1483.676]C[I descend again to seal off a decent top left territory.]
;B[md]BL[1228.176]C[Tiger's mouth to connect Black's stones.]
;W[mf]WL[1439.588]C[I tried to get fancy with shape here and ruin Black's shape.]
;B[me]BL[1195.103]C[I thought this move was a little heavy at the time, but I made a miscalculation in regards to my shape.]
;W[of]WL[1422.736]C[I played here to make another table shape, but had put too much faith in the shape without verifying its strength through a little reading.]
;B[ne]BL[1181.635]C[Uh oh...]
;W[pf]WL[1361.155]TR[nc][nd][od]C[I decide at this point to try and sacrifice the O17 stones (triangle) in exchang for big center influence.]
;B[nf]BL[1161.009]C[Black pushes and cuts my groups apart.]
;W[nb]WL[1322.945]C[So I decide to try and sacrifice sequence here where either (1) Black is left weak and I can attack is on the board, or (2) Black takes the sacrifice and I get the center influence.]
;B[oe]BL[1153.904]C[Black decides to cut me off.]
;W[pe]WL[1289.448]C[I threaten to connect.]
;B[pd]BL[1147.469]C[Black cuts me off.]
;W[qe]WL[1287.642]C[And then I push through here to expand my right territory.]
;B[re]BL[1133.76]C[Black blocks.]
;W[rf]WL[1276.416]LB[rd:A]TR[oc][pc][pd][qd]C[Now I threaten the atari at A (S16) which could threaten the livelihood of the Q17 stones (triangle).]
;B[rd]BL[1132.213]C[Black protects.]
;W[qg]WL[1266.69]C[I made a clean capture.]
;B[ng]BL[1127.583]TR[nb][nc][nd][od]C[But then Black's extension here clearly shows that my plan was poorly planned. Black got to capture the O18 stones (triangle) and also ruin my influence. Rats.]
;W[lp]WL[1212.8]C[At this point White is slightly ahead, but I certainly did not feel that way at the time. So I embarked to try and reduce Black's territory as much as I possibly could.]
;B[on]BL[1119.425]C[Black's peep here was a great forcing move.]
;W[pn]WL[1178.137]C[I had to connect in order to prevent Black from gaining more territory in this area.]
;B[lq]BL[1105.665]C[Black can now respond and start solidifying his bottom territory.]
;W[kq]WL[1169.975]C[I hane to try and complicate things.]
;B[kp]BL[1103.308]LB[mp:A]C[The crosscut was what I was hoping for. I think Black may have been better off playinat A (N4) instead to keep my group weak and attackable.]
;W[mq]WL[1167.139]C[So now I get this atari.]
;B[lr]BL[1101.528]C[Black must escape.]
;W[np]WL[1160.823]TR[pm][pn][qn][po]C[So I make a tiger's mouth to try and connect back to my Q5 group (triangle).]
;B[oq]BL[1086.221]LB[op:A]C[Black connects solidly, but this may have been a bit too easy on White. The hane at A (P4) might have been better.]
;W[mr]WL[1158.072]LB[kr:A]C[So I have this sente descent that threatens the atari at A (L2).]
;B[kr]BL[1079.929]C[Black defends.]
;W[mn]WL[1104.726]LB[oo:A]TR[on]C[And instead of merely connecting with a move like A (P5), I wanted to keep connected with a move active move that would hopefuly capture P6 (triangle) in the process.]
;B[ok]BL[1064.509]LB[qk:A]C[Black threatens to destroy my right territory with a move like A (R9).]
;W[pk]WL[1091.655]C[So I protect it while trying to put pressure back on Black.]
;B[pj]BL[969.132]C[Black hanes.]
;W[qj]WL[1079.469]C[I extend to keep connected.]
;B[pl]BL[964.177]C[Black can now atari.]
;W[qk]WL[1075.936]LB[ol:B][ql:A]C[But I was ready for this and connected. Black cannot descent at A (R8) because White would then cut him at B (P8).]
;B[om]BL[962.422]C[So Black connects up his stones.]
;W[ql]WL[1069.821]C[And then I seal off the right with this atari.]
;B[ol]BL[960.454]C[Black connects, but now Black is pretty heavy and White has a chance to attack this group.]
;W[oj]WL[1019.517]TR[ok][ol][pl][om][on]C[So I try to embark on a hunt to try and capture the P9 stones (triangle).]
;B[op]BL[937.443]C[Black threatens to connect.]
;W[kn]WL[977.345]LB[no:B][oo:A]C[I realize I cannot cut at A (P5) because of the atari at B (O5), so I try to simply escape with my group so that the game can still be close.]
;B[mo]BL[890.027]TR[kn][mn][lp][np][mq][mr]C[Black decided to try and hunt my N2 group (triangle) instead of connecting.]
;W[no]WL[945.689]LB[lo:A][oo:B]C[So I decide to give him a choice and on what he wants to do: A (M5) = I want to kill you or B (P5) = I'll connect solidly and let you live as I chase you into the center.]
;B[lo]BL[864.03]C[Black chose to try and kill me.]
;W[oo]WL[892.421]C[So I decided that we could make a trade.]
;B[mp]BL[848.088]C[Black now reclaimed the bottom as his territory.]
;W[nj]WL[881.724]TR[ok][ol][pl][om][on]C[But now I could aim at capturing the P6 group (triangle).]
;B[ln]BL[844.35]C[Black pushes through.]
;W[lm]WL[867.342]C[This block might be an overplay on my part. I think part of me though I could expand my center territory more with a move like this. In hindsight though, it is definitely a on the greedy side.]
;B[mm]BL[803.698]C[Black ataris.]
;W[nn]WL[858.737]C[I connect.]
;B[ml]BL[801.483]C[Black makes the bamboo joint, and now it's not so clear if I'll be able to capture him.]
;W[kl]WL[815.264]C[I decide to strengthen my groups so that I can keep him firmly trapped.]
;B[ll]BL[734.077]C[Black's atari here is a nice forcing move for getting out, but I couldn't really avoid this since I was weak to begin with.]
;W[km]WL[812.856]C[White must connect to keep the attack going.]
;B[lj]BL[732.36]C[Black can now jump into the center.]
;W[kk]WL[799.708]C[I take away his shape point and threaten to push and cut.]
;B[mj]BL[707.01]LB[lm:A]C[Black makes the bamboo joint and it's start to become clear that my block at A (M7) was probably an overplay.]
;W[mh]WL[778.164]C[Since I had already chosen this road though, I had to try and see it through.]
;B[kj]BL[697.663]TR[kk][kl][km][lm][kn]C[Black pushes out and weakens my L6 group (triangle).]
;W[ij]WL[759.949]C[I try and play a bit wider with this move in order to try and encircle Blackso that I can claim a large portion of center territory. In addition. I didn't want to play the hane at A (K10) because I felt it would strengthen Black when I needed him to stay weak.]
;B[jk]BL[667.786]C[When Black hanes here though, I realize I only have one choice.]
;W[jj]WL[743.171]C[I had to cut. It was do or die at this point since I could not hope to save my L6 group (triangle).]
;B[il]BL[666.103]C[Black prevents the net to connect all my stones up.]
;W[in]WL[734.951]TR[jk]C[One space jump to increase my liberties.

Question: What is the tesuji to capture K9 (triangle) if Black ignores White?]
(;B[gl]BL[591.102]TR[jk]C[Answer: A (H8). Go back to Move 108 and click on H5 to see the sequence.

Black jumps to prevent his cutting stone (triangle / K9) from being captured). ]
;W[gn]WL[674.162]C[Another one point jump to increase my liberties.]
;B[kh]BL[568.672]C[Black jumps to try and connect to his top group.]
;W[lh]WL[640.096]LB[ki:A]C[I used this bump to break his bamboo joint potential and threaten to cut at A (L11).]
;B[ki]BL[554.402]C[Black connects in hopes ot trying to save this now large group.]
;W[kf]WL[617.397]C[I extend solidly here to cut off the Black group from the top.]
;B[nh]BL[516.875]LB[lf:B][kg:A][mi:C][ni:D][pi:E]TR[lh][mh]C[When Black played here, my heart nearly stopped as I thought Black had successfully connected his groups. My M12 stones (triangle) were in trouble now.

There is one way to save them. Click on any of the options (A - L13, B - M14, C - N11, D - O11, and E - Q11) to see if you can find the correct answer.]
(;W[ni]WL[540.854]LB[pj:A]C[Believe it or not. This empty triangle is the only response to keep Black cut off because it prevents the A (Q10) stone's aji from coming into play.]
;B[ih]BL[490.391]C[Black continues to try and escape.]
;W[gj]WL[520.229]LB[gh:A]C[I thought it was over at this point since I thought Black would keep running with a move like A (G12) and I wasn't sure if I could cut Black off while also preventing my own center groups from being captured.]
;B[hj]BL[454.413]C[But then Black does this wedge.]
;W[hi]WL[502.694]C[So I atari from the top.]
;B[hk]BL[451.44]C[Black extends to prevent me from getting a ponnuki (which would be very useful in the event of a capturing race.]
;W[ii]WL[500.355]C[So I connect solidly to keep this group strong.]
;B[fo]BL[427.997]TR[kk][kl][km][lm][gn][in][kn]C[With this move, Black makes it clear that he intends to start a capturing race with L6 (triangle).]
;W[jh]WL[429.051]C[No choice. It's do or die! ]
;B[jg]BL[409.923]C[Black ataris from the top.]
;W[kg]WL[427.242]TR[lh][mh]C[This move is to (1) falsify Black's eye and (2) to also ensure that M12 (triangle) continues to have a miai connection in case Black tries anything there.]
;B[ji]BL[400.003]C[Black captures.]
;W[hh]WL[425.578]C[But I'm pretty sure I'm ahead in this capturing race, so I turn to keep reducing Black's liberties.]
;B[jn]BL[269.427]C[Black embarks to reduce my liberties with this wedge.]
;W[jm]WL[417.455]C[The atari here is the only option.]
;B[jo]BL[259.259]C[Black connects.]
;W[im]WL[415.966]C[Then I must connect to maximize my liberties while simultaneously aiming at a weakness in Black's shape. Can you see it?]
;B[gm]BL[240.786]C[Black unfortunately misses it.]
;W[ik]WL[411.943]LB[jl:A]C[And with this atari, my groups are now all connected since Black cannot connect at A (K8) due to a shortage of liberties. This ends the capturing race and so Black resigns here.

In case you're wondering though, upon review later on though, this capturing race was actually close and was rather risky of White to play out. 

Many thanks to teafree for a great game and letting me use our game in Monday Go Meditation!])
(;W[kg]LB[lg:A]C[So this looks safe. Black can't cut at A (M13) so everything is good right?]

;W[nd]C[Connect solidly.]
;B[qf]C[One space jump to increase corner territory and stabilize the group.]
;W[jd]C[Then White would probably choose a 4th line extension in hopes of getting a top moyo. At this point though, Black will have the option to decide how to either disrupt that or continue with the game.

There's nothing wrong with this of course, but perhaps I thought it was too simple for my mood at the time. Haha.]))
