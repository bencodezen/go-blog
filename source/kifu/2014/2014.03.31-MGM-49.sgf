;B[pd]BL[1792.345]C[Though I am trying to be more creative when it comes to fuseki, I still like keeping my first move here on the star point since my style gears more toward a moyo / power type style. Once I feel like it's time to switch up to a more territorial style (for practice sake), I will definitely be changing this move.]
;W[dp]WL[1794.744]C[White chooses the diagonal opposing corner. This prevents a cross-fuseki and keeps the board still equally balanced.]
;B[qp]BL[1788.811]LB[jd:A][dj:D][pj:B][jp:C]C[This move probably doesn't surprise most of you anymore. For this game though, let's practice positional judgment shall we? 

Question #1: When Black plays on the R4 point, which area is Black emphasizing?]
(;W[ed]WL[1790.717]LB[jd:A][dj:D][pj:B][jp:C]TR[cd][ed]C[The correct answer it B. This is because the strong side of the 3-4 is facing it and it has potential due to the combination of the star point at Q16.

Question: With Question #1 answered, I will assume that you can see that White's E16 stone has the strong side emphasizing the left side, however, the question I want to ask is why did White choose E16 and not a move like C16? ]
;B[fq]BL[1786.459]C[The answer is because the E16 serves to already negate the value of the top by preventing an approach move by Black later on if Black chooses to go with a moyo. To see what I mean, go back to Move 3 and click C16 instead.]
;W[kd]WL[1787.085]LB[qj:A]C[White tenuki'ing from Black's probe is actually normal, but this move seems rather odd since it emphasizes the top again when Black has made no other indication of trying to build off of it. 

If White were interested in countering Black's influence with big broad moves, a move like A (R10) would make more sense.]
;B[pj]BL[1769.571]LB[dj:B][kq:A]C[Since White was playing very broad moves, I went ahead and took a big point myself. This threatens a double winged enclosure around A (L3) if White plays another big point like B (D10).]
;W[hq]WL[1780.556]C[White has no intention of doing so. ]
;B[nq]BL[1755.005]LB[fo:B][cq:A]C[Since White chose the one-space pincer, I decided to enclose my corner with a large knight's move instead in order to maximize the right side's potential later on. 

Please note that Black still has a miai for the F3 stone later on. And while White may be able to get a better result locally if he responds in the lower left now, Black can take the sente to gain a better result on the board as a whole.]
;W[kq]WL[1773.482]LB[fo:B][cq:A]C[White's two-space extension here is not bad, but it seemed a little passive. After all, Black still has miai at A and B and the L3 move doesn't put pressure on anything.]
;B[cj]BL[1739.438]C[So I decide to take the last remaining big point to take away any potential for White to have a grand moyo (at least in the opening).]
;W[fp]WL[1758.833]C[Now we can see White trying to take profit in this area.]
;B[cn]BL[1723.687]C[But Black can make a nice three-space approach and start to settle nicely on the left.]
;W[eq]WL[1746.507]C[White spends another move to protect his bottom, but notice how there are so many White stones on the bottom while Black is spread throughout the board (and even has sente now too).

Question: What area looks the biggest right now?]
;B[cf]BL[1709.798]LB[cl:A]TR[cj][cn]C[Based on my positional judgmenet, the upper left area was woefully empty, so I was happy to take another three-space extension here. 

If you're wondering why I didn't approach the corner directly, it was because I didn't want to give White the option of sealing me in the corner and using the subsequent thickness to attack my C6-C10 group (since it is prone to invasion at A [C8\]).]
;W[cd]WL[1742.801]LB[dc:B][gc:A]C[White protects the corner as expected, but there is still weakness at A (G17) and probing aji at B (D17), so I wasn't terribly worried.]
;B[ef]BL[1704.817]C[A simple jump seemed sufficient since I was starting to solidify my group on the left.]
;W[gd]WL[1730.253]C[This one point jump was in my calculations as well. And while it looks scary since it looks like White is gaining 4th line territory, I've played enough games where I was in a similar situation and then found out converting it to 4th line territory was a COMPLETELY different story. Haha. ]
;B[nd]BL[1681.748]LB[qc:A]C[This move might seem weird to some, but the idea was to give my right moyo a bit of height and structure while prepare for an invasion at A (R17).

What White does next is so typical of what I encounter with Russian/German go.]
;W[ch]WL[1723.747]C[This move might seem like an overplay to many of you. And you would be right because Black already has the one point jump at E14. However, the question that you really need to ask yourself is: How do you punish this overplay?]
;B[di]BL[1661.889]C[Based on my understanding so far, the kosumi (D11) is the proper way to seal White in and punish the overplay.]
;W[bf]WL[1712.486]LB[be:A][bg:B]C[White attaches here, and it looks like maybe he can connect underneath.

The question now is: Which side to hane: A (B15) or B (B13)?]
(;B[be]BL[1635.646]C[Correct. This prevents White from connecting. To see the other variation, go back to Move 22 and click on B13.]
;W[ce]WL[1709.184]C[White cuts thinking he can connect.]
;B[bg]BL[1633.392]C[Simple atari here will suffice.]
;W[df]WL[1707.205]C[White ataris to try and break through.]
;B[cg]BL[1631.977]C[Black connects to minimize aji and prevent a ko.]
;W[dg]WL[1705.05]TR[di]C[White tries to back through and connect, but this is where the kosumi (D11) shines.]
;B[dh]BL[1628.693]C[Now the overplay has been punished and Black is solidified and has solid profit.]
;W[bh]WL[1613.694]C[But wait! White still thinks he has a trick up his sleeve!]
;B[af]BL[1613.795]C[Simple capture is best to remove aji.]
;W[ah]WL[1606.239]C[This descent looks like a tesuji, but it doesn't work.* However, because of White's second overplay, we are in a prime position to ask a basic yet critical question to the reader:

Question: If Black ataris at A (D15), does the ladder work in his favor? (No cheating! Try and read it out as best you can! This is the most fundamental reading skill a go player has in his/her arsenal. So practice!)

* To see the non-ladder variation, click on A13.]
(;B[de]BL[1594.53]C[I read out the ladder a few times to be sure, but it worked as far as I could tell.]
;W[eg]WL[1601.913]C[When White plays here though, I start doubting myself a bit; but after reading it out a couple more times, I still saw the ladder working out in my favor.]
;B[fg]BL[1591.416]C[So I continue on, thinking that if White kept this up, I would have a VERY easy game on my hands.]
(;W[dd]WL[1557.043]C[White realizes his mistake and comes back to seal the corner/upper left top off, which is not necessarily a bad move, but I was expecting a ladder breakder to be played like A (N4). 

If you still can't see the ladder, go back to Move 35 and click on E12.]
;B[eh]BL[1584.613]C[Ladder breakers are the bane of most go players' existence since they are something you have to constantly worry about (because if you forget about it, it will generally have dire consequences later on). So I captured the stones without hesitation to move the aji of the ladder.]
;W[bd]WL[1552.017]C[White comes back to seal off the corner now, but while this seems big in terms of the upper left, it's actually really small in terms of the entire board.]
;B[no]BL[1567.431]C[So I take the opportunity to go ahead and strengthen my corner enclosure while really giving my right moyo shape now.]
;W[pi]WL[1538.107]C[To be honest, I'm not sure how I would even approach the right side at this point, but I will have to say that an attachment like this is actually what Black is looking for. And in addition, this begins a sequence that is an excellent example of why it's important to have a flexible mindset when playing the moyo style.]
;B[oi]BL[1559.959]C[I mentioned before in my reviews that the cross-cut is usually what your opponent looks for to complicate matters and make life. However, in this case, the idea is to use the cross-cut to keep White weak and divided in two groups. You'll see what I mean...]
;W[oj]WL[1524.451]C[White cross-cuts as expected.

Question: In a crosscut, what is normally the best move: extend or atari?]
;B[qj]BL[1552.46]C[The extension is normally the correct move. The atari usually ends up unncecessarily strengthening your opponent. An extension like this one attcks White's base since Black hits the third line first. In addition, it forces White to choose a direction.]
;W[ph]WL[1520.359]C[White seems interested in saving this group.]
;B[ni]BL[1547.416]LB[pf:A][pm:B]C[No problem. As you can see right now. Black right moyo is now being divided, but in another sense, what you should be seeing is the conversion of a moyo into territory. If White tries to help A, then Black should be profitting from B, and vice versa.]
;W[qf]WL[1504.563]C[White chooses to help this side.]
;B[qd]BL[1534.804]C[The key thing to attacking a group is keeping it weak enough that your opponent has to spend moves to help it while you're either making territory or building up thickness for somewhere else. 

In this case, I am starting to solidify my corner while weakening White.]
;W[ng]WL[1496.502]C[White jumps out for eye shape.]
;B[li]BL[1489.98]LB[mf:A][lg:B]C[I also jump out as well to help my own group while threatening to seal White in with a move like A (N14) or B (M13). ]
;W[lf]WL[1443.01]LB[ol:A]C[White has already invested four stones in this area, so it's only natural that he tries to save the group. However, what you should notice is that Black's A area is now looking very nice and has a lot of potential for territory. ]
;B[ml]BL[1436.745]LB[pm:A]C[With this move, Black has really started turning the A area into territory.]
;W[cl]WL[1424.921]C[This is another example of jealously/greediness and another overplay. Do you remember how to punish it?]
;B[dm]BL[1432.714]C[Correct. The kosumi (i.e., diagonal) is the strongest way.]
;W[dl]WL[1416.639]C[This time White tries to resist! Let's see how it plays out!]
;B[el]BL[1429.385]C[This hits two stones on the head while pushing him towards my thick wall.]
;W[cm]WL[1397.712]C[White is trying to force Black to defend his cutting points at A (D6) and B (E7). 

Question: How would you defend at this point?]
(;B[dn]BL[1401.979]LB[em:B][bn:A]C[In this case, my reading told me that connecting here was the strongest since it would prevent White from trying to connect under with A (B6). In addition, I had also read out the B (E7) cut and felt I had no real reason for concern.

If you thought about doing the double tiger mouth shape, be sure to go back to Move 56 and click on E6 to see why I didn't like that shape in this case.]
;W[em]WL[1388.326]C[White seems to think this cut will work. ]
;B[fl]BL[1386.469]LB[fn:A]TR[cl][dl][cm]C[After some deliberation, I came up with this move since it threatens the net at A (F6) while keeping the marked White group completely sealed in.]
;W[bn]WL[1367.749]C[Sure enough, White tries to hane here.]
;B[bo]BL[1381.957]C[But this is precisely why I connected solidly at D6 earlier.]
;W[bm]WL[1358.14]C[White connects solidly.]
;B[cp]BL[1376.448]LB[fn:A]C[I take the tiger's mouth shape in anticipation of either living in the corner of connecting my stones with A (F6)]
;W[cq]WL[1346.393]LB[ao:B][bp:A]C[White's hane here maintains good shape and threatens an atari at A (B4) and then a possible connection at B (A5). ]
;B[bq]BL[1368.058]TR[cl][dl][bm][cm][bn]C[So I decided to permanently cut off the marked stones and take my chances in the corner.]
;W[en]WL[1326.678]C[White removes my net option and it's time to see if my instinct was correct.]
;B[cr]BL[1343.059]C[I atari here knowing full well it would probably end in a ko; however, I felt that there were a number of threats on the board that I could utilize, so it was a relatively small risk in my opinion.]
;W[dr]WL[1306.732]C[As predicted, White takes the challenge.]
(;B[ap]BL[1303.455]C[Normally I'd recommend taking the ko first at A (D3), but I saw one too many ko threats with the atari at D5 and then the subsequent atari at A5. (To see the variation, go back to Move 68) and click on D3). And since I knew it might boil down to a capturing race, I had no intention of giving White so many forcing moves. 

At least with this move, I made an eye and would be in much better shape to fight out this ko.]
;W[br]WL[1285.805]C[Now White really makes this a ko fight. To the death!]
;B[dq]BL[1300.435]C[I capture the ko first.]
;W[do]WL[1255.844]C[As expected, White ataris this group.]
;B[co]BL[1297.223]C[I must connect.]
;W[cq]WL[1252.902]C[White takes the ko.]
;B[cs]BL[1285.859]LB[ar:A]C[This descent here is a local threat since it threatens to make Black live instantly with A (A2) and would end the need for a ko.]
;W[ar]WL[1200.242]C[White has no intention of letting me live, so he takes the vital point.]
;B[dq]BL[1280.567]C[I recapture the ko.]
;W[bj]WL[1159.574]C[With this move, White is threatening to link up his groups nad then live on the left side. And to be honest, I almost let him do so, but then I realized I would be a bit short on territory. In addition, I thought that I still had a number of threats. So...]
(;B[bk]BL[1230.559]C[Let's make sure White can't live! 

If you're not sure how White would have lived if Black ignored the ko threat, go back to Move 78 and click on C3.]
;W[cq]WL[1139.319]C[White takes the ko.]
;B[eo]BL[1215.554]LB[fn:A]TR[em][en]C[This ko threat here threatened to capture the marked stones with a move at A (F6).]
;W[ep]WL[1039.715]LB[fo:A]C[This move here is a mistake by White. The reason for this is because it gives Black a lot more ko threats later on. Instead, White should have probably just extended at A (F5) instead.]
;B[dq]BL[1202.25]C[Black takes the ko.]
;W[ck]WL[1020.062]C[White continuing to threaten to make life.]
;B[bi]BL[1175.486]C[Since I chose to kill the group, no mercy now.]
;W[cq]WL[1013.679]C[White takes the ko.]
;B[fo]BL[1170.315]TR[em][en]C[This is the kind of thing I'm talking about. Now Black's extension here theratens to capture the marked stones.]
;W[fn]WL[989.737]C[So White's only option is this empty triangle.]
;B[dq]BL[1165.905]C[Black takes the ko again.]
;W[aj]WL[964.818]C[This descent looks tricky, but you just have to make sure that you cut it off from the rest of the herd (aka B7 group).]
;B[ak]BL[1144.338]C[So the descent makes the most sense and now White pretty much can't live.]
;W[cq]WL[953.72]C[white takes the ko.]
;B[go]BL[1142.457]C[So many ko threats for Black...]
;W[gn]WL[919.025]C[White must defend.]
;B[dq]BL[1137.152]C[Black takes the ko.]
;W[ci]WL[884.059]C[White tries to connect his group]
;B[dj]BL[1067.345]C[Obviously not letting that happen!]
;W[cq]WL[874.026]C[White takes the ko again.]
;B[gp]BL[1030.938]C[I thought about what to do for a while, but this turn felt rather clever of me since I would be really constricting White if he was not careful.]
;W[gq]WL[865.441]C[White cuts the aparts the groups.]
;B[dq]BL[1025.508]TR[eo][fo][go][gp][fq]C[And now when Black takesthe ko, White actually stands to lose a lot more since the marked stones would suddenly come back alive again.]
;W[fr]WL[844.589]C[White chooses the clean capture since he doesn't want hims bottom ruined. Smart choice!]
;B[cq]BL[1014.118]C[So Black ends the ko and has a nice chunk of left territory now.]
;W[in]WL[813.595]TR[eo][fo][go][gp]C[White's one point jump here is intent on silencing the four marked stones while also gaining some influence towards the center and raising his bottom territory a little bit.]
;B[id]BL[1000.007]TR[kd][lf][qf][ng][ph][pi]C[Since all my groups are rather strong, I decide that now is a good point to use this weakness to see what White's intentions are. After all, his marked group is not quite alive yet.]
;W[ie]WL[798.596]LB[he:A][je:B]TR[kd][lf][qf][ng][ph][pi]C[White's attachment here on the top signifies a bit of a desire to fight. 

Question: Which side should Black hane if he wants to attack the marked group? A (H15) or B (K15)]
(;B[he]BL[971.486]TR[kd][lf][qf][ng][ph][pi]C[Correct. When you want to attack a group in this shape, you should always start by the hane on the OPPOSITE side of where you intend on attacking.

See what would happen if I hane'd at the other side by going back to Move 106 and cilcking on K15.]
;W[hd]WL[792.13]C[White cuts as expected.]
;B[je]BL[969.419]C[Simple atari.]
;W[if]WL[781.917]C[White must extend.]

Question: What is the correct shape move for Black? A (J18) or B (K18)?]
(;B[ib]BL[927.999]LB[jc:A]C[Correct. White cannot cut at A (K17) since it would be caught in a ladder that is in Black's favor.]

;B[ne]BL[837.283]C[And Black severs the connection. 

IMPORTANT: Please note that at this point, I knew that keeping his groups separated adn/or killing one of White's groups was probably going to be impossible. However, as long as I could keep poking at the possibility of killing a group, it would mean free moves for me while White is distracted trying to live and not gaining anything at all (i.e. influence or points).]
;W[oe]WL[551.902]LB[pe:A]C[Take this cut for instance. You might feel tempted to play a move like A (Q15) to kill the group, but that it rather unreasonable.]

;B[hi]BL[587.331]TR[mf][kg][lg][mg][kh]C[So I take great care to make sure that my marked cutting stones don't get caught in some kind of throw-in tesuji later on.]
;W[gi]WL[75.968]C[White tries to keep my group cut off in hopes of capturing it.]
;B[hj]BL[539.045]TR[el][fl]C[With the simple extension, I am aiming to either connect back to my stones at F8 or begin making eye shape.]
;W[gj]WL[14.828]C[White continues to try and keep my group cut off. And while it looks like connecting back to my group might be a bit tough, Black has a move to counter attack White's aggressive push while making eyeshape. Can you see it?]
;B[jj]BL[532.075]TR[lh][mh][ki][mi][kj][mj][lk][mk]C[Even though the marked White group looks strong, it only has one eye. By playing the descent here, Black has pretty much made one eye while threatening to surround the marked White group and capture it in the process.]

;B[ik]BL[528.683]LB[gk:A][jl:B]C[So I go ahead and make my first eye and threaten to connect at A (G9) or atari at B (K8) and kill the group.

;W[gh]WL[30]OW[3]C[White repairs his cutting point. Though it's in gote, it is worth quite a few points. Based on my counting abilitiy, if Black got the cut, that would be worth about 10 points.]
;B[fe]BL[465.067]C[I go ahead and use the rest of the H15 aji with this peep.]
;W[ge]WL[30]OW[3]C[White obviously must capture now lest he has another death wish.]
;B[mm]BL[453.364]C[At thie point. I realized that I am quite ahead, so I set out to repair my weaknesses in the event White tries something crazy.]
;W[ek]WL[30]OW[3]LB[dk:A]C[When White plays here, I'm pretty sure he expected me to cut at A (D9).]

;W[kn]WL[30]OW[2]C[White now tries to salvage his bottom area as much as possible.]
;B[hm]BL[435.019]C[So I decide to poke at the shape a bit in sente.]
;W[gm]WL[30]OW[2]C[Thie move by White is an overplay. Bad shape and doesn't threaten anything.]

;W[lq]WL[30]OW[2]C[This sealing attachment is bad in my opinion. Better to simply block at A (L2).]

;B[ks]BL[377.265]LB[ds:A]C[Since I coudn't find any more sente endgame plays, I came back to this move. However, the atari at A (D1) is sente and should have been played instead.]
;W[js]WL[30]OW[2]C[White blocked.]
;B[im]BL[370.854]LB[io:A]C[And then I found this sente reduction move, so I chose not to finish the sequence at L1 yet. This threatened the double atari at A (J5).]
;W[jn]WL[30]OW[2]C[White connects, but he doesn't realize there's a problem looming over him.]
;B[jm]BL[369.363]C[I can push through again.]
;W[km]WL[30]OW[2]C[And even though White can try to connect.]
;B[kl]BL[365.8]TR[jk][il][jl]C[Once I cut here, White must give up the three marked stones and connect back to his L7 group in gote. After much thought, he resigns. 

For those wondering what the score is, Black is leading by 100+ points. And while it seems like I stomped my opponent, the game still required thorough reading and analysis and was far from easy. There were many treacherous moments that could have reversed the game if I had not been careful. With that said, I hope that you enjoyed the game review!])
