;B[pc]BL[1793.363]LB[jc:A][qj:B]C[Since I got black, I decided to go ahead and play the territorial game that I promised Maaike I would do for the April Challenge. Unless White played something crazy, I knew what my first two moves would be.

Question: Which side is Black's 3-4 weakest: A (top) or B (right)?]
;W[pp]WL[1796.305]LB[jc:A][pe:C][qj:B]C[Answer: B (right side) is correct.

White plays on the star point, which is a great choice in relation to the Black's first move since it would work well if White gets a chance to approach around C (Q15) later on.]
;B[cd]BL[1789.596]LB[dc:A]C[Alternating 3-4 it is! 

Question: Why does Black choose an alternate 3-4 as opposed to a move like A (D17)?]
;W[dp]WL[1794.23]C[Answer: Go is all about flexibility. With alternating 3-4 emphasizing different sides, it gives Black the most options later on.

White's move on the star point here is another flexible move. Very balanced and seeks to ask what Black wants to do.]
;B[cn]BL[1782.98]LB[cd:A]C[I decided to start with an approach move on the left since my A (C16) 3-4's strong side was facing the left.]
;W[fq]WL[1787.237]LB[dj:A][bp:B][cq:C]C[White chose a calm response and patient response. At this point though, if I was to continue playing locally, A (D10), B (B4), C (C3), and D (D9) are moves I might consider (though I will have to say that B (B4) is not one I like to play anymore since it gives White too much flexibility).]
;B[qn]BL[1743.261]LB[pc:A]C[Since I was going to end in gote no matter what, I decided to probe again because I did not want to give White the chance to take the intiative by approaching my A (Q17) stone.]
;W[pe]WL[1781.368]LB[qn:A]C[White goes ahead and approaches anyways. So here's my question to you:

Question: Taking into consideration the A (R6) stone, what is better: pincer or attach?]
(;B[ph]BL[1729.365]LB[ph:A][pi:1][pj:2][pk:3][pl:4][pm:5][qn:B]C[Answer: This is most certainly not an absolute correct answer, at the time hwoever, I felt that in terms of global strategy, The pincer at A (Q12) works well in relation to the B (R6) stone since they are 5 spaces apart and can help each other out if a fight breaks out.

If you're wondering what the attach would look like, go back to Move 8 and click on R15.]
;W[qc]WL[1772.544]LB[mf:A][ph:B]C[I was expecting the joseki at A (N14) to start, but White chose the attachment here. Please note that this is a mistake in this position since the B (Q12) pincer will interfere will White's extension later on (which you'll see shortly).]
;B[qb]BL[1706.8]C[The way to punish the mistake starts with a calm hane.]
;W[qd]WL[1765.408]C[White extends to keep connected.]
;B[ob]BL[1698.609]LB[ph:B][qh:A]C[Then Black makes solid shape. And as you can see now, White would normally want to make an extension around A (R12) next, but because of B (Q12) he is not able to. ]
;W[od]WL[1761.24]LB[mc:A][pj:B]C[So White tries this move here. White seems to aim to gain some thickness, but I was unsure of how to really respond to this. Perhaps A (N17) would have been sufficient, but then I felt that White might try to counter-pincer at B (Q10). Not sure what the correct response really is.]
;B[nq]BL[1629.454]C[Since I was confused about what to do, I decided to go ahead and double approach the bottom in order to see where White's priorities were.]
;W[np]WL[1748.141]C[White decided to attach.]
;B[mp]BL[1619.204]C[To be honest, I think that this move here is the wrong direction of play. When Black makes the hane here, there is an emphasis on settling on the bottom. However, White already has a stone at A (F3) which negates a lot of the value on the bottom. Black's focus should have been on the right instead.]
;W[no]WL[1746.733]C[White extends like in the joseki.]
;B[oq]BL[1603.97]C[I follow along the joseki because I haven't quite realized my mistake in direction of play.]
;W[pq]WL[1745.08]C[White blocks the corner.]
;B[kq]BL[1589.688]C[And then I make a tight extension to ensure that all my stones are connected.]
;W[pn]WL[1742.607]C[White finishes his shape here, and I feel that Black is in a bit of a disarray at the moment.]
;B[pm]BL[1580.282]C[I decide to hane and see what White does.]
;W[qo]WL[1737.689]C[White's hane here protects his corner.]
;B[on]BL[1578.486]C[So I atari instantly to give White bad shape while planning to keep my stones light while I figure out what to do about the right side.]
;W[po]WL[1736.163]C[White connects but makes an empty triangle as a result.]
;B[hq]BL[1567.311]TR[dp][fq]C[Because my group is not quite settled, I decided that the extension here was big since it would stability my group while attacking F3 group (triangle). In addition, this felt like a territorial move that would be in line with my April Challenge.]
;W[cp]WL[1732.223]LB[dj:A][cl:B]C[White protects the corner to strengthen his group.

At this point I considered the extension at A (D10), but felt that with White being solid in the corner, it would invite an invasion at B (C8) which would be a kind of tough fight for Black.]
;B[dk]BL[1554.099]C[And I wanted to give myself potential to build ont he left, so I decided to do a large knight to the 4th line in order to maintain balance of my stones.]
;W[fc]WL[1723.604]LB[fc:A]C[White approaches my upper left corner two spaces away. This prevents Black from being able to severely attack the A (F17) stone.]
;B[dc]BL[1521.424]C[So I decide to continue with my April Challenge in mind and just take the corner and be territorial as best as I could.]
;W[ic]WL[1707.901]C[White extends to establish a base.]
;B[mc]BL[1515.459]TR[ob][qb][pc]C[And so I decide to go ahead and bring my P18 group (triangle) to the third line for better territory and preventing White from any forcing moves that would seal my group in.]
;W[md]WL[1693.207]C[White attaches here to build up power for a pincer.]
;B[lc]BL[1491.561]C[I decide that a calm extension here was needed in order to stabilize my group properly.]
;W[pk]WL[1687.622]LB[ph:1][pm:2]C[As predicted, White pincers and splits Black's groups.]
;B[qk]BL[1404.325]LB[pk:A]C[Though it seems like the A (Q9) stone is weak and I'm violating the principle of touching a weak stone, I felt that this the A (Q9) stone was actually strong since White was already strong in the lower right. As a result, I attached to see where White's intentions were.]
;W[qj]WL[1683.71]C[White hanes to try and keep Black separated.]
;B[pj]BL[1399.549]C[But I welcomed this fight with the crosscut. ]
;W[rj]WL[1664.052]C[White extends as in the proverb, "When crosscut, extend."]
;B[ok]BL[1376.406]LB[pk:A]C[But I'm fortunate that I can capture the A (P9) stone with this ladder. 

Can you read it out? If not, click on Q8.]
(;W[pi]WL[1652.073]C[When I made the atari though, I expected the counter-atari here.]
;B[oj]BL[1338.051]C[So I connect solidly.]
;W[rk]WL[1650.74]LB[oi:A][pl:B]C[I was fully expecting the ascensio at A (P11), but was surprised to see White turn here. I think that he thought I would respond at B (Q8).]
;B[ne]BL[1317.998]LB[qi:A]C[But in reality, I had my eye on the ladder starting with A (R11), so I start by peeping here to see how White responds.]
;W[oh]WL[1629.172]C[White sees the problem and tries to prevent it.]
;B[oi]BL[1303.728]C[I got ahead and cut and make the atari.]
;W[qi]WL[1627.873]C[White connects.]
;B[pg]BL[1280.493]TR[pg][ph]C[And then I extend because I'm pretty sure that White cannot capture the Q13 (triangle) stones.]
;W[og]WL[1625.254]C[White extends to try and fight back.]
;B[of]BL[1274.213]C[But with this hane, I'm ahead in the fight.]
;W[qg]WL[1614.892]C[Surprisingly, White does not try to pull out the P13 stones (triangle), and instead goes for a solid connection and profit.]
;B[nh]BL[1263.863]C[I was happy to connect my groups and secure them.]
;W[ql]WL[1601.983]LB[qm:A]C[When White captures here, I have to admit that I seriously debated connecting at A (R7) since White would get a pretty big piece of territory in the lower right if he got to cut before I connected. ]
;B[hd]BL[1221.169]C[However, the idea of connecting in gote seemed terribly painful, so I thought that it was a great time to go ahead and harrass the group on top to gain even more influence.]
;W[hc]WL[1600.446]C[White extends to keep his stones connected.]
;B[fd]BL[1218.754]C[I attach to keep White sealed in.]
;W[ec]WL[1598.851]LB[gd:A]C[This move is a mistake because White helps Black solidify his wall this way. The correct move is the wedge at A (G16) to create defects in Black's shape.]
;B[ed]BL[1210.787]C[Black is thanking White for this move since his wall has now become very strong.]
;W[id]WL[1597.6]C[White's turn here was a good attempt to try and negate Black's influence.]
;B[gc]BL[1208.271]LB[he:A]C[I was so caught up in taking the wedge move that I played it in the game, but in reailty, playing at A (H15) was the correct move.]
;W[gb]WL[1596.651]LB[he:A]C[I'm lucky that White responds to me, but if White had played at A (H15) first, it would have significantly reduced Black's power on the board.]
;B[gd]BL[1202.356]C[I connect solidly.]
;W[eb]WL[1594.201]C[Unfortunately White plays too quickly here because he thought there was a double cut at A (F18) and B (H18), however, there is no risk of this.]
;B[db]BL[1175.796]C[This move is very small in terms of the global position. It protects a large corner, but a move like A (J15) is much bigger. The only defense I have for playing this move is that I was 95% sure fthat White would respond to this move, so I thought I would be defending the corner in sente.]
;W[fa]WL[1593.515]C[Fortunately for me, White responds and defends.]
;B[ie]BL[1134.534]C[So now I got to take the big point, and as you can see on teh board, Black's framework and influence is quite overwhelming.]
;W[di]WL[1590.759]LB[dg:B][ej:A]TR[di]C[White realizes this, and jumps into the fray. 

Question: Which direction should Black attack the D11 stone (triangle): A (E10 - bottom)) or B (D13 - top)]
;B[ej]BL[1110.488]LB[dg:B]C[Following the proverb, "push your opponent into your thickness" is the rationale for why I believe this is the correct direction for Black to attack. 

If Black attacks from the B (D13 - Top) direction, it would still be an attack but violate the principle of "thickness is for attacking not making territory."]
;W[ei]WL[1577.019]LB[cg:A]C[White extends to gain more liberties. Now if White were anchored on the third line, I probably would have considered a move like A (C13) now to remove his base.]
;B[fi]BL[1109.115]C[However, because White is on the 4th line, I felt that the hane was the most severe response.]
;W[ck]WL[1571.893]C[White then attaches to gain some strength and possibly establish a base.]
;B[cl]BL[1090.026]C[And then to keep maximium pressure, I saw that the hane actually worked and decided to keep White under as much pressure as possible.]
;W[de]WL[1568.63]LB[dd:C][dj:A][ek:B]C[I was surprised to see White walk away and peep here. I was half expecting the push at A (E10) to threaten the double atari at B (E9).

Question: Should Black connect at C (E16) in response to White's peep? ]
;B[ce]BL[1061.43]LB[dd:A]C[Absolutely not, this is the most active move for Black since White cannot cut at A (D16) without being caught in a ladder. Click on A (D16) if you don't believe me.]
(;W[cf]WL[1567.746]C[White hanes here to try and establishing a base.]
;B[cj]BL[1048.343]C[Since White neglected this side however, I decided to go ahead and strengthen my own stones while weakening the White group.]
;W[fh]WL[1565.295]C[White hanes to try and expand his shape.]
;B[gh]BL[1025.622]C[And believe it or not, I was able to make another hane (five in a row!) to keep pressure on White.]
;W[gi]WL[1556.934]C[White ataris to try and create some aji.]
;B[fj]BL[1023.525]C[I connect.]
;W[gg]WL[1555.47]C[White ataris.]
;B[hh]BL[1016.053]C[I extend to ensure that White has to keep fighting for life.]
;W[eg]WL[1554.323]C[White tries to make good shape]
;B[ff]BL[1011.428]C[So I naturally wanted to spoil the shape with this peep.]
;W[ci]WL[1552.284]C[White chose not to respond be submissive, so he descended on to the third line to give himself the best chance at living.]
;B[fg]BL[1003.121]LB[cg:A]C[I decided to cut at this point because I saw my potential for the center and wanted to seal off the White group, but this is rather small and was not really necessary. Instead, a move like A (C13) would have been much more powerful.]
;W[ef]WL[1537.038]C[White was correct to ignore me and expand his eye shape.]
;B[bf]BL[987.122]LB[cg:A]C[I decided on the simple hane here to reduce White's eye space, but again, the clamp at A (C13) would have been much more powerful.]
;W[cg]WL[1505.078]C[White extends to try and maintain his eye shape.]
;B[bg]BL[967.752]C[I extend as well to his his eye space down to a minimum.]
;W[bj]WL[1499.577]C[This is a nice forcing move here to expand White's eye shape.]
;B[bk]BL[955.499]C[Black captures to keep White under fire.]
;W[bh]WL[1498.397]C[White expands his eye shape, and at this point I'm wondering if I can kill him.

Question: Do you think Black can kill White?]
;B[dh]BL[941.425]LB[eh:A]C[I start with jumping in at the vital point hereand threaten to connect with my stones with A (E12).]
;W[eh]WL[1489.502]C[White naturally has to connect. Now, What's next?]
;B[ai]BL[884.59]LB[ah:A][aj:B]C[By jumping here, I had White down to pretty much one eye. If White tries to block at either at A (A12) or B (A10) Black would extend the other direction and connect up with his stones. However, even though White looks quite dead, he has one move to live.

Problem: White to live.]
;W[ee]WL[1395.68]LB[dg:A]C[Though this seems slightly odd, this is the only move for White to live because it threatens to counter attack and kill Black if he tries to kill White. 

If you don't believe me, click A (D13) to see what I mean.]
(;B[dd]BL[763.086]C[Though I initially had the impulse to try and kill White, I was able to calmly read out the threat and had to remind myself that letting White live in gote was still a success for Black.]
;W[dg]WL[1392.814]C[White makes his second eye and lives.]
;B[je]BL[706.158]C[I extended here to expand my center influence.]
;W[mo]WL[1365.618]C[White turns in order to try and gain a foothold into Black's massive influence.]
;B[jb]BL[691.55]LB[ha:A]C[Knight's move to reduce White by threatening to destroy his eye with A (H19) while also securing my top group.]
;W[ha]WL[1360.818]C[White makes his second eye for life.]
;B[ib]BL[685.575]LB[ga:A][hb:B]C[Extension to poke and threaten to falsify the eye at A (G19) with B (H18).]
;W[hb]WL[1360.076]C[White protects his eye.]
;B[da]BL[683.813]LB[ea:B][fb:A]C[Solid descent that solidifies Black's corner territory while also threatening to falsify the A (F18) eye with B (E19).]
;W[ea]WL[1358.959]C[White protects his eye and is now 100% indisputably alive.]
;B[mm]BL[657.185]C[Black now embarks to keeping White from severely reducing Black's center.]
;W[ll]WL[1355.297]C[White tries to make a reduction move here, but it's more of an invasion because you'll see shortly that it's too deep.]
;B[lm]BL[627.21]LB[ll:A]C[Black's extension here cuts off the A (M8) stone and forces White to either try to make life or sacrifice the A stone.]
;W[hj]WL[1348.661]C[White tries to utilize his aji of his stones.]
;B[hl]BL[583.857]C[This diagonal jump is to keep White firmly sealed in and force a life and death confrontation.]
;W[ji]WL[1318.939]C[White tries to make shape.]
;B[jk]BL[564.968]C[This is an attack that also plays on the vital point of White shape (i.e., breaking the dog's face).]
;W[hg]WL[1317.407]LB[ih:A]TR[gh][hh]C[White threatens to capture the H12 stones (triangle) with A (J12).]
;B[ih]BL[559.704]C[Black extends to prevent the capture.]
;W[jg]WL[1310.491]TR[gh][hh][ih]C[White tries to net the J12 stones (triangle).]
;B[ig]BL[555.09]C[But White is too thin for the net to work.]
;W[if]WL[1308.14]C[White tries to block.]
;B[hf]BL[538.163]C[But Black is now perfectly safe.]
;W[jf]WL[1307.176]C[White connects.]
;B[nd]BL[528.414]LB[md:A]C[This move is really big since it allows Black to really claim the center area for himself now.]
;W[jl]WL[1290.772]C[White attaches to try and create complications and hopefully gain shape.]
;B[km]BL[470.786]C[I extend to keep pressure on White.]
;W[ik]WL[1220.964]LB[il:A]C[White tempts Black to cut at A (J8).]
(;B[kk]BL[454.776]C[Black sees the danger of cutting at A (J8), so Black extends to prevent White from gaining eye shape. If you don't see the danger of cutting at A (J8) though, go back to Move 126 and click on J8.]
;W[il]WL[1219.22]C[White connects to try and possibly escape down the bottom.]
;B[hm]BL[449.285]C[So I calmly descended to minimize my cutting points.]
;W[kl]WL[1203.485]LB[lj:A]C[White connects and threatens the net of A (M10).]

;W[gk]WL[1196.259]C[White tries to escape.]
;B[hk]BL[324.258]LB[fm:A]C[And then I decide to end all discussion by cutting now to cash in on my center profit. However, a move like A (F7) would probably have been better.]
;W[gj]WL[1187.818]C[White connects.]
;B[ij]BL[309.893]C[And now I can cut!]

;W[jn]WL[1163.22]C[White has to play the empty triangle to connect.]

;W[dj]WL[1161.3]LB[ck:A][ek:B]C[When White plays here, if you instinctively connect at A (C9), you'll miss the fact that White is really aiming at B (E9).]
;B[fl]BL[190.68]C[I saw that coming though, so I defended with the best shape I knew possible.]
;W[bn]WL[1134.098]C[White attachment here was a great reduction.]

;W[co]WL[1130.975]LB[bm:A][dn:B]C[White crosscuts. While you might be tempted to atari at A (B7), White will then be able to counter atari at B (D6) and reduce Black's area.]

;W[ck]WL[1126.182]C[White takes the ko.]

;W[gr]WL[1118.382]C[White play the diagonal to reduce Black's bottom.]
;B[hr]BL[118.156]LB[pr:A]C[Black descends and blocks, but it would have been better to play A (Q2) instead since it has some sente value.]
