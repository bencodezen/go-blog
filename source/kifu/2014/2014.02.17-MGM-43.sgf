;B[pd]BL[1793.265]
;W[dp]WL[1794.691]C[Love it when White opens here. Gives me free reign to choose whatever I want to do.]
;B[qp]BL[1787.51]C[Most of you should not be surprised by this.]
;W[dc]WL[1786.07]C[White's 3-4 komoku's strong side is facing the top side.]
;B[fq]BL[1785.573]C[Probe approach.]
;W[hq]WL[1779.11]C[This low one-space pincer is aggressive.]
;B[oq]BL[1745.925]LB[fo:B][cq:A]C[A and B is still miai for Black to utilize later, so I enclosed strongly so I could play aggressively later on.]
;W[dq]WL[1755.68]C[White tries to "punish my mistake by trying to secure the corner.]
;B[cn]BL[1733.328]C[However, his corner is far from secure, so I decided to hit the weak point with a double approach.]
;W[gp]WL[1743.684]TR[fq]C[White wants to eat the marked stone, but White is super overconcentrated and the F3 stone aji is still far from gone.]
;B[de]BL[1729.59]C[I don't want to overcommit my stones just yet, so I decide to approach the upper left.]
;W[ce]WL[1737.886]C[I half expected a pincer, but was delighted to see the attachment.]
;B[cf]BL[1727.747]
;W[cd]WL[1733.166]
;B[df]BL[1726.68]
;W[fc]WL[1729.151]
;B[dj]BL[1725.023]C[Normal joseki sequence that synergizes nicely with B6.]
;W[dl]WL[1724.318]C[White tries to invade.]
;B[cl]BL[1692.088]C[I connect solidly.]
;W[ck]WL[1720.705]C[White tries to aggressively hane and cut Black apart.]
;B[dk]BL[1664.223]
;W[cm]WL[1717.404]C[Still going for the cut.]
;B[bl]BL[1659.651]LB[bm:A][dm:B]C[Naturally I descend, and now I have a miai of A or B. White cannot cut if he descends at A. See variation.]
(;W[dm]WL[1701.986]C[White must connect.]
;B[bm]BL[1657.509]C[I'm still connected!]
;W[dn]WL[1696.482]C[White extends for shape.]
;B[co]BL[1654.148]C[I extend to take away the shape point while further damaging the corner potential.]
;W[kq]WL[1691.655]C[This two space extension is very small. Look at how big the rest of the board is! And it's a terrible use of White's thickness.]
;B[pj]BL[1637.919]LB[nc:A][qf:B]C[So I take the big point on the right side.

Question: White wants to approach the upper right. Where should he approach? A or B?]
(;W[nc]WL[1686.757]LB[pf:A][qf:B]C[Correct. This follows the principle of approaching from the wider side.

Question: Assuming Black does not want to pincer, which is the better response? A or B.]
(;B[pf]BL[1619.265]C[Correct. The high jump here is appropriate (in my opinion) since it synergizes wiell with the Q10 stone and is consistent with Black's intention of building the right side.]
;W[kd]WL[1675.705]LB[pb:A][kc:C][jd:B]C[I've been seeing this jump lately, but in my opinion, I don't really like it since it seems like a half-hearted attempt at building the top. For those who don't know, the normal response is A or B. This move seems about as flawed as the two space extension at C since it gives Black the opportunity to immediately kick and overconcentrated White.]
;B[lp]BL[1569.527]C[I decided to shoulder hit and build the right side.]
;W[lq]WL[1665.726]C[This third line extension is bad because it focuses on taking territory. Instead, I would have thought that White would play A and work on trying to build some territory with this thickness on the left.]
;B[mp]BL[1560.12]C[I pull back to keep my stones connected.]
;W[nm]WL[1639.466]LB[nl:B][mm:A]C[This may seem like a nice reduction move, but based on my understanding, it's actually one point too far into Black's framework. A or B seems to be more in line with the principle of "reduce by playing on the border of your opponent's framework.]
;B[lm]BL[1549.873]C[Simple decision. Cap here in good form while cutting off a running direction for White.]
;W[nk]WL[1636.342]
;B[lk]BL[1526.111]C[Keeping the pressure on.]
;W[mj]WL[1592.044]
;B[lj]BL[1512.2]C[Playing solid.]
;W[mi]WL[1583.298]
;B[me]BL[1505.225]C[Leaning attack! (Although I think White should probably ignore this.]
;W[md]WL[1567.902]C[But he doesn't.]
;B[ol]BL[1487.82]C[Peep and make him heavy!]
;W[nl]WL[1562.273]
;B[kh]BL[1484.481]C[Knight's move is for attacking!]
;W[mg]WL[1553.096]C[Where are you running to?]
;B[le]BL[1468.839]C[Solid extension that hopes to keep White boxed in.]
;W[lg]WL[1540.423]LB[ld:A]C[White is smart not to respond at A.]
;B[ke]BL[1437.601]C[I extend once more hoping to provoke a response out of White.]
;W[jd]WL[1532.16]TR[lg][mg][mi][mj][nk][nl][nm]C[Though this helps White build the top some, this ignores the immediate problem of his weak marked group.]
;B[kg]BL[1425.661]C[Now White is sealed in.]
;W[qj]WL[1479.309]LB[pi:A][qi:B]C[White trying to make some magic!

Question: Assuming Black will play locally, what is the best response? A or B?]
(;B[pi]BL[1385.156]C[Correct. This minimizes any complication that White can cause.]
;W[pk]WL[1419.767]C[White tries to cut.]
;B[qk]BL[1371.028]C[After some analysis, I realized that killing the group might prove difficult, so I cross cut in hopes to just take profit in sente.]
;W[pl]WL[1409.725]
;B[ql]BL[1358.876]C[Lovely profit...]
;W[pm]WL[1403.578]
;B[qm]BL[1327.112]
;W[oj]WL[1398.034]
;B[oi]BL[1322.71]C[White's group is not alive yet, still more harrassing to do while gaining points!]
;W[ni]WL[1394.641]
;B[on]BL[1316.912]C[O8 aji not gone yet!]
;W[om]WL[1384.924]
;B[mk]BL[1314.122]C[Where are you going to run? Only one eye so far!]
;W[oh]WL[1358.941]
;B[og]BL[1293.537]LB[nh:B][ph:A]C[This clamp move is over aggressive since White can force at A before connecting at B.]
;W[nh]WL[1329.397]LB[lh:A][ph:B]C[I'm lucky though since White is purely concerned about living. At this point, many players would consider playing A in hopes of killing the group, but as I mentioned before, the forcing move at B can force Black into a tricky situation that could destroy all of the profit he built before.]
;B[ph]BL[1270.906]C[This move is probably the move I'm proudest of this game since it showed my ability to restrain my desire to kill and simply takes very secure 4th line profit on the right side.]
;W[lh]WL[1324.471]C[White makes life in gote. Black is very happy to get sente now.]
;B[do]BL[1242.848]C[After some reading, I realized that the push and cut would work.]
;W[eo]WL[1319.243]
;B[en]BL[1239.203]
;W[el]WL[1302.828]C[This move is so vulgar. I'm not sure where White plans on running, but I think it would have been better to just give up those stones. There's no point saving them.]
;B[fn]BL[1229.993]C[Simple extension was enough for me since I had plans to build the center or wreck the bottom.]
;W[go]WL[1279.201]LB[fo:A]C[This iron pillar puzzled me. I totally expected A.]
;B[fo]BL[1223.887]C[Free atari? Sure!]
;W[ep]WL[1268.243]
;B[fp]BL[1222.835]C[And will you look at that, the F3 stone is alive again. So much for White spending four moves trying to kill it earlier.]
;W[bq]WL[1257.022]C[White now must try to make life in the corner.]
;B[er]BL[1182.04]C[But it won't be that easy! Eye space reducing kosumi!]
;W[dr]WL[1240.685]
;B[cp]BL[1171.85]C[Reducing eye space again!]
;W[cq]WL[1234.671]
;B[bs]BL[1148.824]C[Going for the kill!]
;W[bp]WL[1213.552]
;B[bo]BL[1139.182]C[Trying to keep White's eye space to a minimum.]
;W[br]WL[1053.724]LB[ao:A][cs:C][ds:B]C[Based on my reading ability, this is a mistake. I think that White should have forced at A first in order to maximize his chance of making life.

When White plays here, I think he's expecting me to jump at B and then start a ko at C; but my life and death skills are better than that!]
;B[cs]BL[1092.511]C[Boom! Eye destroyed and you still need to stop me from connecting!]
;W[ds]WL[1027.575]C[White must block.]
;B[ap]BL[1077.606]C[Now you see what I mean right? Without the forcing move at A, Black can easily reduce White to a dead shape now.]
;W[as]WL[982.266]LB[aq:A][ar:B]C[Question: Should Black play A or B to kill the group?]
(;B[aq]BL[1063.379]C[Correct! Give White his one eye. He needs two to live. =D]
;W[ar]WL[875.925]LB[an:A][ao:B]C[Final Question: This determines the fate of your group. White is down to one eye. How do you finish him off? A or B?]
(;B[an]BL[996.796]C[Correct. This is the only move. (If you disagree with me, check out the other variation!) And with that, White resigns. ])
(;B[ao]C[I almost connected here on impulse. After all, White was dead! He only has one eye? Right?]
;W[an]C[Oh wait...]
;B[bn]C[No choice.]
;W[bk]C[Uh oh... ]
;B[es]
;W[al]C[Suddenly all your effort at killin the corner is not only wasted, but White now has broken into Black's left side. A truly vivid example of how one move can change the course of the entire game.]))
(;B[ar]C[This might be the first impulsive move that a lot of players will make especially during a game.]
;W[aq]C[So Black has an option of playing out a ko, but I'm sure some of you are thinking, "Wait! There's another option right?"]
;B[as]C[You mean connecting solidly? You're probably thinking this is bent in four and White's dead right?]
;W[cr]C[White captures. ]
;B[bs]C[Black plays on the vital point.]
;W[as]
;B[ar]C[Isn't this just another ko?]
;W[cs]C[Bam. Black is crushed because White has outside liberties and White lives!]))
(;B[qi]C[Incorrect. White's response will show you why.]
;W[pi]C[Remember, White is dying in your sphere of influence. Giving White the opportunity to crosscut and create complications is precisely what White needs to possibly make life.]))
(;B[qf]LB[pf:A]C[I don't think that this is necessarily "wrong," however based on my studies tso far, this move is not as good at A (Q14) because it is inconsistent with Black's intention of building the right side.]))
(;W[qf]TR[pj]C[Incorrect. This violates the principle of approaching from the wider side. In addition, White is already pincered by the Q10 stone. And the following sequence is possible.]
;B[qe]
;W[pf]
;B[nd]
;W[ph]
;B[qj]C[White looks cramped no? In the meantime, Black starts to gain a corner while building the bottom right and White gets a weak group. Bad for White.]))
