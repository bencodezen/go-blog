;B[pd]BL[1790.326]C[As always, I open with the 4-4 star point in order to give myself maximum flexibility. However, I will also have to admit that it's also become a place of comfort for me since I'm quite familiar with numerous fuseki in relation to the star point.]
;W[dc]WL[1793.648]C[White plays the 3-4 and emphasizes the top.]
;B[qp]BL[1778.612]C[I then go ahead and setup my typical 3-4 that prepares to probe White's lower left corner.]
;W[op]WL[1788.825]C[I guess Nate must dislike having to deal with that fuseki as White, so he immediately approached here.]
;B[eq]BL[1767.76]C[I have had some experience with the A (P4) immediate approach before, so I decided to ignore and play the 5-3 point here to possibly take advantage of the approach later on.]
;W[qq]WL[1770.23]C[White attaches immediately to prevent Black from gaining any sort of whole board advantage as a result of his tenuki. See Monday Go Meditation - Game 48 for an example of that.]
;B[cp]BL[1753.31]LB[dc:A]C[I decided to go ahead and enclose the corner here in preparation of taking advantage of White's A (D17) 3-4's weak side if White responded in the lower right again.]
;W[cj]WL[1762.696]C[White immediately takes the big strategic point and negates the strong side of my shimari.]
;B[rq]BL[1743.49]C[So now I decide to return to the lower right in order to bring some balance back to the game.]
;W[pq]WL[1759.651]C[White extends per joseki to keep his stones connected.]
;B[qm]BL[1741.372]LB[ro:A]C[And then I experiment with this two space jump. The more solid variation is at A (S5).]
;W[kq]WL[1714.419]C[And then White takes a nice 3-space extension. At this point, it seems like the board is relatively balanced. It doesn't seem like any player has a significant advantage just yet. I could be wrong though.]
;B[cl]BL[1698.718]LB[jc:A]C[At the time, I extended here because I thought it would allow me to build a nice lower left moyo. However, upon analysis now, it feels like a move at A (K17) would be much better since it would be much bigger than my 3-space extension here. This is probably the first major mistake I made this game.]
;W[ej]WL[1693.018]C[White jumps as expected, and if you notice, his upper left looks like it has FAR more potential that my lower left one.]
;B[el]BL[1674.217]LB[jd:A]C[I go ahead and jump too. At the time, I'm thinking that I'm making nice box shape. However, I really do feel that if White were to play a move like A (K16) right now, White would be in much better shape than Black.

In addition, I'll also note that at the time, I probably felt as if White's position was thin and that I was confident in my ability to invade and destroy that area. While foolish, it kind of explains why I played the moves I did.]
;W[nc]WL[1676.057]LB[jd:A]C[When White approached here, I knew that as white, I would definitely want to get the A (K16) point if at all possible.]
;B[lc]BL[1663.744]C[So the pincer was an absolute no-brainer because I was not about to left White have a bigger moyo that it was already threatening to be.]
;W[ne]WL[1659.528]C[White one-space jumps up to keep the black stones split.]
;B[pf]BL[1661.838]C[Per joseki, I jump once on the side for territory.]
;W[kd]WL[1642.472]LB[lc:A]C[Then White comes back to press my A (M17) stone.]
;B[kc]BL[1659.599]C[Black extends to stabilize his group.]
;W[jd]WL[1640.317]C[White extends to stay one step ahead of Black while keeping maximum pressure on him while gaining strength.]
;B[ld]BL[1658.187]C[This move here threatens to break out into the center while separating the white stones.]
;W[le]WL[1638.667]C[So White will block here.]
;B[jc]BL[1657.029]C[Then Black will push again to stabilize his group and gain a base.]
;W[id]WL[1636.794]C[White will extend solidly again to gain influence and keep pressure on Black.]
;B[hc]BL[1655.848]C[Then Black can safely one-space jump to expand his base.]
;W[ge]WL[1634.199]C[White then completes the joseki with the knight's move (which pretty much seals Black off from the center).]
;B[iq]BL[1640.96]LB[gc:A]C[Normally, Black will respond at A (G17) to further stablilize his group, but I felt that giving White sente would be too good, so I chose this double winged (albeit small) extension to really make a sizable lower left moyo.]
;W[eo]WL[1628.925]LB[gn:A]C[White sees the impending problem, but I feel that this invasion was too deep. A reduction move like A (G6) seems like it would be more than adequate.]
;B[io]BL[1624.847]LB[gn:B][mq:A]C[I decided to surround the group from a distance because I was also eyeing the invasion weakness around A (N3). If I had wanted to be the most severe though, perhaps B (G6) would have been best.]
;W[co]WL[1625.304]C[White attaches to try and make shape.]
;B[bp]BL[1596.193]C[But since I'm strong in the area, I felt that the descent was the strongest reply at the time since it didn't allow White any opportunity to use cutting aji or hanes to make eye shape.]
;W[bo]WL[1620.614]C[When White descends here, it seems like he may be aiming for a connection around the A (B8) area. However, based on what I could read, he was one space too far from making it work.]
;B[dp]BL[1589.586]C[So I decided to go ahead and take the shape point while also solidifying a rather large corner for myself.]
;W[do]WL[1610.663]TR[bo][co][do][eo]SQ[cl][el]C[White's connection here felt rather heavy. After all, the E5 group (triangle) was still without a base. Perhaps White's thoughts at the time were to generate some thickness to counterattack the E8 group (square).]
;B[fm]BL[1561.554]C[In order to prevent such a counterattack, I made the kosumi (i.e., diagonal) in order to strengthen my group while keeping full pressure on White.]
;W[fq]WL[1607.62]C[White attaches to try and make shape.]
;B[fr]BL[1553.238]C[But the simple hane under seemed to suffice in terms of keeping White to no eyes.]
;W[bl]WL[1571.56]C[White now tries to make use of this area here to possibly connect.]
;B[bm]BL[1543.737]LB[cm:A]C[But after a bit of more reading, I was pretty confident that even if White crosscut at A (C7) (which would be the most likely scenario since White is trying to live and would want to complicate things), it wouldn't work.]
;W[cm]WL[1561.945]C[Sure enough, as predicted, White crosscuts to try and complicate things.]
(;B[dm]BL[1500.829]LB[fm:A]C[Unfotunately, when I read this out, I thought that the atari from this direction was correct since I would be utilizing my kosumi A (F7) earlier to protect my cutting points. I am lucky it worked out in my favor, but the correct direction to atari from should have been B (B9). 

To see why, go back to Move 42 and click on B9.]
(;W[bn]WL[1483.379]LB[am:B][cn:A]C[I am fortunate that White chooses this variation. I believe at the time, he was probably expecting me to capture at A (C6) and then he could connect under at B (A7). However, this was unfortunately the wrong order of moves for him.

To see how White should have taken advantage of Black's mistake, go back to Move 43 and click on A7.]
;B[am]BL[1486.78]LB[bk:B][cn:A]C[However, White probaby failed to account for this descent, which cuts him off indefinitely since Black now has a miai for A (C6) and B (B9).]
;W[gq]WL[1436.809]LB[ir:A]C[White extends and seems to threaten a connection underneath at A (J2).]
;B[ir]BL[1443.084]C[So I play the iron pillar to minimize any aji and keep White firmly surrounded.]
;W[gn]WL[1421.241]C[White threatens to break out here.]
;B[hm]BL[1429.633]C[But after some reading, I decided that this was the most severe move to seal White in and not allow him any easy cutting aji.]
;W[gr]WL[1401.267]LB[er:A]C[White turns down and threatens to atari at A (E2) to make an eye.]
;B[er]BL[1394.422]C[So I go ahead and connect solidly, but I realized shortly what White was really after.]
;W[cr]WL[1389.018]C[Since White cannot make life for his G2 (triangle) group, this is actually a brilliant alternative to making something happen here: Kill Black's corner.]
;B[br]BL[1357.146]C[With White hitting the vital point of my shape, I thought for a while about the best way to respond. After about a minute, I decided the attachment was the strongest response while minimizing White's ability to try anything fancy.]
;W[ep]WL[1373.781]C[When White cuts here, he is attacking the corner, but after a bit of reading, I felt that my corner was alive and would not die.]
(;B[ho]BL[1260.913]LB[ip:A]C[I was concerned with the wedge aji at A (J4) here, so I decided to strengthen my connection while further ensuring White's inability to escape.

To see what I was worried about, go back to Move 54 and click on A4.]
;W[ap]WL[1324.522]C[White hanes to try and reduce Black's eye space.]
;B[aq]BL[1202.265]C[But based on my reading, the block here was more than adequate to make life.]
;W[dq]WL[1273.637]LB[bq:A]C[White cuts here to threaten the snapback at A (B3).]
;B[dr]BL[1190.063]C[But I had already considered that threat and knew that this atari  would settle the life and death problem once and for all.]
;W[qh]WL[1202.575]C[With the lower left corner firmly dead, White now turns his attention to Black's right side and promptly hits on a weak spot in Black's shape.]
;B[qj]BL[1152.533]TR[pd][pf]SQ[qm][qp][rq]C[At first instinct, I felt very concerned about my Q16 stones (triangle). However, I couldn't find a good move to defend them, so I chose to pincer while helping out my R4 group (square) as well.]
;W[og]WL[1195.723]C[White firmly seals Black in with this knight's move. Very nice.]
;B[qc]BL[1144.381]C[Since White cut off the center, I felt that the 3-3 was the only choice in order to ensure I lived.]
;W[qe]WL[1150.226]C[White hits another vital point in Black's shape.]
;B[pe]BL[1134.988]C[I went and and connected solidly in order to keep my stones strong for the fight that was breaking out.]
;W[qf]WL[1145.77]
;B[pg]BL[1128.513]LB[qg:B][ph:A]C[With this extension, I was confident of being able to take advantage of either A (Q12) or B (R13).]
;W[ph]WL[1144.475]C[White chooses to block the center.]
;B[qg]BL[1125.882]C[So I go ahead and push through.]
;W[rg]WL[1142.969]LB[rf:B][rh:A]C[Here is a classic shape that kyu players should become very familiar with. White has two cutting points: A (S12) and B (S14). Make sure you learn how to take advantage of this.]
;B[rh]BL[1062.624]LB[rf:A][ri:B]C[I personally prefer this cut because it gives Black the option of taking the corner with A (S14) if White chooses to atari at B (S11).]
;W[re]WL[1108.237]C[White chooses to try and make life.]
(;B[ri]BL[1052.295]LB[sg:A]TR[qe][re][qf][rg]C[I thought this extension would be strong because I thought the S15 group (triangle) was dead, however, on second glance, this is slack and I should have atari'd at A (T13). Go back to Move 72 and click on T13 to see what I mean.]
;W[rc]WL[1103.724]C[Because of Black's slack move, White had a moment to breathe and try and extend his eye space.]
;B[rb]BL[1035.445]TR[rc][qe][re][qf][rg]C[Black must hane in order to have any chance of killing the S15 (triangle) group.]
;W[qd]WL[1079.074]LB[qb:A]C[White threatens the cut/atari at A (R18).]
;B[pc]BL[1026.319]C[I decided to connect solidly in the event this tured into some sort of semeai (i.e., capturing race).]
;W[sd]WL[1077.194]C[White then makes one eye, and I'm confronted with a ko. Not good for Black because White is looking for complications to try and catch back up in the game.]
;B[sg]BL[1021.765]C[At the time, it felt like the ko was the only option, but after reviewing the recent jubango game between Lee Sedol 9p and Gu Li 9p, perhaps Black could have tenuki'd and waited for when he had more ko threats.]
;W[sf]WL[1075.856]C[White makes the ko shape.]
;B[rf]BL[1019.351]C[And the ko battle begins!]
;W[cq]WL[1072.275]C[Unfortunately, White has a ko factory here (meaning an area that generates numerous ko threats). So Black is in for a long battle...]
;B[bq]BL[1017.42]C[Had to respond. This area is too big.]
;W[rg]WL[1071.421]C[White takes the ko.]
(;B[mq]BL[978.607]LB[oh:A]C[I thought this would be severe since I would "kill" the entire bottom, but this move is not only a mistake, but probably the losing move of the game. I should have actually played at A (P12) instead. To see why, go back to Move 84 and click on P12.]
;W[oh]WL[1060.135]TR[rb][pc][qc][pd][pe][pf][pg][qg]C[To my surprise and disappointment, White repairs his cut and now the ko is really important to Black since the R17 group (triangle) is without eyes.]
;B[rf]BL[943.629]C[So I retake the ko.]
;W[cs]WL[1056.641]LB[bs:A]C[White makes another threat by threatening to atari at A (B1).]
;B[bs]BL[921.469]C[No choice. Must respond.]
;W[rg]WL[1054.676]C[White takes the ko again.]
;B[mo]BL[847.153]C[And once again, I am thinking that White HAS to respond down here. After all, everything would die and I would own the entire bottom. 

Hint: This was a gross miscalculation on my part.]
;W[sh]WL[1049.096]TR[rb][pc][qc][pd][pe][pf][pg][qg]C[White ends the ko to my dismay. And now my R17 group (triangle) is in jepordy. ]
;B[nb]BL[838.996]C[So now I try to make life because giving White this whole corner would be huge.]
;W[mb]WL[1033.327]TR[hc][jc][kc][lc][ld]C[White hanes to keep Black cut off from the M17 group (triangle).]
;B[ob]BL[820.567]C[So I pull back solidly to start making shape.]
;W[mc]WL[1029.343]C[White repairs his cutting shape.]
;B[pa]BL[781.453]C[And then I make living shape.]
;W[sb]WL[997.213]C[White makes a sente hane.]
;B[ra]BL[751.196]C[And with this descent Black has a miai for life at A (O19) and B (R18). However, though Black was successful in living, this is extremely painful because Black had to live in gote.]
;W[fb]WL[971.608]TR[hc][jc][kc][lc][ld]C[And now Black's M17 group (triangle) is practically dead.]
;B[md]BL[735.447]C[Because I was able to read out the lower left, I felt that I would be able to fight my way out of this. The actual truth of it? Well you'll see shortly.]
;W[nd]WL[969.197]C[White connects solidly.]
;B[me]BL[734.274]C[I push through hoping to utilize a double cut aji.]
;W[mf]WL[958.413]C[White blocks.]
;B[lf]BL[730.933]TR[mb][mc][nc][nd][ne]C[And then I go for the double cut thinking I would be able to capture the N18 group (triangle).]
;W[ke]WL[954.358]C[White connects.]
;B[nf]BL[682.507]C[Black cuts again.]
;W[mg]WL[945.394]C[White extends as expected.]
;B[of]BL[681.054]C[And with this connection, it now boils down to a semeai (i.e., capturing race). Let's do a quick analysis though. 

Question: Who has more liberties?]
;W[ic]WL[944.163]LB[mb:1][jc:2]C[Group #1 has 5 liberties while Group #2 only had 4 (from Move 109).]
;B[ib]BL[669.22]C[Unfortunately, I am not reading at this point and am just going on blind faith. The reality of it is that Black is way behind.]
;W[hb]WL[937.919]LB[hc:A]C[White cuts and prevents Black from connecting to A (H17).]
;B[jb]BL[664.942]LB[jb:1][mb:2]C[Again, I am a moron and connect without reading out the situation. Let's do a recap again. It is White's turn. Group #1 still only has 4 liberties while Group #2 has 5 liberties. ]
;W[gc]WL[925.294]LB[gb:A]C[White has to atari here to prevent Black from playing the atari at A (G18).]
;B[lb]BL[662.696]C[I continue to plod along to my road of death, though if I remember correctly, I faintly remember that I'm able to get into a ko fight. Sigh. Too bad I didn't stop to think whether I had any legitimate ko threats.]
;W[ma]WL[915.16]C[White calmly extends to maximize his liberties while keeping Black at 4.]
;B[ha]BL[659.393]C[At this point, I realize I'm in trouble, but I do see a ko at the end of the tunnel. So I go for it.]
;W[gb]WL[901.42]C[White connects solidly to reduce a ko threat.]
;B[na]BL[645.061]TR[na][pa][ra][nb][ob][rb][pc][qc][pd][pe][nf][of][pg][qg]C[I go ahead and reduce White's liberty while gaining one point and permanent life for my Q19 group (triangle).]
;W[ka]WL[839.907]C[White continues to reduce my liberties.]
;B[la]BL[609.407]C[I go ahead and cut off the A (L19) stone while making an eye and preparing for the ko.]
;W[ia]WL[807.715]C[White throws in. At the time, I couldn't see a way out, but Black actually can win the capturing race. I just saw it as I was reviewing this game. GAH!!! *face palm* Click on P17 to see what I mean.]
(;B[ja]BL[587.588]C[I fill my own liberty and allow the ko to happen.]
;W[ga]WL[801.58]C[White prepares to start the ko.]
;B[oc]BL[551.261]C[And I go ahead and reduce one liberty to prepare for the ko fight.]
;W[ia]WL[797.643]C[With that, White starts the ko. 
]
;B[cc]BL[510.076]C[I have a hard time finding a ko threat, so I threaten to destroy White's upper left corner here.]
;W[cd]WL[788.912]C[White responds!]
;B[ha]BL[507.394]C[And so I get to take the ko!]
;W[bk]WL[770.933]C[Except White still has this ko factory. ARGH!!!]
;B[cn]BL[501.369]C[No choice but to respond.]
;W[ia]WL[768.168]C[White takes the ko...]
;B[rr]BL[363.41]C[I'm an idiot. Honestly. White never responded down here before, and he responded in the upper left. Why I thought this would get answered is completely beyond me.]
;W[kb]WL[760.036]C[And White ends the ko as one can expect. UBER OUCH for Black...]
;B[gj]BL[347.268]C[Disheartened by my failed ko, I try to console myself by trying to reduce White's center influence and top left moyo. Although in reality, this is a pitiful reduction move.]
;W[on]WL[756.382]C[When White jumps here, I have to admit I was quite upset. After all, I had spent 3 ko threats down here, and yet White was trying to live? And on top of that, I lost my top group due to these ko threats. ]
;B[ol]BL[340.34]C[Conclusion? I had to kill the entire bottom to salvage the situation.]
;W[qn]WL[742.392]C[White attaches to try and make shape.]
;B[po]BL[318.066]C[I immediately go for the shape point and double peep.]
;W[pn]WL[697.337]LB[oo:A]C[White connects solidly is unfortunately connected. If you think Black can push at A (P5), click P5 to see why Black can't.]
(;B[ro]BL[300.74]C[So I make living shape here with this diagonal.]
;W[rn]WL[664.225]C[White blocks and keeps my group sealed in.]
;B[qo]BL[287.764]LB[oo:A]C[So I connect here to threaten to push at A (P5).]
;W[oo]WL[556.213]C[White connects solidly.]
(;B[sp]BL[283.68]LB[mm:A]C[And then to add on to my stupidity, I add a move to live in gote when I should have just surrounded the group with A (N7). Don't believe me? Go back to Move 144 and click on N7 to see if White can kill the corner.]
;W[mn]WL[533.73]C[Now White uses his chance to break out with an attachment.]
;B[lo]BL[253.971]C[I try to keep solid since I don't see White gaining two eyes.]
;W[ln]WL[521.275]LB[ll:A]C[When White extends here gain, I should have seriously considered A (M8).]
;B[ko]BL[222.064]C[But nope, my stupidity continues and I am epically failing at attacking the White group.]
;W[mk]WL[456.424]C[White gets an easy two point jump, and at this point, Black should probably just resign.]
;B[ml]BL[85.276]C[But I just keep trying to kill him...]
;W[ll]WL[440.964]C[White hanes.]
;B[nm]BL[83.559]C[And then I peep.]
;W[nn]WL[436.519]C[White connects.]
;B[lk]BL[54.714]C[And then I cut because it's do or die for me at this point.]
;W[mm]WL[347.596]C[White makes a nice forcing move with this atari.]
;B[nl]BL[51.475]C[I must connect to keep him separated.]
;W[mj]WL[345.943]LB[kk:A]C[White extends and threatens the lader with A (L9).]
;B[kl]BL[41.086]C[But I go ahead and use my own forcing move.]

;B[kk]BL[30]OB[5]TR[ll][lm][mm][ln][mn][nn][on][pn][qn][rn][oo][op][pq][qq]C[And then I connect. At first glance, it seems like I'm successful since the P5 group (triangle) does not have two eyes, but you'll quickly see how the group is far from dead.]
;W[pl]WL[272.859]C[White's nose attachment here was beautiful but seriously frustrating at the time.]
;B[pk]BL[30]OB[5]LB[ok:A][pm:B]C[The hane was the only option since White cannot cut at A (P9) without getting captured by Black B (Q7).]
;W[ql]WL[247.931]C[White extends.]
