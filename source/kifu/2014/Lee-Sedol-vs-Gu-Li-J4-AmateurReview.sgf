;B[pd]C[Gu Li starts with the star point, which is the most balanced of the opening moves because it doesn't have any biases towards any direction.]
;W[dp]C[Lee Sedol chooses a star point as well but on the mirror side of the board. This eliminates any possibility for a cross fuseki to occur. This is atypical of normal pro games where it is more common to play in the upper left corner.]
;B[qp]LB[qj:A][jq:B]C[Black chooses the 3-4 komoku which is partial to the A (right) side and weaker towards the B (bottom) side. This threatens an orthodox or mini/micro-Chinese fuseki.]
;W[dc]LB[jc:A][cj:B]C[White chooses the empty corner with the 3-4 komoku as well. 

Question: Based on what was stated in the last move, which side is stronger and which side is weaker between A (top) and B (left).]
;B[fq]LB[jc:A][cj:B]C[Answer: The A (top) side is stronger while the B (left) side is weaker.

Black makes a normal approach move to probe White's intentions.]
;W[cn]LB[hq:A][iq:B]C[This is a calm response that generally aims to take sente. If White wanted to be more proactive and complicate things, A (H3) or B (J3) are common options to do so.]
;B[lq]LB[qf:A][qj:B]C[Black then sets up the micro-Chinese opening (which is very popular currently).

Normal moves at this point for White are either A (R14) or B (R10).]
;W[pm]LB[de:D][pj:C][qj:A][op:B]C[This is not a normal move against the micro-chinese, but White wanted to avoid playing a normal move like A (Q10). So this move switches up the game and makes it a little different.

This move is normally seen against the Chinese Opening, and the general responses to this move are generally B (P4) [which is calm\] an C (Q10) [which is looking for a fight\]. 

Some players might think that a move like D (D15) is big, but it doesn't really work because White can reapproach the lower right corner which will allow him to take the initiative in an area where Black was originally strong.

Let's see what Gu Li chooses.]
;B[pj]LB[pm:A]C[True to his style, Gu Li chooses the fighting route! This is the most aggressive move that aims to keep pressure on the A (Q7) stone.]
;W[pp]C[White's attachment here is someting I've never seen before, but the idea is to attach to Black's stone to gain strength to gain sabaki (i.e., eye potential).]
;B[pq]LB[po:A]C[Though the hane at A seems more aggressive, this hane prevents White from descending to the third line and possibly establishing a base. In addition, it starts to make some territory for Black while attacking White.]
;W[oq]TR[pq]C[White hanes as well to keep his shape light and flexible. This is a normal follow-up to the Q3 (triangle) hane.]
;B[po]LB[op:A]C[Though many might be tempted to atari at A (P4) instead, Black's atari here is better since it makes territory while keeping Black's group well connected. In addition, cutting at A (P4) would allow White to take the corner.]
;W[op]C[White connects in order to prevent Black from gaining a powerful ponnuki this early in the game.]
;B[qq]C[And then Black connects solidly to remove his cutting point while keeping pressure on the White group.]
;W[oo]LB[qo:A]TR[po]C[White then extends to threaten the cut at A (R5) which would ladder the Q5 stone (triangle) to the upper left (which is in White's favor at the moment).]
;B[pn]LB[qn:A]C[This move goes against the proverb of not "butting one's head against your opponent's stone," but it is the only move in this scenario because it gains Black territory while putting pressure on White.

If Black simply played the passive tiger's mouth at A (R6), then White could atari and at Q6 to keep Black down on the third line while having good shape.]
;W[on]C[White extends to keep Black from easily cutting his groups apart.]
;B[om]LB[qm:A]C[Black then cuts once for aji and is the more active move as opposed to the more passive move of A (R7) because Black is stronger in this area.]
;W[rn]LB[qo:A]C[White jumps here to threaten the atari at A (R5).]
;B[qm]C[Black then ataris here.]
;W[pl]C[White has no choice but to extend.]
;B[ql]LB[ol:A]TR[pl][pm]C[Black extends once more and threatens to capture the Q7 stones (triangle) with A (P8) while also connecting his stones up.]
;W[ol]C[So White turns to prevent that.]
;B[qk]LB[nm:A]C[And then Black extends once more to gain a solid 16-17 points of territory, which is sente because Black can then extend to A (O7) and split White into two weak groups.]
;W[nm]TR[lq]C[White captures the cutting stone in order to prevent Black from running it out later on.

At this point, it feels like Black is better off than White because White's thickness is being negated by the M3 (triangle) stone. In addition, because Black has sente, it's hard to see how White will use his thickness to properly compensate for all the territory Black got on the right.]
;B[ip]TR[ol][pl][nm][pm][on][oo][op][pp][oq]C[As expected, Black then plays a defensive move with good shape to prevent White from being able to properly use his thickness at P4 (triangle).]
;W[ce]C[White then calmly takes the corner with this shimari, which seems a little slow, but this is necessary because White must restore the balance of territory.]
;B[ic]LB[jc:1][kc:2][lc:3][mc:4][nc:5][oc:6]C[As I expected, Black makes the 6 space extension here to negate the power of White's shimari. In addition, this 6 space extension invites fighting on the top. 

If you don't like fighting though, the 5 space extension at K17 is recommended instead.

Overall, it feels like Black's play has had better flow this game.]
;W[nc]LB[qf:A]TR[ic]C[I was a little surprised to see White invade like this, but the other option A (R14) doesn't seem very attractive either. So I guess White had no choice but to invade here.

Question: With the J17 stone (triangle) in place, what's the first move that should come to your mind?]
;B[oc]C[Correct! The kick is the first thing you should think of when you have a pincer stone already.]
;W[nd]C[White stands up.]
;B[pf]C[And then Black jumps once on the fourth line. Black's position on the right is looking mighty nice now.]
;W[kc]C[White can extend two spaces to make a base, but this is a bit narrow considering White prefers a three space extension from his two stone wall.]
;B[fc]C[And then Black has just enough room to make his own two-space extension! So again, it feels like Black is in control of this game so far.]
;W[gd]LB[gc:A]C[White tries to start the peep and attach joseki against the two space extension.*

*If you don't know what I'm talking about, click on A (G17).]
(;B[db]LB[dc:A][kc:B]C[Though part of me was surprised to see this, another part of me was like, "You really expected Gu Li to play the normal move when he's pincered on both sides at A (D17) and B (L17)?" And then I thought, "Yeah nevermind. What was I thinking?"

This is a probe move to see what White wants to do.]
;W[cb]C[White hanes to start making territory in the corner while keeping Black weak.]
;B[dd]LB[eb:A][gc:B]C[The natural instinct for some players might have been to pull back at A (E18) or even return to the attach and extend joseki at B (G17), but Black then plays this beautiful clamp.]
;W[cc]C[White connects to remove his cutting points and is the only move to prevent Black from gaining any forcing moves.]
;B[gc]C[And now Black connects up his stones after those exchanges.]
;W[id]C[White attaches to smother.]
;B[fd]LB[hd:A]TR[dd]C[But with the D16 (triangle) exchange, Black can omit the normal move of A (H16) in order to gain access to the center.]
;W[hd]LB[hc:A]C[I was a little surprised to see White connect here, but it seems that it was to gain sente because it threatens the push and cut at A (H17) and keeps his stone solidly connected.]
;B[hc]C[Black connects solidly and should have no problem living anymore.]
(;W[jd]C[This move might seem slow to you, but it's actually a key shape point for White that he must protect unless he wants to let Black split him into two weak groups. To see what I mean, go back to Move 45 and click on D10.]
;B[ff]LB[df:A]C[Since Black is not yet alive, jumping out the center is natural and also simultaneously negating White's center potential. In addition, a move like A (D14) instead is not as good since it reduces Black's potential to invade or reduce the left side later on (since it forces White to take profit along the side).]
;W[df]LB[cd:A]C[This move might seem slow, but it's powerful and minimizes any aji that could be created from the push at A (C16). ]
;B[fh]C[Black jumps out again to further negate any center potential that White has while also giving himself more space for eyes in the event he needs it.

Based on the current board position, I'd have to say I would prefer Black in this case.]
;W[qc]C[This is an interesting time for White to invades the 3-3 as a probe to see what Black's intentions are and to leave aji for later on.]
;B[pc]C[Black defends the corner and keeps the White stone separated.]
;W[dh]C[White's jump here is a little surprising to me, but it's necessary because the left side is White's main area of profit and he cannot allow Black to easily walk in to destroy it.]
;B[ih]TR[kc][nc][gd][hd][id][jd][nd]C[So Black jumps out into the center for flexible shape while putting pressure on the K16 group (triangle).]
;W[ej]C[White continues his attack while trying to build the left.]
;B[lg]LB[pf:4][lg:3][fh:1][ih:2]C[This might seem odd, but Black's large knight's move gives him a good follow up at A (M16) while also making it easier for him to connect back to his allies on the right if needed later on.

For White, in order to figure out what's the best way to try and cut through, you'll see that the space between 3 (M13) and 4 (Q14) has the widest space.]
;W[ng]C[White jumps in at the point of symmetry to separate Black.]
;B[ld]C[Black's move here is very sharp and pokes at White's shape point.]
;W[nb]C[White descends to keep his groups connected while aiming for some possible aji in the upper right corner.]
;B[ne]LB[ld:A]TR[ng]C[Black then attaches in order to separate the O13 stone (triangle) from the two space jump. A beautiful follow up from A (M16).]
;W[me]C[White hanes to try and connect his stones.]
;B[nf]LB[md:A][mg:B]TR[pd][pf]C[Black descends. And though this is butting the heads of two stones against the wall, which is against the traditional go proverb, it works in this situation because White has two cutting points (A [N16\] + B [N13\]) and the support of the markd stones (triangle).]
;W[le]TR[ld]C[White cuts off the M16 stone (triangle).]
;B[nk]LB[ni:A][nl:C][om:B]C[This move might seem innocuous, but it helps to expand Black's territory around A (O11) while also putting pressure on the wall by threatening to falsify the eye at B (P7) later on with C (O8).]
;W[qe]C[White plays at another shape point to see how Black will respond.]
;B[qd]C[Black keeps the stones firmly separated.]
;W[mf]LB[qe:B][ng:A]C[While the empty triangle here seems odd, it threatens to connect to A (O13) while also aiming to utilize the aji of B (R15).]
;B[qf]LB[qe:A]C[Black chooses to take secure profit and eliminates the aji of A (R15).]
;W[mg]C[White connects and prevents Black from sealing him from the center. The result to here is very successful for White.]
;B[lm]LB[nk:A]TR[ol][pl][nm][pm][on][oo][op][pp][oq]C[Black now takes the initiative to attack White's P3 group (triangle) which is not yet alive which keeps consistency with the A (O9) stone.]
;W[lo]C[White fights back with this jump that makes some eye space]
;B[ko]C[Black attaches to connect his stones up while maintaining pressure on White.]
;W[lp]C[White descends to threaten to separate the Black stones while continuing to make eye space for life.]
;B[kp]C[Black blocks.]
;W[mq]C[White hanes on the inside in order to continue making eye shape.]
;B[lr]C[Black descends to (1) prevent from giving White any cutting aji, (2) maintains silent pressure on White, and (3) starts to solidify the bottom territory.]
;W[eq]LB[fp:A]C[White kicks to take the corner territory to overconcentrate, but with White's moyo potential on the left, maybe A (F4) would have been more interesting.]
;B[fp]C[Black stands up to prevent White from gaining center influence and build additional territory.]
;W[em]C[White raises his framework to the 5th line with this move and also helps to negate some of Black's center potential.]
;B[er]C[Black hanes under to reduce White's corner.]
;W[dr]C[White blocks to prevent Black from further intruding on his corner.]
;B[fr]C[Black connects solidly to maximize his territory on the bottom.]
;W[fl]LB[jb:A]TR[db][fc][gc][hc][ic][dd][fd][ff][lg][fh][ih]C[This move was surprising to me because it felt very slow and did not seem to gain White very much. If I had to guess though, White wanted to play solidly while negating Black's influence in the center since he must have felt he was ahead. 

A move like A (K18) seems to take more initiative since it threatens to take away Black's base and allows White to start an attack on the J17 group (triangle).]
;B[dn]C[Black's attachment here is a great tesuji to reduce White's territory. Don't forget, attaching where your opponents are strong does not do much harm.]
;W[co]C[White pulls back solidly to protect his territory.]
;B[kb]LB[jb:A]C[Black attaches to expand his territory while preventing the big reduction move of White A (K18). It seems that Black has started taking the lead at this point.]
;W[lb]C[White peacecfully hanes on the outside to secure his own group.]
;B[jb]C[Black pulls back solidly and has settled his top group quite nicely.]
;W[na]LB[qb:A]C[This move bewildered me intiially, but it aims at the desecent of A (R18) to connect his stones and severely reduce Black's corner.]
;B[pa]LB[qc:A][qd:B]C[However, it induces Black to reinforce his corner which practically removes the aji of A (R17) and B (R15) entirely.]
;W[pg]C[White starts reducing Black's right side.]
;B[qg]C[Black turns to prevent Black from reducing his right side any more.]
;W[ph]C[White extends to continue reducing Black's territory.]
;B[qh]C[Black extends solidly to keep making territory.]
;W[pi]C[White extends once again.]
;B[qi]C[And Black extends as well to connect his stones up with no shape defects.]
;W[eb]TR[jb][kb][fc][gc][hc][ic][dd][fd][ff][lg][fh][ih]C[White now embarks to reduce Black's top territory while threatening to possibly destabilize the J17 group (triangle).]
;B[if]LB[fb:A]TR[na][lb][nb][kc][nc][gd][hd][id][jd][nd][le][me][mf][mg][ng][pg][ph][pi]C[Some might be tempted to block at A (F18), but that would be giving White the initiative. Bllack's jump here makes his center influence stronger and starts reducing White's K16 group's (triangle) eye space (since it's not fully alive yet).]
;W[ge]C[Though it it an empty triangle, White pokes out Black's eye shape while threatening to cut at the same time.]
;B[ef]C[Black extends in good shape to keep his stones connected.]
;W[hg]C[White peeps at Black's shape.]
;B[eh]LB[hf:A][di:B]TR[hg]C[Though I would have been tempted try cutting at A (H14), Black is rather thin. As a result, the H13 stone (triangle) is not as easily captured as it may seem. Black's bump here is a nice way to solidify his own connections while simultaneously threatening to reduce White's left side with a move like B (D11).]
;W[di]C[White protects his left side.]
;B[hh]C[And then Black connects in great shape.]
;W[gg]LB[gh:A]C[White repairs his own connection while threatening to push and cut at A (G12).]
;B[gh]C[Black connects solidly.]
;W[ln]LB[kn:A]C[White extends to threaten to come out at A (L6).]
;B[kn]C[Black blocks while building more influence and some territory.]
;W[mm]C[White's extension here maximizes his territory while preventing Black from sente reduction that would threaten the livelihood of this group.]
;B[li]LB[ll:A]TR[jb][kb][fc][gc][hc][ic][dd][fd][ef][ff][if][lg][eh][fh][gh][hh][ih]C[Black's jump here is to start linking his groups up together so that White cannot harrass the K18 group (triangle) by cutting it off and threatening its eye space.

Some players might have followed up with an extension at A (M8), but it doesn't make much profit and do much for Black, so the one point jump here is much more useful.]
;W[ll]C[White's atari here may seem small.]
;B[km]C[But Black needs to respond in order to prevent White from gaining a ponnuki in the center, which would significantly reduce Black's potential for territory in the center.]
;W[mr]C[White descends to expand his eye space and prevent Black from calling the group's livelihood into question.]
;B[fk]C[Black's attachment here is another brilliant reduction because White does not have an active way to respond to this while gaining anything significant. ]
;W[gk]LB[ek:A]C[White takes the proactive move and hanes on the outside instead of the simple block at A (E9).]
;B[fj]C[Black extends to prevent his reduction stone from getting captured.]
;W[ek]C[White blocks to prevent Black from reducing his left side any more.]
;B[gl]C[Black can now cut and continue trying to gain some territory in the center.]
;W[gm]LB[gk:A]C[White ataris from the outside since running out the A (G9) stone would be catastrophic and most likely unsuccessful.]
;B[hl]LB[ij:A]SQ[hi][ii][ji][ki][gj][hj][jj][hk][ik]C[Black extends and you can start to see territory forming in the A (J10) area (marked by squares).]
;W[en]LB[dm:B][eo:A]C[White comes down here now to capture the A (D6) reduction stone and further expand his left side. Though it seems small, it prevents the sente at A (E5) which would threaten the push at B (D7). So it's a reverse sente move in a sense.]
;B[hm]C[Black turns to continue expanding his center potential.]
;W[or]LB[rs:A]TR[ol][pl][mm][nm][pm][ln][on][lo][oo][lp][op][pp][mq][oq][mr][or]C[White descends and threatens to jump into Black's corner with a move like A (S1). It also ensures that Black cannot do anything to harrass the life of the P2 group (triangle).]
;B[pr]C[Black blocks in order to prevent such a large scale reduction.]
;W[kf]LB[ke:A]C[White now tries to reduce some of Black's center potential while starting to gain some territory around A (L15).]
;B[gn]LB[in:A]C[Black's atari here might seem small, but it helps to grow the A (J6) area.]
;W[kk]C[White's kosumi here reduces Black's center potential.]
;B[ig]LB[if:A]C[Black connects his stones to prevent White from cutting through and making sizable territory in the A (J15) area.]
;W[jj]LB[kh:A]C[White plays another solid diagonal to reduce Black's territory in this area to only a few points now and threaten to cut the Black group apart with a move like A (L12).]
;B[oi]LB[og:A]C[Black's hane here threatens the capture with A (P13).]
;W[gj]TR[pg][ph][pi]C[White does not want to save his Q13 stones (triangle) in gote and finds this sente atari to further reduce Black's center area.]
;B[fi]TR[gj][gk]C[Black connects solidly because he can still capture the G10 stones (triangle) if White tenukis.]
;W[ik]C[White connects his stones together to eliminate Black's territory in the center.]
;B[fm]TR[fl]C[Black captures a stone and threatens to further reduce White's left by capturing the F8 (triangle) stone.]
;W[el]LB[og:B][kh:A]C[White connects solidly, but it seems that taking gote for this seems small. However, White connects here in order to make a miai for cutting Black apart at A (L12) or capturing the stones at B (P13).]
;B[mj]LB[ml:A]C[This connection here might seem harmless and slow, but it aims at the A (N8) cutting point.]
;W[mk]C[White protects his cutting point.]
;B[og]TR[jb][kb][fc][gc][hc][ic][dd][fd][ef][ff][if][ig][pg][eh][fh][gh][hh][ih][ph][fi][pi][fj][fk]C[Black then returns to firmly capture the three stones (triangle) and gain six more points. This is powerful because it states that Black believes he can live on the top without any help from his allies.

This move is only advised if you are strong in your life and death skills and do not fear your J14 group (triangle) dying at the top.]
;W[kh]C[With this move, Black is now cut off (as you'll see shortly).]
;B[lh]C[Black connects solidly.]
;W[kg]LB[ih:1][li:2]C[White also connects solidly to keep that Black groups separated.]
;B[ki]C[Black pushes to threaten to connect.]

;B[gf]C[Remember, always look for ways to be proactive. And this move here threatens to make an eye by capturing the H13 group (triangle) while also reducing points for White.]
;W[hf]C[White does not want Black to gain easy life, so he escapes.]
