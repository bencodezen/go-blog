GN[World Go Championship 2018 Final]PW[Park Jeong-Hwan]PB[Iyama Yuta]WR[9p]BR[9p]EV[World Go Championship 2018]C[This is the first time I have ever live-streamed a pro game and it's pretty exciting for it to be between two titans!

Contrary to some of my previous game reviews, I'll be writing my thoughts along the way which means I have no idea what is going to happen nor have I had the chance to be influenced by any other pro reviews. 

Hope you enjoy!]
;B[qd]C[I've been catching up recently on the developments in the go world, and it seems like there is a "new territorial" style that is becoming popular. I wonder whether Black will play it.]
;W[pp]C[Star point. Flexible and also oriented toward a possible influence style this game.]
;B[cd]C[I was surprised to see a 3-4 here on this side since this gives a clear intention of Black to develop the sides (left and/or right) and leave the top as a "to be determined" type of area.]
;W[dp]C[Ninrensei (two stars). Definitely familiar with this approach and it provides White speed and flexibility if desired.]
;B[oc]C[Having read about the recent development in the go trend, I was surprised to see the one space enclosure which seems to be inefficient after AlphaGo. However, perhaps Black has his own plans for this game.]
;W[ed]C[High approach to the only corner Black has not yet enclosed. No surprises here.]
;B[ec]C[This attachment allows for a potential avalanche joseki, but also allows White to choose the hane joseki which typically leaves Black with sente.]
;W[fc]C[White hanes here which seems to indicate a desire to make something of the top at some point.]
;B[dc]C[Black extends as expected to keep his stones connected.]
;W[qe]LB[fd:A]C[White then tenukis (which is okay but leaves the obvious cutting point at A) to take sente and more importantly, probe what Black's intentions are here in the corner. 

Normally the advice is not to attach to stones randomly because it strengthens your opponent, but since Black is already strong here in the corner, White is not violating the basic principle that we're often taught early on.]
;B[pe]C[Hane to put pressure on the stone.]
;W[qf]LB[pd:A]C[Extends calmly to possibly exploit the cut at A for aji later on.]
;B[pd]LB[pf:A]C[Black connects instead of following at A (Q14) which I was surprised by, but this does seem consistent with Black's desire to maintain strong groups on the board with little weakness.]
;W[qi]C[Two space extension to settle White's group.]
;B[hc]C[Very strong pincer to put pressure on White's stones.]
;W[he]TR[fc][ed]C[White jumps very lightly here which seems to indicate that White intends on treating the triangle stones (E16 and F17) lightly.]
;B[fe]LB[fd:A][gd:B]C[Elephant jump to threaten the cutting points of A (F16) and B (G16).]
;W[nq]C[I was quite surprised by this move because it seems like White is in dire straights on the top, but at the same time, this is consistent with White's light play and focus on more whole board startegy. As it is obvious at this point, Black has spent the first 19 moves of this game entirely focused on the top half of the board while White has stones throughout the whole board.

It'll be interesting to see how Black handles White's whole board synergy at this point!]
;B[fd]C[Black does not seem interested in White's tenuki at this time. The cut clearly indicates that he intends to make his groups strong and ready for whatever shenanigans he has planned for the future. In other words, he does not want to leave weak groups exposed for White to attack and make territory with at the same time.]
;W[cj]C[Wow! White is just taking all the big points on the board. It seems crazy to think that we're 20 moves in and Black still only has stones in the top portion of the board.]
;B[fq]C[Black finally approached! ]
;W[dn]C[The one space high jump is expected as it works well with the C10 stone.]
;B[jp]C[Though this may seem odd because White is already sort of undercutting Black with O3, this is a flexible shape for Black since Black does not necessarily know how to settle just yet.]
;W[ip]LB[hp:A][hq:B]C[Another probe attachment by White here. This does seem a bit more odd to be since Black is weak and this will allow Black to gain sabaki (i.e., eye shape) as a result. A normal move might be like A (H4) oir B (H3). Perhaps this could be viewed as a fighting move?]
;B[iq]C[Hane under to try and connect to the F3 stone.]
;W[hq]C[Hane to prevent an easy connection.]
;B[hp]C[Atari is the obvious choice here since White exposed the cutting point.]
;W[io]C[White stands since simply letting Black capture here is too good for Black.]
;B[hr]C[So Black gets to capture the H3 stone.]
;W[jq]TR[jp]C[But sure enough, White is cutting on the other side with what seems like an intention to grip the K3 stone.]
;B[gq]LB[gn:B][dr:A][jr:C]C[Black takes the stone and has a more or less stable group at this point with multiple options for the group.]
;W[ir]C[To my surprise, White has no intention of letting Black settle that easily and is already ready to fight a ko!]
;B[kq]C[Black is clearly not one to back down from a fight. So this atari signals that the ko fight is to begin!]
;W[hq]C[With this capture, it's on Black to find the first ko threat.]
;B[dq]C[Though not a ko threat in the traditional sense of "I'm going to kill this if you don't response," this move is a ko threat because it threatens to take the entire corner away from White with C4 if White does not respond.]
;W[cq]C[White naturally blocks.]
;B[iq]C[And now it's White's turn to find a ko threat! If I had to guess where the next ko threat would be, I'd be looking at the aji in the upper left corner.]
;W[jr]C[Alas, White must not think the upper right has a move threatening enough for Black to respond to, so White calmly connects.]
;B[cr]C[Black hanes to further settle his group.]
;W[cp]LB[eq:B][dr:A]C[White connects solidly which threatens a future atari at A (D2) or B (E3) if desired later on.]
;B[er]C[Staying consistent with the theme of solid groups, Black settles his group and is pretty much fully alive at this point.]
;W[qo]TR[io][ip][jq][ir][jr]C[White's play here is just another indication of whole board thinking since the initial move that one would think White would want to play is to somehow settle the marked stones in the K3 area. Clearly this move is bigger than settling those stones at this time. ]
;B[dm]C[And now Black is going to play an attachment of his own!]
;W[dl]C[There's a proverb that when an opponent attaches, you hane; so this clamp was a little surprising to me.]
;B[kr]LB[cg:A][ng:B]C[And then Black ignores it! Well the bottom is clearly Black's now unless White wants to save the stones with a ko fight, but it doesn't see valuable to do that at this time. Based on White's play thus far, my guess is that the biggest areas would be A (C13) or B (O13).]
;W[em]C[Whelp. I was wrong. Settling this area with this atari is White's priority at this time.]
;B[jo]C[While this move appears to be local, it is important to note that it impacts White's moyo potential in the center by standing up.]
;W[jn]C[Not surprisingly, White hanes on top of the top stones to prevent Black from easily waltzing into the center.]
;B[mq]C[Looks like Black wants to continue gaining more strength to eat into White's framework.]
;W[mp]C[White's hane here is the right direction since it continues to work with the rest of his stones which are emphasizing influence.]
;B[lp]C[Black takes the critical shape point.]
;W[mo]C[White stands to protect the cut at O4 while continuing to grow his influence.]
;B[lo]C[Black follows to prevent White from easily sealing him in.]
;W[mn]C[White extends solidly to prevent Black getting any easy cutting points.]
;B[in]C[Black cuts here now to prevent White from connecting and then possibly starting a dangerous ko for Black that would leave his L2 group left to fend for itself if White wins.]
;W[ho]C[White is not going to make it easy for Black to capture. So White extends to continue making use of the stone's aji.]
;B[hn]C[Black continues the atari.]
;W[go]C[White naturally extends and is almost connected with his allies on the left.]
;B[jm]C[Black now ataris here to strengthen his J6 stones.]
;W[jc]TR[jm][hn][in]C[This is utterly surprising for me since I would think that White would want to save the cutting stone, but this just goes to show how localized my strategy is with go. 

White is playing here because the top is big and has a fair amount of potential for Black. On the other hand, White's potential for the center is more or less gone at this point since Black is quite strong and has a fair amount of influence radiating out into the center which means that creating a weak group wouldn't do White much good at this point.]
;B[je]LB[lc:A]C[I don't think I've ever seen two elephant jumps played right after one after another. It seems so odd since the obvious answer would be for White to play J16 to connect his stones and separate Black. However, this would make White heavy and this is probably what Black is inviting.

My guess for the next move is that White will try to make a flexible base with something like A (M17).]
;W[cg]C[I'm wrong yet again. Though I'm proud that I predicted this move earlier on, it's just the timing was slightly off. 

That said, this is actually very consistent with White's play of treating stones lightly and taking strategic points before committing heavily to an area.]
;B[dh]LB[ch:A]C[Black threatens to press down which normally induces A (C12).]
;W[gc]C[But to my surprise yet again, White is ready to start to use his stones to make some shenanigans happen! In case it's not obvious, this makes miai of connecting to White's allies at H15 or K17.]
;B[ic]C[Black chooses to isolate the K17 stones which makes sense since Black could potentially turn that area in territory.]
;W[gd]C[So now White's stones are connected and a little heavy, so it'll be interesting to see how White plans to settle this group since Black now has a target to attack.]
;B[jd]C[Black strengthens his stones while quelling the danger of K17's aji being used against him.]
;W[ff]C[This tesuji here is brilliant by White's part since it makes full use of the aji at E16.]
;B[ee]C[Black naturally cannot let White save the E16 stone.]
;W[ef]C[White can extend once more to threaten a D15 atari.]
;B[de]C[So Black extends once more to prevent White from moulding him into a lump of stones.]
;W[gf]C[This move appears to connect White's stones together, but a simple reading would show that Black can easily separate the stones if desired, but perhaps White's purpose back with G17 was to gain this wall in order to grow his left area potential.]
;B[ch]C[Black has no intention of handing the left side to White, so the descent is a natural move to resist this.]
;W[df]C[So White connects his stones from this side instead.]
;B[dj]C[Black attaches to make shape.]
;W[dk]C[White extends to solidify more territory while removing a liberty from Black.]
;B[bh]C[Black descent here fully disconnects the White stones and also undercuts White from gaining an easy base.]
;W[jb]LB[id:A]TR[hc][ic]C[White's extension here goes to show how the move at K16 only did so much and why it's so hard to remove the aji of a stone. If you can't see it, the threat is the cut of A (J16) which would threaten the capture of the J17 stones.]
;B[id]C[So Black must make this very ugly shape to prevent the cut.]
;W[be]C[The knight's jump here gives White some eye shape, but it's main purpose seems to limit Black's ability to gain points in this area since it is very easy to break the eye.]
;B[ce]C[Black threatens to capture the B15 stone.]
;W[cf]C[This solid connection is a little ugly since it forms an empty triangle, but it does the trick of protecting the cut while giving the White the potential of making one eye here.]
;B[ej]TR[bh][ch][dh][dj]C[Black's marked stones (D12) are now weak and in jepordy of being attacked, so now Black must escape into the center to find safety.]
;W[gj]C[Now you can see how White's thickness on the top is a massive wall with this cap. Black's group seems so heavy.]
;B[bj]C[Black clamps to try and make some shape.]
;W[bk]C[White blocks Black from gaining more eye space.]
;B[ci]C[This move tries to gain one eye for Black.]
;W[fh]LB[ck:A]C[Ths instinctive move would be to connect at A (C9), but White seals Black in with this move and Black's group is looking dangerously on the verge of dying.]
;B[ck]C[Black naturally captures now.]
;W[bl]C[But White can just calmly pull back and Black is hard pressed for two eyes.]
;B[hg]C[Black attemps to counter attack by threatening to possibly start a capturing race with the White group, but this seems terribly obvious.]
;W[ge]C[White connects solidly and I don't think there's any question of who has more liberties now.]
;B[bd]C[Black blocks the White group from gaining an eye here.]
;W[if]C[So White pokes through Black's connection to edge into the center.]
;B[kg]C[Black tries to setup a net for White while growing his top right potential.]
;W[jg]C[But Black is much to thin to contain White, so White attaches to threaten Black to try and box him in.]
;B[jh]C[Black hanes to contain White.]
;W[kh]C[White crosscuts to see what Black values.]
;B[ji]C[Keeping White contained seems like Black's intention here.]
;W[kf]C[So White gets this atari for free.]
;B[lg]C[Black naturally extends.]
;W[jf]C[And with this connection, White is now running into Black's thickness on top which seems to be Black's plan with the initial "net".]
;B[lc]C[Black wants to make it impossible for White to gain eyes.]
;W[ld]C[But those stones at K18 still got a lot of aji and White wastes no time exploiting that with this attachment.]
;B[kc]C[So Black must continue to try and quell the aji. Notice that White has only played two stones in this area, but Black has had to invest 7 stones so far and there is still more aji yet to exploit. Ouch.]
;W[mc]C[Oh man. So much aji...]
;B[mb]C[Black hanes under and it's just looking bad for Black.]
;W[gl]C[White surprisingly tenukis at this seemingly critical point since White has no eyes to speak of at this point, but what it does have is a ton of liberties. And if you don't have eyes, another way to make your group live is to kill something else...]
;B[gi]C[Black attaches to try and make something happen.]
;W[fi]C[But White is having none of that and cuts the stones immediately.]
;B[fj]C[Black cuts.]
;W[hj]LB[gl:A]C[But White just calmly extends and with the help of A (G8), Black has nowhere to go from here.]
;B[hi]C[Black extends to keep his stones connected while keeping the top group cut off from the center stones.]
;W[ei]C[But this move makes it very clear that White is about to kill Black. In fact, I'm pretty sure it's already dead.]
;B[gg]C[Black threatens to cut off the F12 stones.]
;W[fg]C[White just connects solidly because the Black group at E10 is a goner.]
;B[ag]LB[ae:A][bf:B]C[Black threatens the connection at A (A15) or cut at B (B14).]
;W[bf]C[But White just calmly connects and Black has nothing.]
;B[ai]C[Black then makes an eye but it's so easy to falsify the eye with B13. Was this inviting the obligatory killing move before resigning?]
;W[lf]C[White shockingly just walks away. This must be White's way of saying, "Go ahead, I am so far ahead that I will let you save your group in gote." ]
;B[mg]C[Black is still trying to resist, but it seems futile.]
;W[bg]C[So White just kills the group outright.]
;B[fk]C[Black threatens to push and cut.]
;W[hl]C[But White will not be having any of that.]
;B[fl]C[Black pushes again.]
;W[fm]LB[gm:A][gn:B]C[White blocks here and is not worried about the cut at A (G7) since White can capture it with B (G6).]
;B[gn]TR[gj][hj][gl][hl]C[So Black now threatens the cutting point to separate the White stones.]
;W[kj]LB[gm:A]TR[gg][hg][jh][gi][hi][ji]SQ[gj][hj][gl][hl]C[Even though White could defend at A (G7) directly, White counter attacks and threatens to capture the Black stones if Black really wants to cut the White stones off.

And with that, Black resigns since the game is lost.])
