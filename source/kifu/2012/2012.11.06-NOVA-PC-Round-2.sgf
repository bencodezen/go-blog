;B[fd]C[Up to this point, I'd played a lot of random moves that seem leaves me with a bunch of weak groups. If you thought this was bad... it's starts to get worse from this point on.]
;W[cm]C[This was SUPER overplay. It only works on the notion that Black tenukis. See variation.]

Stupid... stupid... stupid..]

At this point though, the computer actually says that I'm ahead by a little bit. So it wasn't as bad as I thought, but at this point I was so blown and started to play super desperately and was on the verge of resignation.]

;B[ip]C[Miraculously, he thought I had something else planned, and let the groups connect. In reality though, my group should've died.]
;W[ho]
;B[em]
;W[dn]C[At this point, I could only brief a sigh of relief that my center white group was alive. From this point on, my goal was to just play solidly since I was pretty sure my lead could not be eliminated through endgame plays.]
