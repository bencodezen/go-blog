;B[pj]C[Still experimenting with the sanrensei as you can see...]
;W[ce]
;B[mc]LB[jd:A][fq:B]C[Yuan Zhou: This is inconsistent with the sanrensei concept of quick development. A and B are better choices for this opening.

Rationale: I recently went over one of Lee Sedol's game, and this was the move he used to negate the influence of the D17 shimari, so I copied his move. See variation for the position that I mocked.]

;B[cr]C[Although Yuan Zhou told me that this was fine for Black, I feel that this territorial variation is still contrary to the sanrensei development.]
;W[co]
;B[bo]
;W[dn]
;B[dm]LB[bn:B][bp:A]C[This is clear overplay. 

Rationale: I read out the White cut at A working out in Black's favor since Black would play B in response.... I forgot that White can also cut at B instead. Haha.]
;W[cm]C[White doesn't see this and let's Black get away with his overplay.]

;W[jc]
;B[je]TR[dm][fm]C[Although this seems to look nice in regards to Black's framework, I think that it is more urgent for me to help out the triangled stones.]
;W[re]C[I know I hate this move because I'm unfamiliar with it and have seen it work against me multiple times, but still, I hate this move. >.<]
;B[qf]LB[rd:A]C[The idea here was to press White down and build a moyo in the center. A would probably have been better since it allows me to attack White better.]
;W[qc]C[White gets easy life this way.]

;B[gk]LB[fj:A][ek:B]C[BAD BAD BAD. This only helps White gets stronger, A or B would be the proper respone.]
