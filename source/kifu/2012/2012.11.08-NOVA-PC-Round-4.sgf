;B[go]
;W[gn]C[Ah... out in the open with great shape. ]
;B[ho]
;W[hq]C[I feel like this was overplay, however, I think I had anticipated just harrassing the group and establishing a base if he tried to attack the stone.]
(;B[gp]C[I think the variation would have been better and more severe on White.]
;W[kq]
;B[mq]C[Double singed formation with large knight moves? I have one response for that.]
;W[qq]
;B[dl]C[The fact that Black tenuki'd surprised me at first. But I couldn't figure out a good way to punish his tenuki, so I went ahead and defended properly.]
;W[em]
;B[ch]C[Great move on Black's part. I was sad to see him reinforce.]
;W[hc]LB[ko:A]C[So I decide to invade here, but I really think I should have played A instead.]
;B[jc]
;W[ko]C[And then I promptly leave my invasion stone alone to jump out... such bad play on my part... sigh.]

(;W[ik]
;B[gi]
;W[fi]
;B[fh]
