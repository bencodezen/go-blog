(;W[cl]
;B[bp]LB[fp:A][fq:B]C[I thought this was an odd move since this is normally the move played after White jumps at either A or B in an effort to establish a base/make White a little more concentrated. (See variation at Move 5).]
;W[dn]C[I thought I would go ahead and try to benefit from his deviation.]
;B[cq]C[You would like the corner? No problem! I'll take a wall in exchange for that.]

;W[el]C[It's like Kageyama says, professionals don't even think about leaving this kind of aji for later. One move net removes all aji and prepares for a stronger offense.]
;B[ci]
;W[cf]
;B[df]
;W[ce]LB[cc:A]C[In hindsight, this move is probably far from correct.  I think the better option would have been just to dive in at A. What do you think?]
;B[de]C[See? Now my move looks stupid. Haha.]
;W[cg]
;B[dg]
;W[cc]
;B[cd]
;W[bd]
;B[dc]
(;W[bc]LB[cb:A]C[I thought about extending at A instead, but past experience of getting double cut scared me into playing more solid. See variation at Move 37 for what I thought would happen (which actually wouldn't if White plays correclty).]
;B[cb]C[Black takes advantage to press me down.]
;W[bb]
;B[db]
;W[bi]TR[bb][bc][cc][bd][ce][cf][cg]C[This move is small in hindsight, doesn't earn White very much since the triangled group should already be resilient to any kill move.]
;B[ch]
;W[bh]
;B[bj]C[This was not only a small move for Black, but it also doesn't work.]
;W[cj]
;B[bk]
;W[ck]SQ[bj][bk]C[Square stones should be dead by my reading.]
;B[di]LB[ei:A]C[No reason for black to play the empty triangle. The one point jump at A would've sufficed and been more effective.]
;W[eh]C[I wanted to take advantage of the shape defect immediately.]
;B[dh]
;W[jf]LB[mc:A][qg:B]C[I thought this was a good reducing move at the time, although I think with so much open space, I probably should've played deeper in areas such as A or B.]

;W[le]
;B[ke]C[So this was the moment of truth, do I cut him off at A? Or do I ensure my triangled group doesn't get sealed in and force myself into a fight.]
;W[kf]C[I chose the cut. ]
;B[mf]

;B[li]LB[mj:A]TR[ng]SQ[lf][mf][lg][lh][li]C[At this point, I'm just staring at the board trying to figure out how to make a net work properly for the triangled stone. I realized at this point however, that Black may not respond to another extension at A. His squared group had plenty of liberties and space for movement in the upcoming capture race. So I devised a new plan.]

;B[gg]LB[qh:A]C[I don't think Black noticed this, but the cut at A works. See variation.]
(;W[hi]C[But safety first!]

;W[mo]
;B[mn]
;W[gn]C[Strike at the heart of his shape! (I also thought I was going to cut as well, but that a little bit of reading showed me that wouldn't pan out so well. Not to mention I wouldn't gain that much from the kill.]
;B[nn]
;W[ho]C[So I decide to protect my territory and then cut it time allows for it later.]

;B[ri]C[So remember the other variation where I could catch the triangled stones 100%? I decide that there is a chance for me to destroy a lot more territory if I went turned instead...]
;W[pi]
;B[rg]C[Black is relieved to save his stones, but doesn't realize how big the impending problem of my (soon-to-be) ponnuki will be.]

;B[nk]
;W[oj]LB[pj:A]C[This move might have been better at A, but I had intentions of possible destroying the entire black in the center.]
;B[rk]
;W[mk]C[Threaten the disconnect while reinforcing my connection...]
;B[nj]
;W[mh]C[With precise planning and execution, the group has been crippled to one eye and will most likely not make a second one...]
;B[ko]C[Black now struggles for one more eye.]
;W[mp]C[The one piece I can advise weaker players on ensuring a dead group stays dead is to simply reinforce our own positions and not let the opponent exploit any aji.]
