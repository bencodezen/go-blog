;W[fq]
;B[eo]
;W[cq]LB[cp:A][dq:B]C[So the question for me was, which side do I block?]
;B[dq]C[I wanted to be consistent with my play at K4 and utilize the stone properly in the event a fight broke out. As far as I understand, blocking the other side would be too kind to White and reduce the effectiveness of K4.]
;W[cp]
;B[cr]C[Playing on the second line this early might have been a bit premature, but I saw endgame sente potential and it firmly kept the two groups separated.]
;W[fo]
;B[fn]C[So in case anyone plans on trying to imitate this. I took a bit of time read this out to make sure (to the best of my ability) that the cut would end up in my favor regardless.]
;W[do]C[I thought this was a bit odd on White's part. This is terribly obvious and helps to strength Black's stones to further attack the F3 group.]
;B[dn]
;W[co]
;B[fp]
;W[go]
;B[gp]
;W[qn]
;B[qo]
;W[pn]LB[ql:A][nq:B][qq:C]C[So at this point, I know low SDK players and below generally are tempted by playing around A to steal away the base and try to kill the R6 group, but remember that it's important to play solidly and not create opportunities for your opponent to attack you. And let's not forget, the area around B is still SUPER invadable. In fact, C still works.]
;B[np]
;W[ql]
;B[qj]C[It's a simple move that has three benefits:

1) Pressure is put on White's R6 group.
2) The iron pillar works very well with the S14 stone as an extenision. 
3) Strengthens the Q10 stone without introducing aji.

;B[nj]
;W[ml]
;B[lj]
;W[ne]
;B[ob]LB[pb:A]C[This might've been a little small, but I thought that it would protect the corner while expanding the territory a little bit. Maybe A would have been better?]

;B[cd]

;B[ce]
;W[eg]
;B[db]
;W[eb]
;B[cb]
;W[fc]C[At this point, I knew I had given White a wall to help solidify his territoy on the top, so I tried to think of how I would be able to reduce/invade.]
;B[jf]C[This was the best I could come up with for the reduction. I figured an invasion would most likely die or cause other groups to become weakened. I chose this move because it could easily run and had a number of ways to move into White's territory. In addition, I was playing on the lines of the proverb, "If you want to reduce, play along the border of the enemy's territory, but no deeper."]
;W[dm]
;B[en]
;W[bh]
;B[bg]
;W[ng]LB[kh:B][ph:A]C[So this move was rough for me, I saw two potential issues: A or B. ]
;B[oh]C[I decided to try and protect my territory on the right, although maybe it would have been better to connect the K14 stone instead.]
;W[nh]
;B[oi]
;W[jh]C[Now my "reduction" move looks like an invasion. Sigh.]
;B[lh]C[So if you're wondering if I was aware of the double peep, yes. I was ready for it.]
;W[mi]
;B[li]
;W[mj]
;B[mk]
;W[nk]
;B[lk]
;W[ni]
;B[oj]
;W[kg]
;B[mf]C[I thought this was clever on my part. ]
;W[nf]
;B[lg]
;W[kf]
;B[md]C[I planned this out too. ]
;W[me]
;B[nd]
;W[ld]
;B[mc]
;W[mo]
;B[mp]
;W[lo]
;B[ho]C[This was a move to prevent the groups to easily connect and wreck havoc. ]
;W[im]TR[mf][lg][lh][li][lj][lk][mk]C[So it's an obvious ladder breaker, and this is where Josh's advice resonated in my head: "Do you want 4 points in exchange for the triangled group dying? Does that sound like a good trade to you?"]
;B[ij]C[I resisted my DDK habits and chose to strengthen my weak group.]
;W[hh]C[He must have realized it too, and chose not to save his two stones yet either.]
;B[nm]C[So this was something I thought I had read out perfectly, but it was a sequence that ended in me being gote and white being strengthened. Not worth it.]
;W[nl]
;B[no]
;W[mm]LB[om:A]C[I forgot he could block this side. I thought he would block at A.]
;B[nn]C[So this seems SUPER slow, but hear me out:

1) Any other variation I could this of would lead to some kind of empty triangle or aji filled situation.
2) I couldn't just tenuki and let him get a free eye. That would defeat my entire purpose of the peep!]
;W[km]
;B[jl]
;W[jm]
;B[il]
;W[hm]
;B[fl]
;W[hl]
;B[hk]
;W[gl]C[This is my opponent's mistake of the game. He played it pretty quickly and then instantly had a look of regret on his face. For a second, I know he almost reached forward to change his move, but then realized that it was too late and could only stare in disbelief.]
;B[gk]
;W[fk]
;B[fj]
;W[fm]
;B[ek]
;W[em]
;B[gn]
;W[gm]
;B[rm]C[I found this move as well. I thought it was pretty clever since White cannote capture it easily. The thing I failed to consider is that my corner was still prone to invasion.]
;W[qq]C[This move COMPLETELY surprised me.]
;B[pq]
;W[ro]
(;B[qr]LB[rn:A]C[I thought this was smart to reduce the damage to my territory, but after going through the variation at A, I definitely should've played A.]
;W[qp]
;B[po]
;W[rn]
;B[rl]
;W[pc]C[I thought this was a great move, I'm sure it might have been an overplay, but in the tournament conditions, I wanted to continue playing solidly.]
;B[oc]
;W[qd]
;B[qc]
;W[pe]
;B[pb]
;W[qe]C[I knew this was what the variation he wanted, but unfortunately I couldn't come up with a way to stop it.]
;B[pf]
;W[oe]
;B[od]C[I probably didn't need to worry as much as about the cut as other parts of the board, but I didn't want to create a liability for later on.]
;W[rr]
;B[ps]LB[or:A][pr:B]C[This is a mistake in hindsight. It allows for the peep at A which could have substantial effects. A solid connection at B eliminates that aji and still keeps the endgame sente move.]
;W[jr]C[This move was probably super overplay. Probably was not suppposed to work, but you'll see...]
;B[lp]C[Prevent an easy connection.]
;W[kq]C[Moment of truth. He peeped. So the natural move is to connect right? Right?!]
;B[jq]C[SO WHY DID I PLAY THIS?! Sigh...

In actuality though, I thought I had read out the sequence where he would be unable to connect. I was wrong by one liberty...]
;W[kp]
;B[ko]
;W[jo]C[So far so good... I saw this playing out..]
;B[kn]LB[ln:A]C[After I played this, I thought, wait........White at A and this was all POINTLESS. *hangs head in shame*]
;W[ip]C[Mistake #2: I forgot there was a ladder that would work in his favor. Sigh.]
;B[mn]C[Might as well get something in return.]
;W[kl]
(;B[jk]C[Slow move yes. Secures an eye? More important. See variation.

On second thought... This was dumb.]
;W[br]
;B[dr]
;W[jn]
;B[ln]
;W[lf]
;B[hq]C[I liked this move because it threatened to pull out the stones while making sure the F3 stone did not end up being used to kill my entire lower left corner.]
