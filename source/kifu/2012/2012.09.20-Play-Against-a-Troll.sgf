;W[be]WL[1759.928]C[See? Now white's stones are connected. Since I didn't have a good follow up move, I went ahead and tenuki'd.]

While a lot of beginners will be tempted to play A instead since you would "gain another point," you have to remember that the sequence will have black end in gote and also make white live almost permanently (subtracting out even more ko threats).
