;B[pd]BL[1774.257]C[Being as this is my first live game against a person in a long time, I thought I'd keep it simple. And for me, it doesn't get much simpler than star point, which allows me to be very flexible while also being the position that I probably know the most joseki for so I can respond appropriately.]
;W[dc]WL[1796.088]C[3-4 with the strong side facing my hoshi. Noted.]
;B[qp]BL[1768.883]C[It's been awhile since I'ved played, and the last place I left off with fuseki involved using the micro-Chinese quite extensively. So this 3-4 was a way for me to keep it as simple as possible since this was just the begining.]
;W[dp]WL[1768.584]C[Star point. Great! Looks like I'll get to start setting up the micro-Chinese!]
;B[fq]BL[1763.784]C[Since I've been gone for awhile, I'm not abreast of the latest and greatest with fuseki, so I wondered whether White would do something differently or not.]
;W[cn]WL[1745.843]C[Calm response. Okay. I know my next move!]
;B[lq]BL[1754.971]C[Micro-Chinese fuseki setup complete!]
;W[nc]WL[1720.444]LB[pf:A][qf:B]C[Approaching at the top. I considered A (Q14) and B (R14) for some time since I wanted to hopefully get a double-winged enclosure in the lower right.]
;B[pf]BL[1739.65]LB[pj:A]C[I decide to go with the one-space jump since I felt it would have better synergy with A (Q10) if I got the chance to play it later.]
;W[ce]WL[1703.155]LB[oc:A][jd:C][nd:B]C[This tenuki took me completely by surprise. How refreshing! 

Now the only question was whether I needed to take advantage of White's tenuki immediately or not. I debated the kick sequence starting with A (P17) for a while...]
(;B[pj]BL[1674.095]C[But I felt that would be rushed and this was a better framework for me anyhow. ]
;W[qc]WL[1647.755]LB[jd:A][qd:B]C[I was expecting A (K16) at this time since it looks like a possible moyo game, but 3-3 invasion it is!]
;B[pc]BL[1642.049]LB[qd:A]C[For a brief moment, I debated playing A (R16) instead since I wanted to develop the right side, but then I remembered that that rule really applies in the one space low pincer joseki, so I went ahead and extended once.]
;W[pb]WL[1618.31]C[White hanes to connect and gain shape.]
;B[qd]BL[1630.197]C[I now can block the right side.]
;W[rb]WL[1610.002]C[White correctly makes proper shape as per the joseki.]
;B[rc]BL[1617.182]C[I atari as a forcing move to close off any easy entry into the right side.]
;W[qb]WL[1589.93]LB[jd:A][dj:B][fo:C][op:D]C[The joseki ends with White connecting or else foreit the corner and right side for a complete loss in this area.

But now I have sente, and I looked around the board trying to debate what I should do. ]
;B[ic]BL[1556.208]LB[dj:A][fo:B][op:C]C[I decided to split the top area since it would give me a miai for settling with a two-space extension. The rest of the areas seemed like good moves, but I wasn't interested in focusing solely on growing my moyo. After all, the lower right side might look like Blacks, but it would have been a big mistake to think that. Flexibility was the main goal for me here, and this seemed like a good way to prevent White from turning it into a moyo game.]
;W[rd]WL[1516.505]C[I was surprised to get this cut so early.]
;B[re]BL[1542.817]TR[ic]C[But on second thought, it occurred to me that White most likely wanted to settle the group before embarking on an attack on the marked stone (J17).]
;W[iq]WL[1500.71]C[White tenukis again! Man was I impressed to see White's willingness to explore the many possibilities around the board and not simply follow the opponent. ]
;B[lo]BL[1505.236]LB[fo:B][cq:A]TR[fq]C[This move was inspired from Game 1 of the Jubango between Gu-Li and Lee-Sedol in that I wanted to treat the marked stone (F3) lightly and simultaneously develop the lower right. 

After all, the way I saw it was that I had a miai for responses in the event White wanted to attack the stone severely.]
;W[fc]WL[1475.746]LB[kc:A]C[This would probably be the first move I would call a mistake for White. When attacking a stone, the proverb to typically follow is "Push your opponent towards your strong areas." In this case, White already has a corner enclosure here, so it would actually be better to attack with a move like A (L17) since it would for Black into a two space extension toward the corner which would strengthen White while making Black feel a little cramped.]
;B[lc]BL[1492.822]C[Once Black plays here, you can see that White's group it all of a sudden looking a bit weaker.]
;W[gn]WL[1453.472]LB[eq:A]TR[fq]C[White seems to be attacking the marked stone (F3) from a distance. And I strongly debated ignoring this attack, but I felt that White getting A (E3) as well would lead White to have a pretty big piece of territory on the lower left.]
;B[cq]BL[1466.892]C[So I went ahead and dove in the corner.]
;W[dq]WL[1439.468]C[White descends to separate Black's stones.]
;B[dr]BL[1453.066]C[Black threatens to connect.]
;W[er]WL[1426.36]C[White blocks.]
;B[cr]BL[1439.758]LB[bo:A][eq:B]C[Black connects with A (B5) and B (E3) as viable options.]
;W[eq]WL[1385.981]C[White correctly prevent Black from connecting the stones together.]
;B[bo]BL[1428.099]LB[bn:A]C[Black slides to extend the group's base and ensure it doesn't die. 

White next move is technically a mistake as far as the joseki goes, so click on A (B6) to see the typical continuation of this sequence.]
(;W[cp]WL[1368.073]C[White pushes here which seems like the natural move since typically you want to reduce your opponent's eyespace / territory.]
;B[bp]BL[1416.746]LB[bn:A][co:B]C[Black naturally will black, but the difference here is that Black's shape is pretty much settled at this point while White still has some weaknesses around A (B6) and B (C5).]
;W[bq]WL[1358.126]C[I was a little puzzled when White cuts here, but I saw it as an opportunity to test my reading abilities and choose the best variation.]
;B[aq]BL[1398.137]LB[br:A]C[I chose the atari from this direction since an atari at A (B2) seemed to leave more aji than I'd be comfortable with as far as eye-space and shape was concerned.]
;W[ie]WL[1338.689]LB[bn:A]C[I was a little surprised that White would leave A (B6) unsealed, but I was very pleased to see White take the initiative with this attack.]
;B[le]BL[1382.58]LB[sd:A]TR[pb][qb][rb][nc][qc]C[I debated capturing at A (T16) in order to weaken the marked group, but felt that it was important not to let White seal in my stones.]
;W[sc]WL[1319.696]C[It's almost like White read my mind. Haha. Bravo to White for ensuring the group's life did not come into question.

So my next thought was, where should I move next?]
;B[cj]BL[1300.654]LB[kd:A][op:B]C[I debated trying to come up with a way to defend against the peep at A (L16) or maybe further solidify my lower right corner with B (P4), but in the end, I felt that I needed to do something about White's immense potential on the left.]
;W[ck]WL[1300.645]C[I was definitely not expecting White to attach in order to attack me. And I debated for a while in terms of whether I should hane below or above...]
;B[dk]BL[1208.563]LB[bk:A]C[Even though the hane at A (B9) was much simpler for me to read and felt safe, I wanted to embrace the potential complication of hane'ing over the stone and trying to manage as best as I could. ]
;W[cl]WL[1280.311]LB[dj:A]C[White calmly extended. Much respect for that since a cut at A (D10) would have made my life a lot easier as far as making sabaki (i.e. eye shape).]
;B[cg]BL[1173.364]LB[dj:A]C[I did debate trying to defend the cut at A (D10) somehow, but honest I felt it would make my group very heavy and give White something to attack while gaining profit. So I decided to play light and keep my focus on playing a flexible game.]
;W[dj]WL[1261.704]C[White cuts as expected, and now I'm like... So I wanted to be flexbile... but I don't know how to exactly deal with this...]
;B[ci]BL[1043.06]LB[di:A]C[I debated the atari at A (D11) but ended up extended since I felt it was a simple move that did not inadvertently strengthen White while giving me a heavy group to deal with.]
;W[dh]WL[1239.494]LB[ch:B][di:A]C[White's jump here was unexpected, but I liked that it challenged me to try and be creative with my response. After all, a move like A (D11) or B (12) would leave me with a heavy group.]
;B[be]BL[970.848]C[So I decided to keep with the notion of playing light and being flexible. Since White was already strong in the corner, I wasn't hurting myself much by using this attachment as a probe and potential ally for a possible upcoming fight for my life.]
;W[di]WL[1218.491]LB[ch:A]C[Whte's connection here is solid and almost instinctively causes me to want to connect at A (C12) since I don't want to get cut apart.]
;B[cd]BL[941.953]C[But then I reminded myself once again of my goal to play light and to be flexible. And since White ignored me in the corner, I'm happy to start making some shape here!]
