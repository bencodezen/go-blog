(;GM[1]FF[4]CA[UTF-8]AP[CGoban:3]ST[2]RU[Japanese]SZ[9]KM[0.00]PW[White]PB[BenGoZen]C[GoQuest game against 1d opponent];B[fd]C[In 9x9 games where White gets komi, I find that it's important to take the initiative and thus usually choose the 4-4 point since the influence it exerts is quite powerful on such a small board.
cloudbrows\: Rating, not rank! X)

cloudbrows\: The opening moves I've seen the most in GoQuest are tengen, the 4-4, and the  3-4 (bots play that a lot). I am _not_ particularly good at 9x9, and haven't been able to really decide if any of those options works better for me than the others. I usually just open on Tengen.

cloudbrows\: I only ask because rating seems like the most important metric on GoQuest, since rank is based more on experience (though once you get to 1k/1d, it has a rating floor, too).

bengozen\: My opponent was 1d.

cloudbrows\: Do you remember what your opponent's rating was?
];W[df];B[eg];W[fe];B[ee]C[So you want to fight? En garde!

And for those wondering why I didn't choose the hane at G5, it is because it doesn't help to connect my stones up and make it very easy for White to keep Black divided.];W[ef];B[ff]C[cloudbrows\: This is insane. On the other hand, it's kind of the only move.

bengozen\: Tell me about it. I felt so vulnerable when I made this move as I stared at the numerous cutting points.

bengozen\: Thanks!

But after looking at the state of the board, White chooses not to continue and resigns.
cloudbrows\: Demolished!
