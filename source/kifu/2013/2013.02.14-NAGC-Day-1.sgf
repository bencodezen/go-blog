;W[nc]
;B[jd]C[Right from the get go, my plan is to separate White and win by keeping her groups separated.]
;W[qf]
;B[oe]C[Keeping consistent with my plan.]
;W[qc]
;B[pc]
;W[qd]
;B[jp]LB[pg:A]C[This tenuki is questionable. I was only able to discuss with her briefly, but it seems that I owed her a move at A]
;W[cn]
;B[fp]C[Played high to maintain consistency with the sanrensei decision.]
;W[bp]
;B[cq]C[Decided to let White settle so that I could get sente.]
;W[ck]
;B[pj]C[And then I take sente to do something rather lackluster. I think attacking the F17 stone might've been better.]
;W[pe]C[Seems harmless at first.]
;B[pf]
;W[qe]
;B[pg]LB[od:A]C[I thought this was good to build influence and gain power. This is the wrong move. A is the correct move. It might be bad shape, but it keeps White separated, which would be consistent with my original plan.]
;W[od]C[This cut is MUCH bigger. Let's White connect her entire group. Me = Failed.]

;B[hd]
;W[ef]
;B[gf]
;W[ce]LB[de:A]C[This threw me off. I knew the obvious response was A, but I instead choose to try something stupidly weird instead.]
(;B[ee]LB[de:A]C[In case you're wondering, A was the correct move for Black..]
;W[de]C[Now White shows why Black is stupid.]
;B[fe]
;W[cd]
;B[cc]LB[fd:B][cf:A]C[In this regard, I thought I had seprated White. To my naivety, Joanne later clarifies that the A stone is worth much more than the B stones since it helps her connect her groups up.]
;W[bc]
;B[fb]LB[df:A]C[Gote, and White already sacrificed those anyways, should've taken sente to do something else, like cut at A or something.]
;W[df]
;B[dl]
;W[en]LB[cl:B][fl:A]C[This move throws me off, and I consider playing A, but then I realized that White playing B would mean White would get a better result than if she just played normally when being reduced. So I decided to "punish" her overplay.]
;B[cl]
;W[bl]C[So apparently I had the right idea. Then I go and screw it up.]
(;B[bk]LB[bm:A]C[This was too good for white. Letting her settle? Perfect. Should've hane'd at A instead. See variation.]
;W[bj]
;B[dk]
;W[ak]C[Now white is connected and has a ponnuki. Wonderful...]
(;B[gl]LB[cj:A]C[Joanne said that I probably should've just atari'd at A. She would need to respond since the variation would be bad for her.]
;W[gn]
;B[dn]C[I thought I read this out properly...]
;W[do]
;B[dm]
;W[eo]C[And then I forget there's this variation. xD Leave it to a pro to see the one variation that works out in an instant. Haha.]
;B[ho]LB[hp:A]C[Weird move. I need to just play regularly. A would've been perfectly fine. Now I go and give her a reason to exploit my bad shape.]
;W[ep]C[White wastes no time exploiting Black's bad shape.]

;W[gq]
;B[go]
;W[er]
;B[dr]C[I attempt to start a ko when I don't really have a threat.]
;W[dq]
;B[fn]C[this was my best attempt.
]
;W[cp]
;B[fm]C[So yes, I cut off the group and sealed White from the center, but I let her settle a rather large chunk of corner on and gave her sente.... What a bad exchange. Haha.]

;B[oj]C[Such bad shape.....]
;W[qj]
;B[jl]C[Losing move. xD]
;W[mf]C[Once I saw this... panic mode set in. Haha.]
;B[ng]
;W[mg]TR[mf][mg][mh][ni][nj]C[So at this point, I realize my only chance is to capture the triangled group. ]
