;B[oq]BL[2634.708]C[I made a mistake in choosing this opening. We had just gone over this in the workshop, so of course Nate would know how to deal with this.]
;W[qf]WL[2670.564]LB[qj:A]C[The reason why I say it was a mistake is because I have no experience with how to deal with this. I am familiar with the splitting move at A [R10\], but not this approach.]
;B[pj]BL[2560.899]C[Unfortunately I decide to go super aggressive on a large scale.]

;B[og]BL[2382.968]C[I'm thinking I'im doing well since I am profiting on the right side while attacking, but it seems I am already behind in regards to fuseki as a whole.]
;W[kb]WL[2450.509]
;B[kg]BL[2375.376]TR[me][mf][mh]C[This move attempts to be multi purpose: (1) Attack the marked White group. (2). Make shape. (3) Get out in the center.]
;W[li]WL[2392.353]
;B[ji]BL[2324.575]C[Continue the attack while trying to strengthen my own group. However, it is worth nothing that there's not much pressure really being applied on White since he is already out in the center. This is what I would call a textbook example of a "non-threatening attack."]
;W[jh]WL[2356.725]C[White fights back.]
;B[lh]BL[2298.814]C[Threaten to separate White's group.]
;W[ni]WL[2174.953]
;B[oh]BL[2185.229]C[Here I play solid thinking I'm attacking and solidifying the right side at the same time, but this may be a bit lackluster.]
;W[mg]WL[2088.378]
;B[ie]BL[2121.101]C[Make more shape.]
;W[kh]WL[2007.838]
;B[cc]BL[2066.75]TR[mb][mc][kd][md][ie][le][kg]C[I feel like I can get sente to negate Black's wall, but I think this was a poor choice in hindsight. The reason is because my marked group is still weak and giving White influence is only going to help him attack my group.]

;W[cf]WL[1983.994]
;B[fe]BL[1956.308]C[Here I end up switching gears since I want to help my weak group. Sigh. So scatter brained...]
;W[fb]WL[1932.389]
;B[da]BL[1938.356]C[Must defend for life.]
;W[ge]WL[1882.79]C[White takes advantage of Black's weak connection.]
;B[lg]BL[1910.629]C[Black hopes to return to the attack on the center group, but in reality he is the one under attack.]

;W[ff]WL[1763.21]
;B[ih]BL[1829.313]
;W[km]WL[1608.335]
;B[mj]BL[1770.824]C[This is a textbook example of overextending yourself when trying to attack your opponent. Black is still very weak. No time to be poking out eyes.]
;W[nj]WL[1562.914]
;B[mk]BL[1754.953]
;W[mi]WL[1553.914]
;B[jj]BL[1689.74]
;W[nk]WL[1509.415]
;B[pl]BL[1678.81]C[I think I'm being clever here by "solidifying the right side," but in reality White's shape (though a bit heavy) is very strong and ends up being problematic for Black's thin connection along the right hand side.]
;W[ml]WL[1462.304]
;B[jk]BL[1662.961]LB[ii:A]TR[mj][mk]C[This move is to threaten to connect back with the marked stones while protecting the cut at A.]
;W[jq]WL[1431.117]C[White correct analyzes the situation and determines it's time to take the last mutual big point.]
;B[dj]BL[1636.534]LB[ej:1][fj:2][gj:3][hj:4]TR[mb][mc][kd][md][ie][le][ig][kg][lg][ih][lh][ji][jj][jk]C[So Black tries to do the same, but I think that it's actually a bit of an overplay since Black does not have time to be worrying about reducing White when his marked group is still not quite settled. And the reason I think it's an overplay is that there is too much space for White to cause problems / start a splitting attack.]
;W[dl]WL[1395.941]
;B[cq]BL[1633.001]C[Once again I think to take some territory in sente and then negate the area.]

;W[fq]WL[1367.501]C[But this only helps White gain more influence against my weak groups.]
;B[lq]BL[1577.275]C[Here I try to take territory while threatning to invade.]
;W[ko]WL[1322.831]C[White correctly defends.]

;W[eg]WL[1097.992]
;B[gf]BL[1204.281]C[Here is my losing move. I should have just left this area alone.]
;W[ef]WL[1092.181]C[Because now I feel obligated to finish the area.]
;B[hf]BL[1201.434]LB[pn:B][oo:A]C[And think this is sente, cause I have intent to come back and play at A or B. ]
;W[qo]WL[1056.288]C[Then White masterfully maintains his whole board view and initiates a sequences that reverse the game entirely in his favor.]
