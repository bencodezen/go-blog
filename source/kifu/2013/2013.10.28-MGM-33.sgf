Many thanks to Nate for letting me share our games! In addition, a big shoutout to my sensei frozensoul for reviewing this game with me so that I can provide a more thorough review!]
;W[dd]WL[1793.739]
;B[qp]BL[1780.19]
;W[dp]WL[1778.577]
;B[fq]BL[1777.43]C[Probe to find out White's intentions.]
;W[cn]WL[1768.063]
;B[op]BL[1769.456]C[I should really find out if there is a name for this fuseki. If not, I'm going to have to give it one. xD]
;W[qj]WL[1745.425]C[White splits the right side.]
;B[jd]BL[1761.346]LB[fc:A]C[This is a little weird by Black. Better probe would be at A, but I was worried about the pincer and wanted the opportunity to build the top.]
;W[iq]WL[1714.092]LB[qm:C][fo:A][cq:B]C[White pincers here. Unfortunately, Black still has options due to the fact that A and B are still options. Instead, White should consider settling with an extension at C.]
;B[fc]BL[1747.514]C[I get my ideal approach move.]
;W[cf]WL[1693.197]C[White calmly responds.]
;B[qh]BL[1725.835]C[And then I approach strongly from the top.]
;W[qm]WL[1688.042]C[The following sequence is one that I was taught to work in conjuntion with Black's framework on the top, so don't blindly imitate without realizing the purpose behind it.]
;B[pl]BL[1720.02]C[Shoulder hit.]
;W[ql]WL[1681.551]C[Push to remain connected.]
;B[pj]BL[1718.257]C[Attach to gain influence.]
;W[pk]WL[1678.583]C[Push to create cutting points.]
;B[ok]BL[1717.166]C[Block while threatening to capture the stone.]
;W[qk]WL[1676.856]
;B[pi]BL[1716.428]LB[oj:A]C[Extend upwards for nice influence towards the top of the board. In addition, Black is not worried about the cut at A since the ladder is in his favor.]
;W[qc]WL[1657.512]LB[nk:B][ol:A]C[This deviates from the typical sequence. White should cut at A to settle his group. After White A, Black extends at B.]
;B[pc]BL[1698.745]
;W[qd]WL[1653.88]
;B[qf]BL[1691.819]C[This is the first time I've really used this move intentionally. The purpose is to gain sente and play bigger points on the board.]
;W[rf]WL[1651.239]LB[rg:A]C[After White's attachment here, Black should hane here.]
;B[lq]BL[1665.63]LB[kq:A]C[But I'm unsure of the move, so I decide to protect my weak side here. Note that this is too timid on Black's part though, Black should play at A to be more severe.]
;W[io]WL[1637.879]C[At this point, it's getting dangerous for Black in the lower left, but I decide to try to play on a larger scale and not worry about the lower left yet.]
;B[qe]BL[1634.557]LB[rg:A]C[I decide to solidify my thickness here, but the hane at A would still be better.]
;W[re]WL[1634.249]
;B[qb]BL[1633.143]
;W[rb]WL[1631.316]
;B[pb]BL[1608.263]
;W[ra]WL[1593.126]
;B[fe]BL[1576.745]C[Here I try to raise the framework.]
;W[kh]WL[1549.711]LB[pe:A]C[White plays here to reduce Black's center moyo. In addition, for those worried about the cut at A, I had no intention of saving the R15 stones. They had done their work pressing White down, I did not think they would be useful from that point on.]
;B[ol]BL[1525.865]LB[ih:B][rn:A]TR[qj][pk][qk][ql][qm]C[I play here to prepare for an attack on the marked White stones, but this is slow. A faster and more severe attack would be at A. From a whole board perspective though, it would be better to attack with B.]
;W[mh]WL[1529.425]C[White further reduces Black's center moyo.]
;B[ri]BL[1518.458]C[I decide that it was a mistake for White to ignore my attack and press onwards.]
;W[ro]WL[1524.962]C[White slides for eye space.]
;B[rp]BL[1513.103]C[Block the corner while attacking the group.]
;W[rj]WL[1517.516]C[White blocks to try and create living shape.]
;B[rn]BL[1484.133]C[Clamp to prevent White from making easy living shape.]
;W[qn]WL[1464.774]LB[on:A]TR[kh][mh]C[At this point, I debated playing at A to just seal White in, but thought that it would be better if I had a chance to chase White out and possibly gain some ground to attack the marked stones in the center.]
;B[qo]BL[1455.332]C[So I firmly capture the stone.]
;W[rm]WL[1452.991]
;B[so]BL[1446.641]
;W[on]WL[1451.064]
;B[mn]BL[1432.176]LB[kj:A][jn:B]C[This cap is overly aggressive and fails to take into account the whole board. I'm hoping to chase him out, but in reality, it would be better to start an attack or leaning attakc on the other White groups instead.]
;W[nm]WL[1446.992]C[White pokes his head out.]
;B[mk]BL[1417.695]LB[oj:A]C[One-point jump because the cut at A can be dangerous.]
;W[mm]WL[1442.162]
;B[ln]BL[1339.983]
;W[lm]WL[1401.012]
;B[kk]BL[1329.092]
;W[km]WL[1350.045]C[At this point, White is essentially connected to the center; so I decide to try out a tesuji I had read out.]
;B[pn]BL[1324.849]C[Wedge!]
;W[pm]WL[1338.739]LB[oo:A]TR[ln][mn][lq]C[Apparently it was a mistake for White to play here. White should instead descend at A and cause complications for the marked Black group.]
;B[om]BL[1322.837]
;W[po]WL[1336.579]
;B[nn]BL[1320.487]
;W[qi]WL[1329.41]C[When I decided to wedge and cut White off at Q6, I had seen this sente sequence, and based on my reading, I would be okay.]
;B[rh]BL[1304.482]C[Obviously must protect these stones.]
;W[ph]WL[1327.495]C[Moment of truth. Where do you play as Black?]
;B[ni]BL[1252.819]LB[pg:B][oh:A]C[If you would have chosen the atari at A or B, you would have found yourself in a very difficult situation since there are so many cutting points that White can take advantage of. I was very grateful to be able to find this move.]
;W[pp]WL[1283.295]C[So White pushes in the last area that might possibly yield life.]
;B[oq]BL[1220.366]C[Remember, when trying to kill a group, do not willingly create cutting points for your opponent.]
;W[pq]WL[1267.485]
;B[qr]BL[1176.755]C[Must make life for my corner group.]
;W[qq]WL[1236.557]
;B[rq]BL[1127.091]C[Necessary.]
;W[pr]WL[1233.322]
;B[rr]BL[1091.214]C[Once again, necessary/]
;W[kn]WL[1230.811]LB[oo:B][or:A]C[This move surprised me. I thought White would make a move at A or B n order to start calling into question Black's stability.]
;B[oo]BL[1083.728]C[So here I'm fully expecting to start a ko fight.]
;W[pn]WL[1227.577]C[But I'm surprised when White backs down.]
;B[or]BL[1075.234]C[So I take the final remaining shape point while threatening to connect.]
;W[ps]WL[1220.763]
;B[ko]BL[1028.194]C[And then hane for eye hsape.]
;W[jo]WL[1201.945]
;B[kp]BL[1012.048]
;W[mq]WL[1137.772]C[At this point, I believe I should be able to live, but with my group completely surrounded, I didn't dare test my life and death skills at this point in the game.]
;B[mp]BL[962.956]C[So I make the safe inside hane.]
;W[pe]WL[1113.725]TR[ni][pi][pj][kk][mk][ok][ol][pl][om]SQ[qe][qf][qh][rh][ri]C[White cuts, and it very clear to me that Black is split apart into two weak groups. If either dies, my entire efforst to kill the Q1 group will have been for naught.]
;B[pg]BL[934.253]LB[oe:A]C[So I threaten to capture the cutting stone and give myself the opportunity to capture at A if White tries to save the cutting stone at Q12. In addition, I was relatively confident that my P7 group wouldn't die, which is why I chose to atari from this direction.]
;W[oe]WL[1102.841]LB[qh:2][ni:1]TR[pb][qb][pc][pd]C[At this point, many kyu players might be concerned about the marked stones on the upper right, but once again, don't forget that Black has two weak groups in teh center. If either dies, it will be an easy game for White.]
;B[oh]BL[903.938]TR[pb][qb][pc][pd]C[So I decide to follow the professional style and remove any remaining weaknesses from the board. After all, to capture the marked Black stones will not be a simple task, and there is plenty of aji left to exploit there.]
;W[nc]WL[1097.368]C[So White makes good on his threat.]
;B[lc]BL[815.726]LB[nb:A][nf:B]C[And I play this overconcentrated move to threaten to connect at A. In reality though, i would have been better to split the White groups at B.]
;W[md]WL[1084.993]
;B[nb]BL[793.176]C[I decide to attach here because I thought I could connect.]
;W[mb]WL[1075.331]
;B[mc]BL[790.362]
;W[ob]WL[1073.628]
;B[nd]BL[788.927]
;W[na]WL[1069.955]LB[od:A][ne:B]C[I'm about to connect at A, when I look a little closer and realize that White will simply push at B and then I need to catch the N16 stone in a ladder (which does not work out in my favor at this time).]
;B[ne]BL[691.621]C[So I make the solid extension.]
;W[od]WL[1002.8]LB[oc:A]C[At this time, Black has the option of starting a ko, and many kyu players would probably be tempted to do so, but it is very small in regards to the whole board. If you look carefully, even though Black has capture a big group on the right, White's left side is actually very rich in potential and there is still a chance for him to stage a comeback.]
;B[cq]BL[647.783]C[So at this point, I decide that it's time for me to finally call the F3 aji into play and start reducing the left potential.]
;W[dq]WL[998.335]C[What follows is joseki.]
;B[dr]BL[646.009]C[Threaten to connect.]
;W[er]WL[997.125]C[Block.]
;B[cr]BL[644.132]C[Solid connection.]
;W[eq]WL[994.591]C[Prevent connection.]
;B[bo]BL[643.229]C[Knight's move to expand eye space.]
;W[bn]WL[992.816]C[Blockade Black from the left side.]
;B[co]BL[642.297]C[Threaten to escape.]
;W[do]WL[991.278]C[Finish the blockade.]
;B[cp]BL[641.547]C[Connect solid to ensure life.]
;W[em]WL[981.946]LB[dn:A]C[Protects the cutting point at A. And now that black has sente, The question becomes, "How to reduce White's left side without coming under severe attack.]
;B[eh]BL[616.902]LB[dg:A]C[This isn't a bad idea, but when you want to reduce, a shoulder hit like A is much more appropriate.]
;W[nf]WL[972.887]C[Pretty big move for White. This helps White connect his two groups in the center and destroys Black's center potential.]
;B[me]BL[503.652]C[This turn is really not that big. Black can definitely afford to sacrifice the stones if he wants.]
;W[mf]WL[965.587]C[But since Black committed.]
;B[le]BL[496.277]C[This is only natural. See how one small move cannonballs into more small moves?]
;W[of]WL[962.687]C[And now White is connected while Black maybe got 3 points. At least Black gets sente. though.]
;B[lb]BL[481.732]LB[eb:A]C[And I decide to protect my top side, but this is not very effective Since White still has lots of reducing moves for the top like A.]
;W[ff]WL[943.018]C[This is a little aggressive on White's part, but at this point, White must try to turn the game around and therefore plays like these are normal.]
;B[ef]BL[433.988]C[Black is not afraid to fight.]
;W[ee]WL[937.755]
;B[fd]BL[389.613]C[Solid connection!]
;W[gf]WL[931.613]LB[hd:B][ef:A]C[Here I'm surprised that White does not capture my A stone, but I have a feeling White was expecting Black to protect at B first.]
;B[eg]BL[355.254]C[But like Go Seigen, I shall do no such thing! Let us do battle!]
;W[jk]WL[919.769]C[This move was a quick reminder that it was time to check in on my center group. Though it looks like there are lot of stones in the center, Black has to be careful he doesn't die.]
;B[kj]BL[300.569]C[I extend once for shape.]
;W[jj]WL[914.947]
;B[og]BL[291.335]TR[qi][qj][rj][pk][qk][ql][pm][qm][rm][on][pn][qn][po][pp][pq][qq][pr][ps]C[And then out of sheer paranoia, I decide to make absolute life. In reality though, Black should have remembered that he has more liberties than the White group and should be able to win a capturing race pretty easily. So this move was unnecessary.]
;W[if]WL[895.735]LB[hd:A]C[Nice jump by White to ensure safety, and again I have a feeling that White wanted Black to defend at A.]
;B[ch]BL[225.669]LB[ce:B][cj:A]C[But I had no intentions of doing so, the left side is getting HUGE now and I must help my weaker group before it's too late. At this point though, I was expecting White to pincer at A to remove my base. So I was eyeing the aji in the B area.]
;W[df]WL[882.359]C[White seems to have read my mind, so he makes shape.]
;B[ck]BL[216.315]C[But I am happy to make a base. It's a big dangerous still, but I feel that my shape is pretty flexible at this point and should be able to make something work.]
;W[hd]WL[848.92]C[White now tries to punish Black for ignoring his threat to invade the top.]
;B[cc]BL[199.413]LB[hc:A]TR[dd][ee][cf][df]C[Though the normal move would be to simply connect, it is as professionals and dan player say, Defend by counter-attacking! And with the marked group being very weak, I couldn't help but take the 3-3 point now.]
;W[dc]WL[845.854]C[White must block on this side.]
;B[db]BL[193.22]C[Threaten to connect.]
;W[eb]WL[843.412]C[Block.]
;B[cb]BL[191.424]C[Solid connection.]
;W[ec]WL[842.261]TR[fc][fd][fe]C[Prevent connection. It is as this point that I realize I could live in the corner if I wanted, but the marked stones would likely die and then my entire top would be in jepordy.]
;B[fb]BL[186.713]C[So I found this descent to threaten to connect while protecting the top.]
;W[ea]WL[833.038]
;B[hc]BL[177.391]C[And then I connect back under.]
;W[id]WL[803.887]C[White threatens to undemine the entire top.]
;B[ic]BL[173.366]C[Black must extend to connect.]
;W[je]WL[794.049]LB[jc:A]C[White makes shape, but I also believe that White thought Black would connect at A. However, while that might be a normal move that kyu players would think of, I did some analysis and realized that I would not die White cut at A. It would reduce the top side a bit, but in return...]
;B[be]BL[151.76]TR[ef][eg][ch][eh][ck]C[I would gain the corner and stabilize my marked weak group on the left and completely wipe out White's left moyo.]
;W[bf]WL[786.28]C[White must try to resist.]
;B[ce]BL[140.498]LB[de:A]C[Threatens to cut at A.]
;W[de]WL[770.93]
;B[cd]BL[138.575]C[Connect solidly for life.]
;W[jc]WL[760.045]C[So White now asks Black to prove whether or not he was correct in tenuki'ing.]
;B[jb]BL[133.85]
;W[kd]WL[753.77]LB[ib:D][kb:B][kc:C][ld:A]C[At this point I thought about capturing the stone at A, but decided it would start a ko fight. Black A. White B, Black C, White D. And since I was pretty sure I was ahead, I saw no reason to start the ko.]
;B[kc]BL[122.892]C[So I made the solid connection here.]
;W[ld]WL[745.977]LB[ka:A][la:B]C[And then almost by instinct, I thought about making an eye at A, but that would give White the option of a ko. And once again, I was not interested in starting one when I was at an advantage.]
;B[la]BL[98.202]C[So I descend solidly for life.]
;W[lf]WL[725.212]LB[oc:A]TR[nd][le][me][ne]C[White does not want to give Black a chance for a picnic ko with A, so he firmly captures the marked stones.]
;B[ab]BL[40.525]C[Though it may not be necessary, I was starting to run low on time, and since White has me firmly surrounded, I was not interested in testing my life and death skills at this time.]
;W[hb]WL[708.976]LB[gb:B][ib:A]TR[fb][fc][fd][fe]C[This move gave me a lot to think about. A and B were the moves I was debating between. My concern with A was that the marked stones would be cut off and then my E14 group would be in jepordy again. In addition, if White succeeds in connecting to the E19 group, my M19 group does not have enough room to live.]
;B[ib]BL[30]OB[5]C[After almost two minutes, I decide that I have found the way for me to prevent the cut.]
;W[gb]WL[697.395]LB[fa:B][gc:A]C[When I was reading out the sequence before, I saw myself connecting at A and then White connecting at B. This would be disastrous since I was sure that my top group would certainly die. After seeing the variation though, it seems I would win the race by one liberty, but I was in no position to read out that semeai accurately while being in byoyomi.]
(;B[fa]BL[30]OB[5]LB[gc:A][gd:B]C[I was very happy to find this move. If White cuts at A, Black cuts as well at B. However, Black will be ahead of the capturing race since it will be 3 liberties to White's 2. ]
;W[mr]WL[586.599]C[When White descends here, my blood runs cold momentarily since I'm unsure of whether or not the life of my group is in question.]
;B[lr]BL[30]OB[5]C[I decide to descend first to see White's intentions.]
;W[os]WL[576.047]C[When White shows that he can connect here, I almost panic since I'm like, "Crap. He connected." And then I realized, wait... this doesn't make two eyes.]
;B[mo]BL[30]OB[5]C[So I went ahead and made solid life to remove any final shenanigans that White might try.]
;W[kr]WL[564.325]LB[ls:A]C[After double checking my life and death status, I decide that a simple descent at A would be too timid.]
;B[jr]BL[30]OB[5]C[So I chose the clamp which would be the final move for the game as White resigns here. ])
