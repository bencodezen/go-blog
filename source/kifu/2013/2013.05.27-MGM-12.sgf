;W[cd]
;B[pj]LB[ed:A]C[Although I would normally take a proactive role at A, I wanted to see how White wanted to approach the sanrensei.]
;W[nq]
;B[lq]
;W[qn]C[This is very common in handicap games. By switching directions, it creates more complications for White to possibly take advantage of later. ]
;B[oo]LB[np:A]C[I believe joseki has me playing at A, but for some reason I am ingrained with this splitting move.]
;W[qq]C[3-3 is standard response.]
;B[qp]C[I blocked the side where I thought I had more potential.]
;W[pq]
;B[pm]LB[mp:A]C[This was a rather passive move. A would probably have been more proactive since it seals White in.]
;W[nc]
;B[pf]C[I responded more calmly in this situation since I didn't want White to switch directions once again.]
;W[jd]C[In hindsight, the right side seems rather overconcentrated at the moment.]
;B[rq]C[I played here since I felt that this was sente and helps me further solidify my right side.]
;W[rr]
;B[rp]
;W[mr]
;B[lr]LB[or:A]C[This is a bad move in hindsight. My goal was to play at A, but there are much bigger moves on the board right now.]
;W[cn]
;B[fp]
;W[dj]
;B[cp]LB[lo:A][or:B]C[This move is rather and would probably have been better spent playing A instead (which would make the invasion at B rather dangerous.]
;W[ec]LB[eb:E][lc:C][bd:D][gg:B][cl:A]C[So clearly we have two frameworks competing with one another. Some players might feel compelled to invade White, but there are plenty of spots for reduction or invasion while my territory seems a lot more solid.]
;B[jj]LB[ii:A]C[Since this is where both frameworks meet, I decided to play here. Although playing at A might have been a bit better.]
;W[mp]
;B[or]C[I decided to strike while I have the chance since I have a lot of strength in the area.]
;W[oq]
;B[nr]
;W[mq]
;B[ms]
;W[pr]
;B[ns]
;W[sr]LB[qs:A]C[Here I am faced with a decision: try to kill? Or play calmly?]
;B[lp]C[I decide to play calmly and take profit while letting White decide if he wants to live.]
;W[ps]C[White chooses to live.]
;B[mo]LB[lo:A][ip:B]C[I thought about a normal extension at A or B, but thought it'd be best to seal White in since it also helps my framework on the right.]
;W[lo]C[This cut is too agressive.]
;B[mn]C[Remember, atari gives you a lot of cutting points which the opponent can exploit, so don't underestimate the value of a solid move like N6.]
;W[ko]
;B[ip]TR[ko][lo]C[This jump seemed a little loose, but the idea was to surround the triangle stones into oblivion.]
;W[jq]C[This was unexpected for me, but I decided to accept White's challenge.]
;B[kp]C[After much reading, I thought this would yield the best result.]
;W[jp]
;B[jo]
;W[jn]
;B[io]
;W[km]
;B[iq]
;W[jr]
;B[ks]
;W[ir]LB[js:A]C[Tilwen pointed out that the descent at A would lead to a ko, which is definitely much better than the game result.]
;B[hr]
;W[gr]
;B[hs]
;W[hq]
;B[gq]
;W[is]
;B[hp]
;W[kr]
;B[ls]
;W[os]C[Seki in sente, and now my lower left has become very solid territory and I have a weak group to attack and further solidify the right side!]
;B[lm]
;W[kn]
;B[hm]
;W[il]
;B[kl]
;W[jl]
;B[hl]LB[kk:A]C[I think this attack is questionable. A might have been better.]
;W[kk]
;B[ll]
;W[jk]
;B[lk]C[Maintain pressure while building the right side.]
;W[hk]
;B[ij]LB[me:A][li:B]C[This peep was aji keshi and pointless. A better response might have been at A or B.]
;W[ik]
;B[kj]TR[ij][jj][kj]C[Although the stones are facing the wrong side, my purpose in connnecting backwards to my stones is to give me a base when I try to reduce White's framework.]
;W[fk]C[At this point, some players might feel like, "Oh my gosh! White's framework is so big!" Don't forget that Black's territory is nothing to scoff at and that overzealous and jealous invasions are usually what allow White to make a comeback.]
;B[me]LB[lc:A]C[This is an example of growing your own framework while reducing your opponent since is aims at the invasion at A.]
;W[lc]
;B[kf]C[This is a rather slow play, but it aimed at flattening out White's framework while further solidifying points. In addition, I was pretty sure I was ahead at this point, so I didn't want to give White any easy opportunities to reverse the game.]
;W[qh]C[White's invasion is understandable, but I was fairly confident I could subdue the invasion.]
;B[rf]C[I played here to deny White the chance to slide or use the 3-3 point as a weapon later.]
;W[oi]
;B[qj]LB[oj:A]TR[pj][qj][pm]C[Some players might feel a need to play the contact move at A, but this usually only serves to strengthen the invader and give him/her sabaki (eye shape). As a reslt, I chose the iron pillar in order to permanently split the White groups and stabilize my own connection.]
;W[mh]
;B[kh]LB[nd:A]C[This move is obviously to seal White in, but a move in the A region would probably have been better since White can't easily escape anyhow.]
;W[qe]LB[pe:A][qf:B]C[Although the decision seems simple, this requires a bit of reading to make sure you pick the right direction and don't let White accidentally make life.]
;B[qf]
;W[oe]
;B[pe]
;W[ne]LB[nf:A]C[Here, a number of players will feel compelled to play A.]
;B[mf]C[But once again, the power of a solid move like N14 is not to be taken lightly.]
;W[oc]
;B[nf]C[Black is very happy now since his right side is now solid territory. All that's left is to reduce what White has left.]
;W[bo]LB[bp:A]C[White expects Black to respond at A.]
;B[hf]C[I decide that this is bigger.]
;W[gd]C[See how White is now flat on top? Any center territory is almost completely gone.]
;B[em]C[This move not only threatens the invasion at A, but it grows Black's territory a little bit more as well.]
;W[dl]C[While White gets to secure the C8 area, I was aiming for keeping sente and continuing a reduction strategy.]
;B[eg]C[This might seem a little deep, but my goal was to use the stone lightly to possibly penetrate other areas.]
;W[gg]C[As expected.]

;B[hg]
;W[gh]
;B[gj]
;W[hj]
;B[gk]C[I expected to be able to cut properly, but I didn't realize early enough that this doesn't work.]
;W[gl]TR[gj][gk]C[These stones are definitely captured now.]
;B[ih]
;W[fj]
;B[hd]LB[fe:A]C[This move is two fold. It pushes into White's top territory, but it protects against the cut at A as well. See variation to see what I mean.]
(;W[hc]C[So at this point, the key to this game is maintaining solid endgame since endgame can make a big difference. So, what's my goal? SENTE SENTE SENTE.]
;B[de]
;W[ce]
;B[pb]C[And I forgot, but simultaneously growing my territory while reducing White's is a big goal too.]
(;W[bq]C[I'm not sure if White was correect in ignoring Q18. See variation at 126 for what I was expecting.]

;B[qc]
;W[he]LB[id:A]C[This seems small and the wrong direction. A is better.]
;B[fd]
;W[id]LB[fc:A]C[I was surprised to see White capture. I expected him to block at A since Black's H16 could not run anyways.]
;B[fc]C[So in return for one stone, I was happy to walk into White's territory up top.]
