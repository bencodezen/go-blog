;W[qn]WL[1789.111]LB[dd:A]C[In a 3-stone handicap game, White will normally take a corner in the upper left (A) area before approaching. ]
;B[cd]BL[1788.124]C[By this point, I had learned of the principle of "corner, sides, then center" when it came ot evaluating the first moves of the game; so I went ahead and took the fourth corner instead of responding.]
;W[no]WL[1777.244]C[My opponent tries to punish me here for ignoring him. This move seems to try to be a double approach, pincer, and pressing move all at the same time; but it really doesn't accomplish much at all since it's on the 5th line.]
;B[nq]BL[1784.032]C[Here I was probably thinking of just trying to stabilize my group. Not a bad idea for 15k.]
;W[oq]WL[1774.641]C[Super aggressive attachment.]
;B[pq]BL[1774.595]LB[op:A]C[And then I played super passively. Better to just cut at A now.]
;W[op]WL[1771.522]C[Now White easily connects.]
;B[or]BL[1772.327]LB[nr:A][pr:B]C[And I hane here thinking I've connected. However, for your practice, you should verify that the double cut at A and B would be problematic for Black.]
;W[mq]WL[1766.832]
;B[np]BL[1765.768]C[Being the 15 kyu I was, I jumped at the opportunity to atari. ]
;W[oo]WL[1764.21]C[But this only helps give White nice shape.]
;B[mp]BL[1763.895]C[I have enough sense not to let White atari me here, but this is also good since I am not letting White seal me in.]
;W[lq]WL[1762.233]
;B[rp]BL[1743.728]C[I decide to protect the corner.]
;W[qp]WL[1758.676]
;B[qo]BL[1736.215]C[Very simple ladder question: Can Black capture White?]
;W[qq]WL[1757.367]C[White doesn't think so.]
;B[qr]BL[1734.411]
;W[rq]WL[1750.113]
;B[sq]BL[1732.648]
;W[ro]WL[1748.599]C[Tries to double atari.]
;B[rr]BL[1730.328]C[And then I capture for a nice solid corner.]
;W[po]WL[1747.615]TR[qo]C[When White atari's here, my question to you is: Should Black save the stone?]
;B[qp]BL[1728.697]C[The answer is absolutely not, but being the 15k I was, the idea of letting my opponent capture a stone was mortifying.]
;W[rn]WL[1746.689]
;B[mo]BL[1721.11]C[Here is a a great example of kyu tunnel vision. There is no reason for Black to continue play in this area, but since this is where all the action is happening, Black just plods along here when there are much bigger areas to play in.]
;W[pl]WL[1743.786]LB[pn:A]C[White is trying to protect the cut at A.]
;B[ml]BL[1705.676]C[And then I decide to two space jump.... because.... um... I guess I thought I was moving my group out into the center.... xD]
;W[pi]WL[1742.201]
;B[mi]BL[1700.246]C[And apparently if White jumps two space again, clearly I thought it was a good idea to do the same.]
;W[pf]WL[1740.573]
;B[me]BL[1691.883]C[I guess this was my idea of sealing White in...]
;W[nm]WL[1739.815]
;B[mm]BL[1680.354]C[Even at 15k, I could tell White was trying to cut me, so naturally I tried to strengthen my connection.]
;W[nl]WL[1735.557]
;B[mk]BL[1671.372]LB[nk:A]C[All I'm thinking about here is keeping my stones connected, but the hane at A is better.]
;W[cq]WL[1730.795]C[Oh no! A 3-3 invasion!]
;B[dq]BL[1661.966]C[At this point I have no idea about direction of play, so I really think this was just a sheer guess.]
;W[cp]WL[1729.139]
;B[co]BL[1660.611]C[Apparently I have enough sense to hane. xD]
;W[dr]WL[1726.685]
;B[er]BL[1657.275]
;W[ds]WL[1724.029]C[This is a classic DDK (double digit kyu move that aims to seal out endgame early on, but it's a bad move this early in the game.]
;B[es]BL[1655.229]
;W[bo]WL[1722.092]
;B[cr]BL[1650.981]C[White doesn't protect his cutting point, so I jump at the opportunity to capture more stones!]
;W[br]WL[1720.595]C[Question: Which move should Black play next?]
;B[cs]BL[1649.375]LB[bs:A]C[If you were looking at A (B1), you would be correct! At this point, I clearly did not see the snapback potential.]
;W[cn]WL[1717.348]
;B[do]BL[1646.062]C[Naturally I save my stone.]
;W[bp]WL[1714.005]
;B[dn]BL[1638.067]C[And then I had the sense to push! Not bad! =D]
;W[cm]WL[1712.294]
;B[bs]BL[1632.415]C[And then I play this dumb move thinking I can remove an eye... Oy vey...]
;W[cj]WL[1704.77]C[White correctly moves on.]
;B[ch]BL[1625.706]C[And I apparently instantly want to prevent White from coming any further.]
;W[df]WL[1701.391]
;B[cf]BL[1621.215]C[Must connect stones!]
;W[de]WL[1698.686]

;W[dg]WL[1697.775]
;B[hd]BL[1599.366]LB[cg:A]C[Wow. I could have sworn I was going to connect at A, but apparently I decided to tenuki and start building a framework at the top!]
;W[dd]WL[1694.68]
;B[dc]BL[1598.086]C[Hane to expand my corner.]
;W[fc]WL[1693.552]
;B[eb]BL[1588.518]C[And kosumi (diagonal move) to further protect my corner.]
;W[fb]WL[1692.043]
;B[hb]BL[1575.514]C[Here I'm apparently trying to wall off the top.]
;W[jd]WL[1690.172]
;B[lc]BL[1559.722]C[White invades, so I continue to try and surround territory on the top.]
;W[jb]WL[1688.558]
;B[jc]BL[1550.312]C[And then I wedge because I think I can cut White apart.]

;B[gd]BL[1532.519]
;W[gc]WL[1677.724]
;B[dl]BL[1500.756]LB[je:A]C[I'm surprised I didn't go straight for the stone with the atari at A. This move seems like I am thinking of further growing the center area, which is not a bad idea.]
;W[cl]WL[1676.028]
;B[dk]BL[1496.814]C[With the contact play, I naturally extended.]
;W[iq]WL[1670.887]
;B[ck]BL[1487.436]C[I'm not sure what I was reading out here...]
;W[fq]WL[1669.884]LB[bk:A]C[White should really have blocked at A.]
;B[fo]BL[1482.11]C[I'm clearly worried for the safety of my group.]
;W[fr]WL[1668.72]
;B[eq]BL[1475.29]C[And apparently I am worried that White will falsify my eye... except he wouldn't cause I can connect at D2 if I really wanted an eye there....]
;W[fs]WL[1667.512]
;B[bl]BL[1464.035]LB[bk:A]C[Yay! Apparently I had enough tactical sense to know that White couldn't cut me at A.]

;W[go]WL[1642.093]
