;B[pd]BL[1176.814]
;W[dp]WL[1195.821]
;B[qp]BL[1173.63]C[Though I have been experimenting with this opening, I am starting to think that I am not the fondest of purposely exposing my weak side to my opponent when I already know my opponent has a star point facing it. Perhaps it's time to change this.]
;W[dd]WL[1189.74]
;B[fq]BL[1171.092]C[Probe to determine White's intentions.]
;W[hq]WL[1161.814]
;B[nq]BL[1146.007]LB[fo:A][cq:B]C[Why tenuki? I still have two options for the F3 stone. And I chose the large knight's enclosure to aid in any potential fighting that might occur at the bottom later on.]
;W[kq]WL[1128]LB[cq:A]C[At this point, the invasion at A seems good for Black, but I didn't want the game to revert to a more or less traditional position and thought it would give White a little too good of a position on the bottom. ]
;B[fc]BL[1132.824]LB[cq:A]C[So I decided to tenuki and leave the option of A open. ]
;W[fe]WL[1030.774]LB[cc:2][hd:3][cf:1][dj:A]C[This is a mistake by White since normally there should be a stone at A. Any of the three number moves are options to take advantage of this mistake.
]
;B[pj]BL[1104.343]C[I chose to tenuki again and see what White's intentions were on top.]
;W[cj]WL[1003.213]TR[fe]C[Unfortunately, I let White get the move she needed which made the F15 move a good move. It's important to note though that the C10 stone would be better placed on the 4th line since Black can easily reduce with a capping move at E10.]
;B[jd]BL[1063.733]LB[hc:B][hd:A]TR[fe]C[Though this may seem to work well with my overall framework, I think that it is rather awkward since the invasion at A/B is already staring me in the face due to the marked White stone at F15. So I would consider this a bad move in hindsight.]
;W[fp]WL[798.036]C[This is a pretty big move since it not only threatens to solidify the bottom as territory, but it also grow White's moyo as well. In the meantime, Black's position is very thin and White will have no trouble invading and living.]
;B[ip]BL[988.307]C[The idea behind this move was to gain some more influence in the center and hopefully build a bigger moyo than White. See variation at J3 to see what I was expecting.]
(;W[eq]WL[778.47]C[White decides that the corner is bigger and wants to take away the 3-3 invasion.]
;B[iq]BL[965.812]C[So I decide to cut since White ignored me.]
;W[ko]WL[753.203]
;B[in]BL[859.999]C[One point jump to the center to chase White.]
;W[km]WL[704.087]
;B[fn]BL[732.479]C[I switch directions in order to try and expand my shape for life later on and to hopefully damage the left side.]
;W[dn]WL[569.7]C[A very prudent defense by White.]
;B[eo]BL[679.37]TR[fq]C[This is just flat out vulgar, but for sake of understanding why I played here, I was intently focused on trying to bring out the marked stone and hopefullly make my group live in sente so I could attack the L3 group to my heart's content.]
;W[do]WL[549.128]C[And if you're wondering why it's vulgar, it's because I give White 4th line territory for essentially nothing.]
;B[gp]BL[674.64]C[And here I try to execute my "tesuji." See G3 for correct refutation.]
(;W[fr]WL[504.023]LB[gq:A]C[I'm lucky that White atari'd from this side, but in reality these were bad moves on my part; so nothing I'm proud of.]
;B[gq]BL[667.744]
;W[gr]WL[498.44]
;B[hr]BL[646.603]C[And now I'm lucky enough to make life and a strong shape. It was at the cost of the entire left corner though, so it's vital that Black make up for it with his attack on the L3 group.]
;W[nn]WL[352.916]C[White makes shape.]
;B[pn]BL[580.562]C[I choose to defend before and attack from a distance before attempting to kill it. Although in reality, I should have never even thought aout killing the group. It's just flat out unreasonable.]
(;W[go]WL[280.938]
;B[hp]BL[571.979]
;W[fm]WL[231.384]
;B[cq]BL[513.395]C[Here I try to make something work.]
;W[dr]WL[198.038]C[But White beautifully refutes my invasion.]
;B[gn]BL[478.342]
;W[gm]WL[184.842]
;B[ep]BL[466.785]C[And here I cut and make life in sente.]
;W[en]WL[179.51]
;B[fo]BL[463.181]
;W[dq]WL[177.073]C[While this is a victory in one regard, I have REALLY solidifed the left corner now.]
;B[lp]BL[436.7]LB[il:A]C[So this move was intended to make White heavy, but the correct move for Black is to split White by playing at A.]
;W[kp]WL[168.873]LB[im:A]C[And though White connected, White would have been better just giving black the bottom and playing at A to make his moyo even bigger.]
;B[jl]BL[391.306]C[Though this is similar to the one point jump, it has some connection issues that will be problematic for Black.]
;W[oq]WL[103.817]LB[np:A]C[According to the dan playe who reviewed our game, A would have been better for White to make shape.]
;B[np]BL[367.29]C[I stand my group up to make the connection strong and keep White separated.]
;W[or]WL[31.344]
;B[op]BL[341.077]C[I decide to indefinitely sever any connection potential White has and connect my own group up.]
;W[mr]WL[30]OW[5]C[White tries to connect back to the L3 group.]
;B[nr]BL[299.621]C[I push down in sente.]
;W[ns]WL[30]OW[5]
;B[lq]BL[281.627]C[Strengthen my connection while threatening to cut.]
;W[lr]WL[30]OW[5]
;B[jr]BL[276.419]C[Then I secure my group while cutting off any possible connection back to the G2 group and threaten the cut at L2 in sente.]
;W[kr]WL[30]OW[5]
;B[pq]BL[248.946]C[I decide to play here to remove any possibilities of White living in the corner and strengthening my own connections. I'm really hoping to attack the weak group while making profit]
;W[pm]WL[30]OW[5]C[Though the common move is to attach when the player attaches...]
;B[on]BL[235.227]C[I decide it's better to cut and fight since I'm strong and White's weak.]
;W[om]WL[30]OW[5]
;B[nm]BL[232.048]C[And I deliver on my promise to cut.]
;W[kl]WL[30]OW[5]LB[jk:A]C[At this point, the natural move is to push at A.]
;B[ln]BL[217.257]C[I thought this move would make White heavy While poking out any eye potential.]
;W[kn]WL[30]OW[5]
;B[jk]BL[171.693]
;W[nl]WL[30]OW[5]
;B[mm]BL[141.817]C[Must save the cutting stone.]
;W[ml]WL[30]OW[5]
;B[lo]BL[117.531]C[I connect here to remove any aji and solidify my position before resuming my attack. It was a move that was made more out of fear however, in case anyone is wondering.]
;W[ql]WL[30]OW[5]C[rouyakun [2k\]: p9 haha
]
;B[ok]BL[108.102]LB[pk:A]C[So thought my goal was to threaten to cut, this is awkward shape and would be better placed at A.]
;W[ol]WL[30]OW[5]C[bengozen [4k\]: yes
]
;B[lm]BL[86.797]C[This is probably my worst move in the game. It is the epitome of a thank you move and gives me an empty triangle. If you're wondering what I was thinking, it was "Threaten to cut and make White heavier.." The only problem with this is that it will only help White in the upcoming fight.]
;W[ll]WL[30]OW[5]
;B[qn]BL[81.614]LB[rj:A]C[This move was played with the intention to take away White's eyes, but a move like A would make far more sense since it's time I tried to get some profit from White's weak group.]
;W[rj]WL[30]OW[5]TR[pj][ok]C[White getting this sliding move is big and makes my marked stones look kind of silly.]
;B[qk]BL[61.002]C[As you can see, I've lost all concept of profiting and am solely focused on trying to kill the group. 
]
;W[rk]WL[30]OW[5]
;B[rm]BL[59.245]C[And then I play this impulsive move thinking White needs to connect...]
;W[pi]WL[30]OW[5]C[Except not really.]
;B[pk]BL[51.509]C[Isn't that shape just the most beautiful thing you've seen? Two empty triangles in one move. *end sarcasm*]
;W[rl]WL[30]OW[5]C[cloudbrows [3k\]: Oof.
Roosta [2d?\]: could have done something else I think

;B[qi]BL[20.129]C[Still trying to kill White...]

;B[qh]BL[0.635]

;B[qg]BL[30]OB[3]C[Trying...]
;W[ni]WL[30]OW[5]
;B[nj]BL[30]OB[3]C[Played here was wishful thinking since I wanted White to hane at N10 so I could crosscut and try for shenanigans.]
;W[mi]WL[30]OW[5]C[White responds correctly.]
;B[ej]BL[30]OB[2]C[And then I try for one last full out reduction.]
;W[gj]WL[30]OW[5]C[Except White is strong and now it's more of an invasion.]
;B[ck]BL[30]OB[2]C[Attach to try and make sabaki...]
;W[dk]WL[30]OW[5]
;B[dj]BL[30]OB[2]C[Crosscut to complicate things...]
