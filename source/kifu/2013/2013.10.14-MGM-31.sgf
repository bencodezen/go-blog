;B[pd]
;W[dp]
;B[qp]C[The one thing to remember when exposing the weak side of your 3-4 to your opponent is that it offers a possibility of a fighting-centric game.]
;W[oq]C[As ililustrated here.]
;B[cd]C[I decided to take the third corner instead and see what White's intentions were with the lower right corner.]
;W[po]C[White wants to press Black down.]
;B[qo]C[So I decide to go ahead and give him some influence while gaining some profit.]
;W[pn]
;B[qm]LB[qn:A]C[Here the proper haengma (i.e., stone movement) is the one point jump. The extension at A is slow and violates the principle of "pushing from behind."]
;W[pm]C[White pushes once more for solid shape.]
;B[ql]C[Black extends once more to prevent White from sealing him in while securing more profit..]
;W[cj]C[Since White took the big mutual point on the left side, I felt that White's framework was starting to get a little to big for my liking.]
;B[cq]C[I decided to 3-3 with the intention of making either the thickness at Q5 or C4 less efficient. However, this is early and a mistake strategically since it gives White the choice of direction and a lot of influence and power for later on in the game.]
;W[dq]C[White correctly blocks on the correct side.]
;B[cp]C[Extend.]
;W[do]C[Here is a clear illustration of White's intentions of giving Black a bigger corner with the purpose of building the bottom.]
;B[co]C[I decide to go ahead and take my profit and hopefully take sente and deal with the bottom. ]
;W[cn]C[White's hane is to be expected.]
;B[dr]LB[bn:A]C[I decide to go ahead and establish my base instead of following White at A.]
;W[er]
;B[cr]
;W[bn]C[White's extension here seems a little too aggressive.]
;B[dn]C[I'm pretty sure that White cannot kill the corner, so I decide to cut in order to leave aji for later.]
;W[fq]LB[eq:A]C[White protects his weakness at A.]
;B[bo]C[Time to protect my corner.]
;W[cl]C[White decides to securely connect.]
;B[jp]C[Then I decide to try and negate White's influence / framework on the bottom. However, this is actually too deep. I can't provide a better alternative, but just know that this is too deep.]
;W[lq]LB[jn:A]C[White should actually cap at A and attack Black. This extension is too passive.]
;B[lp]C[Since White is strong now, I decide to attach and make sabaki.]
;W[kq]LB[kn:B][kp:A]C[For anyone tempted to connect at A, you are making your group heavy and asking your group to come under certain attack with a move like B.]
;B[jn]C[Jump to make shape while playing light.]
;W[jq]
;B[go]TR[dn]SQ[dj][ej][fk][gk][hk][ik][jk][kl][ll][ml][nl][om]C[My aim here was to keep light shape while aiming to utilize the marked stone for aji; but this is the wrong direction. Black is behind enemy lines and should run out into the center.]
;W[jl]C[White correctly caps, and now Black has to scramble for life.]
;B[en]C[I decide to pull out the stone, but this seems rather slow now.]
;W[ip]
;B[io]C[Hane for eye shape.]
;W[hp]
;B[fp]LB[eq:A]C[This hane here was to prepare for a possible throw-in tesuji at A.]
;W[gp]
;B[fo]C[This connection seems rather dubious now. My group just looks heavy and rather dead.]
;W[im]C[White hits a vital point.]
;B[ho]C[I decide to connect, but I'm still in trouble...]
;W[gl]C[White starts to really surround me now.]
;B[el]C[I try to jump while I still have the chance.]
;W[ek]
;B[fk]C[I could only hane to create some complications and hopfully gain an eye or two.]
;W[fl]
;B[dk]C[Hoping to either break out or kill the left side.]
;W[dl]
;B[ej]
;W[em]
;B[dm]C[And now we have a ko if White chooses to play it out.]
;W[ek]
;B[eq]C[Threaten to connect with the corner and be completely alive.]
;W[ep]
;B[el]
;W[qn]LB[rn:A]C[The normal move is to respond at A, but I decide to make a Go Seigen-esque trade.]
;B[fm]C[I decided that the power and stability gained from winning this ko would outweight losing the corner.]
;W[rn]C[And not to mention I get sente. xD]
;B[ch]C[So now the left group is at my mercy!]
;W[di]
;B[fh]C[Time to chase it!]
;W[dh]
;B[cg]C[Solid extension to make profit while still attacking White.]
;W[dg]
;B[df]LB[cf:A]C[I hane here because I've already read out the cut at A and know that it doesn't work.]
;W[fg]
;B[ef]C[Take away White's vital point while starting to possibly build a top framework.]
;W[eg]C[White connects in bad shape.]
;B[gd]C[Kind of a weird move in hindsight, but I was trying to build the top.]
;W[ck]
;B[bi]C[I thought this move would be sente while defending my territory.]
;W[gh]C[But White is in the center already, so the B11 move was very small.]
;B[fi]C[Since White is not quite alive, I decide to pull this stone out and still harass the group.]
;W[gf]
;B[fe]C[I connect to try and solidify the upper left while still putting pressure on the group.]
;W[hj]C[White is now saying, "You're not quite alive yourself Black!"]
;B[gm]C[So I decide to secure one eye first.]
;W[hl]
;B[kp]LB[ln:A]C[This move seems dubious again. It doesn't  gain me any eyes at all. I should have considered a jump at A instead.]
;W[pl]
;B[lm]C[Though I might lose a lot of points on the right side, I decide that I am not quite alive and need to make shape now.]
;W[lk]
;B[op]TR[qo][qp]C[And now I utilize the aji from the marked stones.]
;W[pp]
;B[mq]C[Hane to make some eye shape.]
;W[mr]
;B[nr]LB[eo:1][gq:2][iq:3][pq:5][lr:4]C[Double hane here with the intention of possibly exploiting the various weaknesses that are marked on the board.]
;W[nq]C[White chooses the simple atari.]
;B[mp]C[Connect.]
;W[lr]C[White removes the aji from the bottom/]
;B[np]LB[pq:A]C[Connect for solid shape while threatening to possibly make life in the lower right corner by utilizing the cut at A.]
;W[qq]C[White protects.]
;B[in]C[This seems incredibly stupid now... I guess I was trying to make sure I had two eyes....]
;W[qf]LB[qi:A][rn:B]C[When White approaches here, I considered the pincer at A to possibly settle my right group, but it seemed like it would be difficult to do so since I was already undercut by the B stone and would end up giving White a lot of center potential.]
;B[pf]C[So I decide to attach to continue the idea of building the top.]
;W[pg]
;B[of]C[Hane? extend.]
;W[qe]C[Takes away vital point for tiger's mouth.]
;B[qd]C[Block and defend the corner.]
;W[og]C[The extension here is no joseki, but White is clearly trying to maximize his profit on the right.]
;B[nf]C[I extend once more to prevent White from hane at the head of both my stones.]
;W[lf]LB[qg:A]C[Then White aggressively plays here, but there is still a weakness at A.]
;B[ld]C[I decide to go ahead and try and take profit on the 4th line while protecting the top.]
;W[kd]
;B[ke]C[This hane here was rather agressive of me, but I was aiming to use a ladder breaker later to possibly weaken the center white groups and possibly kill one (though this is rather wishful thinking).]
;W[le]
;B[md]C[Extend to the right to protect my shape while taking profit.]
;W[je]C[White atari's as expected.]
;B[hg]C[I play the ladder breaker here.]
;W[kc]C[White ignores and chooses to destroy the top, which is actually a pretty good idea.]
;B[gg]C[However, I decide that I want to go ahead and try to punish White for tenuki'ing.]
;W[hf]
;B[ig]
;W[if]
;B[ff]TR[gg][hg][ig]C[I decide to cut now since I don't see my marked stones getting captured.]
;W[hi]C[White removes the net possibility.]
;B[jg]C[So I must extend to save this group.]
;W[kg]
;B[ji]TR[gh][hi][hj][lk][fl][gl][hl][jl][im]C[Jump to escape while trying to weaken the marked White group.]
;W[kh]C[White takes the vital shape point.]
;B[ii]C[Bamboo joint to ensure connection, though my group seems rather heavy.]
;W[ki]C[Black's looking in pretty bad shape...]
;B[ik]C[But then I find a possible tesuji that aims at the weakness of the White group. Can you see what I'm aiming for?]
;W[ij]C[White pushes.]
;B[jj]C[I attempt to connect.]
;W[jk]C[White cuts as expected.]
;B[kj]C[I extend once more to threaten to escape.]
;W[lj]
;B[hh]LB[gi:A][hk:B]TR[gh][hi][hj][ij]C[And then tesuji! If White connects at A, Black will atari at B and capture all of the marked White stones.]
;W[gj]
;B[gi]TR[dg][eg][fg][dh][di][cj][ck][cl][dl][bn][cn]C[And now the marked stones are dead. Huge gain for Black.]
;W[ll]
;B[jf]LB[ie:A]C[I decide to push here because I'm thinking about cutting at A.]
;W[kf]
;B[rd]LB[ie:A]C[But then I realize that the cut at A is very small and gote, so I decide to further expeand my corner while threatening to reduce the right.]
;W[gb]C[White's tenuki here was very nice. There's no way for me to capture this stone.]
;B[ic]
;W[hc]
;B[fb]C[I attach here to try and seal off the top left.]
;W[hd]LB[fc:A]C[The hane at A would have been tough to handle, so I was glad to see this simple connection.]
;B[gc]LB[hb:A]C[Threaten the atari at A while protecting the top left.]
;W[hb]
;B[ec]LB[eb:A]C[Protect from clamp at A and possible sente endgame sequence later.]
;W[mb]
;B[lb]C[When I attach here, I attach with the intention of sacrificing it so I can get sente.]
;W[lc]
;B[nb]
;W[mc]
;B[nc]
;W[na]
;B[oa]
;W[ma]
;B[pb]C[But I fail pretty miserably. xD]
;W[ng]C[With White's extension here, White's right side if looking pretty nice.]
;B[qg]C[But there is a weakness here and I decide that I must take advantage of it now.]
;W[rg]LB[qh:A]C[White decides that my cut is an overplay and tries to punish me. The atari at A instead would have been simpler and may have changed the result of the game.]
;B[qh]C[So now it becomes a matter of who is right and who is wrong.]
;W[rh]
;B[qi]C[Extend to gain more liberties in preparation for the capturing race that will inevitably happen.]
;W[ri]
;B[qj]C[Extend for more liberties...]
;W[rj]
;B[rk]C[Now I can safely hane, and it has become a full on capturing race.]
;W[pk]
;B[qk]C[I connect in order to maximize my number of liberterties, and now comes the decisive match. I have 7 liberties, and White's liberty is approximately 6 depending on his next move.]
;W[pj]C[White decides that he can win the race by simply reducing mine.]
;B[rf]C[But I have this tesuji!]
;W[re]
;B[se]
;W[sf]
;B[sd]
;W[rm]
;B[sj]
;W[pi]
;B[si]
;W[ph]
;B[pe]C[And Black wins the race!]
;W[mm]C[White tries to seal off whatever he can salvage in the center.]
;B[ln]
;W[fj]
;B[ei]
;W[mn]
;B[mo]C[Maximize my territory size.]
;W[nn]
;B[mf]
;W[mg]
;B[oo]C[This was not sente, but I thought it would be.]
;W[me]C[This is sente and worth more than my push at P5.]
;B[nd]
;W[es]C[White takes a critical endgame point. If Black had gotten it, it would have allowed for possible endgame shenanigans.]
;B[ds]C[I block to prevent the corner shape from being reduced to a possible ko situation.]
;W[km]
;B[kn]C[Protect.]
;W[hm]
;B[gk]C[Atari here to reduce a point.]
;W[hk]
;B[ek]
;W[kk]C[When White plays here, I fail to see the problem at hand. Can you what White is aiming for?]
;B[jm]
;W[jh]LB[gh:A]C[And then it becomes very clear... Whoops... (Black cannot connect at A due to shortage of liberties.]
;B[gh]
;W[ih]C[I just gave my opponent 8 points.... smooth....]
;B[he]
;W[ie]
;B[ge]
;W[fa]
;B[ea]
;W[ga]
;B[hn]
;W[sl]
;B[sk]
;W[ne]
;B[oe]
;W[rl]
;B[rf]
;W[on]
;B[eo]
;W[eq]C[And with that, White resigns here. If you're wondering what the score is, Black is up by approximately fifteen points. Definitely a big milestone for me. =D])
