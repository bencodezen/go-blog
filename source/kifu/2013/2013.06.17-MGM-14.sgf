;W[pp]MN[1]
;B[de]C[A little unorthodox from what I've seen, but nothing wrong with it.]
;W[qf]C[Still following the principle of trying to create some synergy as best as possible in the opening.]
;B[nc]LB[rd:A]C[For those who are tempted to play the A to settle down, I personally feel this is too slow for White since White is already behind. This is a handicap game, so White should emphasize fast development.]
;W[pj]C[Hence why this move is better.]
;B[nq]
;W[jq]LB[pn:A]C[Normal response is might be at A, but once again, it is important to quickly establish position around different parts of the board to complicate the situation and try to bring the balance of power and territory back in your favor.]
;B[qn]C[I think the double approach was a show of good initiative on Black's part to prevent White from easily forming a moyo on the right.]
;W[oo]C[White does not hesitate to split the groups apart.]
;B[qq]C[At this point, White must decide which side is more valuable.]
;W[qp]TR[pj]C[With the marked extension, I thought the right side would give me the most opportunity.]
;B[pq]
;W[fq]C[This tenuki is a little premature, but I knew that trying to settle my shape in the lower right would give Black the initiative to attack the K3 stone.]
;B[dn]
;W[fo]C[Since Black responds calmly, I decide to follow up with a honte (i.e., proper) move to prevent any unbalanced fighting from occurring later.]
;B[rd]LB[dq:A]C[Black chooses to ignore here, although I think that a solid move like A would be good in this case as well since it protects the corner and provides some thickness in the event Black wants to attack the White group later on.]
;W[of]C[Since Black protected his corner up top, once again, I choose to play a proper move since it gives me better shape and grows the right side at the same time.]
;B[ec]C[This is an interesting choice for a shimari since it emphasizes the top. The only problem I have with it is that the corner still seems to have invasion potential and the O17 stone is low which will make it hard to build the top properly.]
;W[cl]C[Since White did not defend the corner earlier, I decided to come harass this group.]
;B[ci]
;W[el]
;B[dr]C[Due to the fact that Black chose the one point jump at D6 earlier, the jump to D2 is too thin to properly defend the corner.]
;W[cq]C[Now White has this peep to see what Black wants to do.]
;B[dq]
;W[co]TR[cq]C[No need to try and save the marked stone, White must treat it lightly.]
;B[cp]C[If you want to cut...]
;W[do]C[Then I shall cut as well!]
;B[cn]
;W[bo]
;B[eo]
;W[en]
;B[ep]TR[bo][co][do]C[So here's the moment of truth: To save or not to save the marked stones?]
(;W[fn]C[Correct. Let Black swallow those stones. In return you have power and thickness that you will use to your advantage later on.]
;B[bn]LB[fp:A]C[For those worried about the push and cut at A, I was ready to throw away the F3 stone in hopes of building something in the center.]
;W[lq]LB[or:A]C[This move might seem weird, but it aims at an invasion at A.]
;B[rp]
;W[ro]
;B[rq]
;W[qo]
;B[no]
;W[nn]
;B[mo]
;W[pn]C[Here I decide to make proper shape since the R6 stone posed too much aji threat for me to feel comfortable tenuki'ing.]
;B[kd]C[Black is now trying to grow his top side.]
;W[jj]LB[cc:C][id:D][gf:B][mo:A]C[In hindsight, this looks rather lukewarm. Black has a stone sticking out at A that negates a lot of center moyo potential. So instead, a reduction in the B area or maybe even invasion in C or D would be more proactive on White's part.]
;B[ei]
;W[or]C[I decide to launch an attack now in hopes of obliterating the group.]

;W[nr]
;B[mq]
;W[mr]
;B[pr]
;W[lp]
;B[mn]
;W[nm]
;B[rs]LB[fp:A]C[Black chooses to make life here. Now that the battle has settled, you can see that my right side is starting to turn into solid territory. At the time, I thought the bottom was looking pretty good, but it is rather overconcentrated since Black still has the push and cut at A.]
;W[id]

;W[ce]
;B[cf]TR[fc][hc][fd][id]C[White has successfully invaded and lived in the corner now. If you go back and study the sequence, you will see how the marked stones were necessary for the invasion to be successful. If White had simply tried to invade in the corner and live, Black would probably have had a good chance in killing White.]
;W[re]LB[mf:B][mm:A]C[This was rather slow of me since I'm trying to turn the right side into cash. Instead, I should've looked to expand the moyo but playing something like A or B.]

;B[qb]
;W[lh]C[White is trying to turn his moyo into cash, but I can't say that this is the best move.]
;B[lj]LB[ll:A]C[Black invades too deeply here. A simply jump at A might've been enough to reduce the moyo and make a dent in the bottom as well.]
;W[ll]C[White quickly takes this point away from Black.]
;B[kk]TR[jj][kk][ll]C[Elephant's Eye! Remember the shape move?]
;W[il]C[Knight move!]
;B[jk]
;W[ki]C[Empty triangle, but a critical point to keep Black disconnected and keep White connected.]
;B[ik]
;W[ij]
;B[hi]
;W[hk]
;B[jl]
;W[kn]C[Keep Black disconnected while trying to settle my bottom territory.]

;W[ko]
;B[kj]
;W[hn]
;B[ng]C[This was a great move by Black. It exploits the thinness of the two spaced extension and threatens to capture the White group which will save Black's group.]

;B[if]

;B[ie]
;W[fi]LB[jd:A][lg:C][kh:B]C[For those wondering why I did not connect at A, I foresaw a potential shortage of liberty issue in the B/C area in the future that I did not want Black to easily exploit.]
