;B[pd]
;W[dd]
;B[qp]C[Keeping to my word, I avoided playing the Chinese Opening.]
;W[dq]
;B[oq]C[Since White chose to have his 3-4 face my weak side, I thought the enclosure would make the most sense. In addiiton, this also helps to limit his growth potential in the event he chooses to play the Chinese Opening as white.]
;W[qj]C[I was ecstatic to see the splitting move here since I had just recently had a discussion with frozensoul on how to take advantage of it.]
;B[fc]C[Probe.]
;W[cf]
(;B[qh]LB[qg:A]C[So this is where I made a slight overplay, I'm actually supposed to only extend to A I believe. I'll explain why shortly.]
;W[qm]C[White extends as expected.]
;B[oh]LB[qf:A]C[I thought this would be sente, but this ends up slowing me down since I fix Black's weakness at A.]
;W[qc]C[But White promptly invades. See Variation at Move 8 for what I was shooting for.]
;B[pc]LB[jd:A]C[Though I don't have a stone at A, this is the only direction to block since I need to try and make use of my stones properly.]
;W[qd]
;B[qe]
;W[re]
;B[qf]
;W[pb]
;B[ob]
;W[qb]
;B[jd]C[Here I deviate from joseki because I can' afford to let White take this point since it would throw much of my strategy into disarray.]
;W[nb]LB[oc:A]C[Yuan Zhou says that this is a little early since White should keep the option of cutting at A open to him for later on.]
;B[nc]
;W[oa]
;B[om]C[I decide to tenuki since a ponnuki on the side will not really impact the board as a whole and not to mention I wanted to take harrass White's weak group.]
;W[oj]
;B[pk]
;W[qk]
;B[pl]LB[pj:A]C[I decide to play her to maintain connectivity, but this may be actually be too passive. Pushing through to cut at A would have most likely been the better move.]
;W[ql]C[Fortunately White connects, so I am allows to return to the original move.]
;B[pj]
;W[qo]C[White attaches here. And though it says that you should hane when someone attaches, I wanted to think more on a global scale.]
;B[oo]C[So I played this move for influence!]
;W[rp]
;B[gp]LB[jp:A]C[I borrowed this move from the Chinese Opening. The idea was that if White decides to pincer in the A area, I would have a thick wall that would be ready to attack him.]
;W[qq]LB[jp:A]C[When recreating this game, I thouight I played A first.]
;B[jj]C[But after thinking about the game more and more, I remembered that I decided to play here first since it started to give shape to the moyo in the center. Not to mention it would difficult for White to invade in the bottom now.]
;W[do]C[Since White enclosed his corner...]
;B[jp]C[I took the second to last strategic point for my framework.]
;W[gn]C[This was a great move by White to start reducing my framework while possibly enlargening his.]
;B[fn]C[I debated this move for a while, but thought the fight might be in my favor.]
;W[fo]
;B[go]
;W[gm]
;B[eo]C[But I have a slight misread in this sequence...]
;W[fp]
;B[ep]
;W[fq]LB[eq:A]C[At this point, I'm thinking I can descend at A and capture the three White stones, but if you see the variation, that would be super wishful thinking.]
(;B[en]C[So I'm forced to connect.]
;W[eq]
;B[el]LB[dp:A]C[Trying to build some strength while aiming to exploit the cut at A.]
;W[gk]
;B[fl]C[I decide to peep here due to a misread with the cut which I'll show shortly.]
;W[gl]
;B[dp]
;W[cp]
;B[co]
;W[bp]TR[do]C[So the peep was in preparation to net the marked stone. As you'll see shortly though, I misread the liberties and the net doesn't actually work.]
;B[jm]
;W[dn]C[I realize that I was wrong in my reading here, so I try to figure out the best way to use my C5 stone.]
;B[cn]C[Increase the sacrifice.]
;W[dm]
;B[cl]
;W[cm]
;B[dl]
;W[bm]C[I did not anticipate this descent, and now I'm thinking that my group might actually die. Crap.]
;B[ch]C[I spend a lot of time before making this risky extension.]
;W[gi]C[To my dismay, White plays solidly.]
;B[eh]C[Here's me threatening to break out into the center but hoping to get some shape.]
;W[fg]
;B[bf]C[I decide that it's too early to try to push and cut, so I take the high road and try to gain some eye shape.]
;W[fh]C[White is worried about the put and cut, but I was happy to see him ignore my attachment because it meant I would almost certainly live.]
;B[df]
;W[ef]
;B[ce]
;W[de]
;B[dg]LB[cg:A]C[This was universally agreed upon to be a bad move. I was supposed to just capture at A. Why you ask?]
;W[cd]C[Because White gets a free forcing move (which actually plays an important role later on.]
;B[be]
;W[bk]C[At this point, I'm not quite sure if I can make life. After all, if I die here, the game is pretty much over.]
;B[bl]C[So I obligingly descend..]
;W[al]
;B[fe]LB[hc:B][ee:A]C[Though the cut at A worked, I was hoping to fix my weakness at B while weakening the White group as a whole for me to attack for profit later on.]
;W[ee]
;B[di]C[I then decide to make my group fully alive since it is such a critical group.]
;W[hq]LB[io:A]C[The permissive move is here, but I was trying to find forcing moves to utilize before responding to White's move.]
;B[hj]C[So I play here expecting him to connect.]
;W[fj]C[And then he plays here, which is a great response since all of a sudden a ko appears... if you can't see it yet, don't worry you will.]
;B[io]C[I have to come back to this move, but the ko is going to hurt...]
;W[dj]
;B[cj]
;W[ck]
;B[ej]
;W[dk]
;B[ek]
;W[ei]C[Boom. Ko.]
;B[fi]
;W[em]C[To be honest, I almost connect here out of instinct, then I actually take 5 seconds to look carefuly and realize... "I will not win this ko if I do." See variation if you don't believe me.]
(;B[ei]C[So I connect. At least I have sente...]
;W[fm]
;B[gj]C[And I have this cut.]
;W[db]C[Remember when I said that the C16 stone would be helpful? This is that time.]
;B[bc]
;W[bd]C[Now White can descent and make shape.]
;B[ad]
;W[cc]
;B[bb]
;W[ec]C[That's one eye....]
;B[fb]C[Must descend to have any chance of killing him.]
;W[fd]
;B[gd]C[No avoiding this ko either...]
;W[ge]
;B[ed]
;W[ac]C[There's debate as to whether this is a true threat, but I believe it is since it can throw my group into turmoil and make him unconditionally alive. Not to mention I was pretty sure I found a ko threat in another part of the board.]
;B[ab]C[So I answered it.]
;W[fd]
;B[rn]C[I thought he'd answer this for sure.]
;W[ff]C[But he resolved the ko.]
;B[qn]C[So I happily sweep up the right side.]
;W[pp]C[Ponnuki in the corner?]
;B[pn]C[No problem!]
;W[gc]C[This is pretty big since White now gets to eat up some of the top, but now is not the time for Black to respond.]
;B[mc]LB[jg:A]C[This was kind of small for me. I notice that the top right corner is still weak, but in reality the whole board move should have been at A.]
;W[op]
;B[rf]
;W[oc]
;B[od]
;W[mq]
;B[mo]LB[jg:A]C[This is small. Once again, should have just taken the big point at A.]
;W[jg]C[At this point though, I'm pretty sure that I'm in sudden death time. So I was unfortunately unable to read any complicated variations out.]
;B[lg]C[So passive it was...]
;W[jl]
;B[kl]C[Passive...]
;W[il]
;B[km]C[Solid connection to prevent complications...]
;W[jr]C[White now is start to enclose off his corner and bottom, but I'm glad to get the initiative back.]
;B[bj]C[Yuan Zhou said that this is actually slow in regards to the whole board. Much bigger things than 8 points on the left. The only reason I played it was that I thought he would respond and that I could seal off the lfet side in sente while solidifying about 12 points. ]
;W[ak]C[Fortunately for me, White thought it was big too, so he responded.]
;B[aj]
;W[am]
;B[hd]C[Now I thought it be best to reduce White's top a bit and salvage something for myself.]
;W[hc]LB[gb:A]C[I was surprised by White's extension here, since I was expecting the descent at A to capture the two stones firmly. Again I was looking for chances to just keep taking sente while reducing White's area down.]
;B[ic]C[But I don't hesitate to now convert some of the top into my own territory.]
;W[ka]C[The monkey jump is pretty big since it destroys a lot of Black potential on top. White is still ahead at this point.]
;B[mb]C[Play a forcing move to strengthen my own position first.]
;W[ma]
;B[kr]C[Then come back to the bottom where I had a feeling I could reduce it a bit.]
;W[kq]LB[ir:A]C[The hane was overplay in hindsight to me. Better to just extend at A for White.]
;B[ir]C[But I was ready for the aggressive response with my own clamp.]
;W[jq]LB[iq:A][lr:B]C[Though this threatens the cut at A, it is better for White to firmly capture the stone at B.]
;B[iq]
;W[gq]C[I'm pretty sure White thought this was sente.]
;B[fs]C[But I knew better than to respond to that.]
;W[fr]C[In the 30 seconds sudden death I have, I'm pretty sure I don't get sente out of this jump. So I tenuki for better sente plays.]
;B[np]
;W[nq]C[Once White commits here, I leave it to return my attention back to the upper right corner (that I have been eying for most  of this game now).]
;B[se]LB[rd:A]C[I had an option to play at A and capture the stone in sente, but for some reason I thought this atari might give me a chance to kill the entire white corner.]
;W[ob]C[Though not the response I expected, this definitely gave me a chance to jump in.]
;B[sc]
;W[sb]
;B[rb]
;W[ra]
;B[sa]C[White's only option is the ko.]
;W[ia]C[This move threatens to pull out the two stones at H17 and kill off F18. Since that means he would live, I had to respond.]
;B[hb]
;W[sb]
;B[gs]LB[ig:A]C[This is by far not the best ko threat I could have found. I considered A, but once again, but complications seemed numerous and let's not forget I was going to lose on time if I was not careful.]
;W[rc]C[White does not hesitate to resolve the ko.]
;B[ds]C[So I hop into White's bottom corner.]
;W[lh]C[This attachment hurt me on the inside.]
;B[mh]C[I had to play passively again since the aggressive variation seemed to lead to White just waltzing into Black's framework.]
;W[li]
;B[mi]
;W[lj]
;B[mj]
;W[kk]C[So now White is about ot convert the center into his territory, which was worrisome for me. But after my training with the Level Up books, I saw an option to fight back.]
;B[jk]LB[kh:A]C[Cut! And the reason I can do this is because there is still a weakness in the connection at A.]
;W[kg]
;B[lf]C[I extend here to protect my tertritory.]
;W[fk]C[White seems to have successfully cut off my stones and converted the center into territory; but I have a trick up my sleeve!]
;B[hi]C[Forcing move to strengthen my connection.]
;W[gh]
;B[lk]LB[kh:B][kj:A]C[Shortage of liberties! If White connects at A, Black will atari at B and capture the whole group.]
;W[ji]LB[ij:A]C[This was a tricky move to threaten the cut at A while preventing the shortage of liberty situation.]
;B[ii]C[But thankfully I managed to read this out quickly.]
;W[ik]
;B[ij]
;W[ki]
;B[kj]C[Success! White has no center territory!]
;W[cs]LB[cr:A]C[Though I could have theoretically atari'd here, I didn't want to start another ko since I'm low on time and just wanted sente.]
;B[es]
;W[cr]
;B[lr]C[Since White did not firmly capture this stone, I was ready to launch more endgame shenanigans!]
;W[js]C[White is running low on time now too, so he decided to try and cut me off.]
;B[lq]C[Luckily I was ready for that.]
;W[mp]
;B[lp]C[Happy to give up one stone to save my M2 group and also capture the K1 group at the same time.]
;W[no]
;B[mn]C[Extend solidly to minimize cutting points.]
;W[nn]
;B[nm]
;W[he]
;B[id]
;W[ke]C[This looks to be a stone that cannot be captured.]
;B[kf]LB[je:A]TR[jg][kg][lh][ji][ki][li][lj]C[But if White tries to escape with A, there will be dire consequences to the marked White group. See variation if you don't believe me.]
(;W[jf]
;B[je]
;W[ih]
;B[if]LB[ie:A]C[If you think White can cut at A, try it!]
(;W[ig]C[White does not fall for my trap.]
;B[ie]
;W[ho]
;B[ip]
;W[hp]
;B[os]C[Final big endgame for me]
;W[or]
;B[ns]
;W[ms]
;B[mr]
;W[ps]
;B[nr]
;W[pr]TR[mp][mq][nq]C[The funny thing here is that because we're so low on time, I was just happy to get sente. In reality though. The marked stones are in atari (which we both completely missed).]
;B[lb]C[So I take more sente plays.]
;W[la]
;B[hf]
;W[gf]
;B[hg]
;W[hh]
;B[ro]C[Then try to seal off my territory in reverse sente.]
;W[sp]
;B[po]
;W[kb]
;B[kc]
;W[in]
;B[jn]
;W[ba]LB[cb:A]C[This is a nice endgame move by White. I should have just played solidly at A.]
;B[ca]
;W[cb]
;B[aa]
;W[ae]
;B[af]
;W[da]C[Now Black can't connect!]
;B[ae]
;W[ba]
;B[ac]C[And he does it all in sente. Very nice!]
;W[sd]
;B[sf]
;W[im]
;B[hk]
;W[hl]
;B[kk]
;W[ha]C[White continues to try and reduce Black in sente.]
;B[ga]
;W[ib]C[For a moment, it seems to be a clever move to force reduce Black's territory while maintaing connection.]
;B[jb]C[But thank you Level Up series, snapbck and chokchoksu (i.e., shortage of liberties) for the win!]
;W[gr]
;B[hs]C[There might have been one or two more moves after this, but White resigns shortly after.])
