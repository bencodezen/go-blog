PW[BenGoZen]PB[Black (Tygem)]
;B[dp]
;W[pq]C[Strong side of 3-4 komoku facing the star point.]
;B[dc]
;W[qd]C[This 3-4 komoku was chosen as a special counter fuseki to a possible Chinese opening.]
;B[di]C[Black chooses the high Chinese opening.]
;W[nc]LB[oc:A]TR[dc]C[Large knight enclosure to negate strong side of Black's marked 3-4. (Note: Small knight enclosure is also an option as well.)]
;B[po]
;W[pl]C[I decided to use the two space pincer to try and work in conjunction with the enclosure on top.]
;B[np]LB[mp:A]C[This was new to me. I'm used to the large knight's response at A.]
;W[nq]C[I decided to attach here to secure my group.]
;B[op]
;W[mq]LB[oq:A]C[White must push ahead instead of connecting at A. This helps to not only prevent the push and cut at A, but also prevents Black from easily sealing White in.]
;B[mp]
;W[lq]LB[oq:A]C[Push again to keep my shape and protect from the push and cut at A.]
;B[lp]
;W[kq]C[Though it pained me to give Black so much influence, I decided to push once more since I thought the hane would be very painful.]
;B[pj]C[Black pincers as expected to use his thickness.]
;W[qh]LB[qj:A]C[I decided to try and play more innovatively and treat that stone lightly. After all, it was far from dead. So I extended while threatening to connect at A.]
;B[qi]C[Black kicks to prevent the connection.]
;W[ph]C[I decide to solidly ascend  and more or less secure some territory.]
;B[nj]
;W[ml]TR[pl]C[I chose the two space jump here because it is faster and keeps with the idea that the marked stone is light. The one spaced jump would be too slow.]
;B[nl]C[Black immediately tries to cut me off.]
;W[ok]C[Here I notice that Black has quite a few weaknesses, so I try to poke at them.]
;B[nk]
;W[oj]C[Threaten to push though.]
;B[oi]
;W[pi]C[Cut.]
;B[pk]
;W[ol]C[These stones are now improtant since they are cutting stones. Though I ended up trying to save the stone I was treating lightly, I changed my plans since I saw an opportunity to fight back.]
;B[ql]
;W[qm]LB[qk:A]C[Hane here to gain more liberties and threaten the double atari at A.]
;B[qk]
;W[nm]C[Hane once more to gain more liberties for the fight.]
;B[om]
;W[pm]C[Connect.]
;B[on]
;W[ni]LB[oh:A][mj:B]C[Cut and my group is saved! A and B miai!]
;B[mi]
;W[nh]C[I extend once to prevent giving Black a forcing move later on.]
;B[lj]
;W[rm]TR[qi][pj][pk][qk][ql]C[And now I extend once more to capture the marked Black stones.]
;B[kp]LB[jc:A][fq:B]C[When Black pushes here, I should hav probably just taken a big point at A or B instead.]
;W[jp]C[But I followed my opponent around like a donkey and thought I would hane instead.]
;B[jo]
;W[io]TR[ml][nm]C[And then because I was feeling like I would be able to fight back with the aji of the marked stones, I decided to double hane.]
;B[ip]
;W[jq]
;B[ho]
;W[in]
;B[hp]
;W[jn]C[I atari once to force Black into inefficient shape.]
;B[ko]
;W[ik]C[Then I jump out into the center.]
;B[km]
;W[kj]C[When I played this attachment, I thought I had read out a sequence that worked in my favor.]
;B[kk]
;W[lk]C[Crosscut as I wanted to do.]
;B[ll]
;W[mk]
;B[mj]TR[lk][mk][ml]C[Except I then forgot that this put my marked stones in atari.]
;W[mm]C[So I go ahead and connect because even though I can't save the stones, they still have quite a bit of aji left in them.]
;B[ki]
;W[jj]C[Must save the cutting stone.]
;B[mh]
;W[lm]TR[lk][mk][ml][lm][mm][nm]C[The atari here and the sequence following is just to further exploit the aji of the marked stones.]
;B[kl]
;W[kn]
;B[ln]LB[il:A]TR[kk][kl][ll][km]C[So while I may be behind on the race now, Black cannot cut at A without risk of of losing the marked stones.]
;W[hn]
;B[fo]
;W[ih]C[I jump here for shape and to make sabaki.]
;B[gc]
;W[ej]C[This was a weird shoulder hit in retrospect. I guess I wanted to expand my eye shape?]
;B[dj]
;W[ek]C[Probably the game losing move now that I think about it. Haha.]
;B[dk]
;W[el]C[I can't believe I'm still pushing my opponent along the line of victory....]
;B[dl]
;W[cq]C[So now I was feeling pretty secure about my center group, and so I decided to take away the corner from Black.]
;B[cp]
;W[dq]
;B[ep]
;W[bp]
;B[bo]
;W[bq]
;B[eq]
;W[er]
;B[fr]
;W[ds]
;B[em]
;W[jc]C[I decide to take the last big point.]
;B[fh]C[Black is starting to surround a sizeable top left.]
;W[if]C[I decide to jump once to secure the group since getting sealed in meant possible death.]
;B[ic]
;W[jd]C[Stood up to further solidify my connection to my center group while hopefully protecting my top territory.]
;B[gl]TR[ej][ek][el]C[Black is threatening to capture the marked stones. ]
;W[gj]C[Since I've already given him 4th line territory, I felt that giving those stones up would be too much.]
;B[hj]C[But then Black plays this marvelous tesuji.]
;W[hk]C[I thought I was fine.]
;B[hi]TR[ej][ek][el]C[Until I realized that my entire center would die if I kept trying to save the marked stones.]
;W[ji]C[So I secure the connection.]
;B[gk]C[And Black secures 7th line territory with this move. Oy vey.]
;W[cc]C[So now it's do or die. Either I reduce this area, or it's over.]
;B[cd]
;W[bd]C[Counter hane.]
;B[bc]
;W[ce]C[Hane around the atari.]
;B[cb]
;W[dd]C[Threaten to start a ko.]
;B[cc]
;W[ff]C[Light jump to connect back to the center while trying to make sabaki.]
;B[gf]
;W[gg]
;B[fg]
;W[ge]
;B[hf]
;W[he]
;B[hg]
;W[ig]
;B[hh]
;W[ef]LB[fe:A]C[Extend here since the cut at A does not work.]
;B[ng]
;W[oh]
;B[me]
;W[ld]
;B[md]
;W[mc]
;B[le]
;W[kd]
;B[pe]C[Getting my territory reduced like this was very painful and another reason why I probably lost.]
;W[qe]
;B[pd]
;W[pc]
;B[rh]C[This hane sucked. You know why? Because there was a ton of aji and now I was on the verge of a captured group coming back to life.]
;W[ri]C[I decide to kill off the group.]
;B[rj]C[But this starts a ko that I really should not be fighting since no matter White will not gain anything by winning this ko.]
;W[qj]
;B[oq]
;W[or]C[Must protect my bottom.]
;B[qi]
;W[mn]C[Threaten to save my group.]
;B[lo]
;W[qj]
;B[fd]
;W[fe]C[Protect the cut.]
;B[qi]
;W[mg]TR[mh][mi][lj][mj][nj][nk][nl]C[Threaten to capture the marked stones.]
;B[lg]
;W[qj]
;B[id]
;W[ie]C[Connect.]
;B[qi]
;W[lh]C[Atari.]
;B[mf]
;W[qj]
;B[qc]C[I thought if I answered this, I would never win the ko.]
;W[qi]C[So I ended it.]
;B[oc]C[But this ended up being rather damaging.]
;W[pb]
;B[ob]
;W[qb]
;B[nd]
;W[cg]C[So now I try to reduce Black territory in sente.]
;B[bh]
;W[ch]
;B[ci]
;W[ed]
;B[ec]
;W[hc]C[I was happy to read out this little wedge tesuji.]
;B[hb]
;W[ib]
;B[hd]
;W[gd]C[Double atari!]
;B[hc]
;W[fc]
;B[fb]
;W[ha]C[I felt behind, so I thought the ko wouldn't hurt me at this point.]
;B[fd]
;W[jk]TR[lk][mk][ml][lm][mm][nm][mn]C[Threaten to save the marked group.]
;B[nn]
;W[fc]
;B[rc]TR[pb][qb][pc][qd][qe]C[As much as I would have loved to ignore this threat, I was pretty sure losing the marked stones and the corner was bigger than 12 points.]

;B[iq]
;W[bi]
;B[bj]
;W[ah]
;B[js]
;W[ks]
;B[is]
;W[qr]C[Saw bad aji here, so I connected.]
;B[sg]
;W[si]
;B[fs]
;W[bs]LB[es:A]C[This is the vital point for life. If you connect at A, bad things will happen.]
;B[es]
;W[dr]
;B[ke]
;W[je]
;B[kg]LB[li:A]C[For those wondering why I'm not capturing at A since it's sente, I thought it was because it is White's privilege to do so whenever. Black can never connect at A without putting himself in self atari. But I would be proven wrong later on.]
;W[be]C[So the focus is on bigger endgame points.]

;W[fd]LB[li:A]C[This was a mistake. This ko is not worth much. Should have captured at A instead since there are not many endgame points left.]
;B[mo]TR[fn][gn][hn][in][jn][kn][go][io]C[With the aji gone, I thought about capturing at A, but then I realized that with my group finally captured, my marked group would get captured. See variation.]
