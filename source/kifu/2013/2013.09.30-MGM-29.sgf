;W[nc]WL[1791.941]C[Very standard approach move.]
;B[jc]BL[1789.048]C[A loose three-space low pincer that works well with the D16 stone in the upper left. So good from a whole board perspective.]
;W[qg]WL[1757.959]C[I chose the two space double approach to start adding some complexity to the game. After all, keeping to standard plays and letting your opponent be comfortable in their responses will make it difficult for White to catch up.]
;B[oe]BL[1778.014]
;W[qn]WL[1748.3]LB[kc:B][qc:A][ld:C][me:D][og:E][qj:F]C[I tenuki here because there is no need to commit to the upper right yet. There are still a number of options.]
;B[pn]BL[1773.744]
;W[qq]WL[1737.882]C[This invasion was a little premature on my part.]
;B[pq]BL[1757.858]C[This direction was a good choice by Black since it gathers power for later on.]
;W[qp]WL[1734.158]
;B[qo]BL[1756.629]TR[pn]C[And because of the marked stone, White's shape is in shambles.]
;W[ro]WL[1731.483]
;B[po]BL[1754.775]LB[rn:1][rp:2]C[Black's shape is very nice while White has multiple cutting points.]
;W[qr]WL[1724.599]C[I decide to try and salvage the corner.]
;B[rn]BL[1749.339]LB[jp:A][pr:B]C[Jumping at this one stone is big in a sense, but an extension at A or blocking at B might be better for global strategy.]
;W[sp]WL[1709.692]
;B[qm]BL[1743.053]LB[jp:A][pr:B]C[This capture is a nice idea since it removes aji and radiates a big of influence throughout the board, but again, the other options are a bit more consistent with whole board thinking.]
;W[qj]WL[1705.282]C[I wanted to establish a base here to prevent having two very weak groups due to Black's immense thickness.]
;B[pr]BL[1740.75]C[Black's block is very big since it seals White in. This is tough for White to swallow.]
;W[ps]WL[1699.153]C[Not sure what I was thinking at this point, but this is very small.]
;B[os]BL[1739.046]LB[jp:A]C[Black should actually ignore and take the big point.]
;W[qs]WL[1698.246]
;B[or]BL[1738.264]LB[fq:A][gq:B]C[For those considering an approach move like A or B at this point, I dislike the approach in this situation since it gives Black the severe pincer which works wonderfully which is perfect thickness on the right.]
;W[jp]WL[1678.327]C[So White must take the large point now to try and negate Black's IMMENSE thickness.]
;B[gq]BL[1722.372]C[Correct direction by Black.]
;W[cn]WL[1660.099]TR[jp]C[Since the marked stone is high, there is no need to commit to it or really worry about it's safety at the moment.]
;B[co]BL[1716.593]LB[cj:B][dn:A]C[Black is hoping that White will stand at A and then pincer at B.]
;W[cj]WL[1613.845]C[But White must resist Black's plans.]
;B[dn]BL[1713.103]LB[cm:A]
;W[cf]WL[1611.385]LB[cm:A]C[Though playing at A is decent shape, it is too slow for handicap games as White.]
;B[cd]BL[1706.706]
;W[cm]WL[1601.066]C[Since Black responded solidly in the corner, White should try to stabilize the left before proceeding with other invasion/operations.]
;B[dm]BL[1704.169]
;W[dl]WL[1596.813]LB[cl:A]C[Understand that when I hane'd here, I had already double checked that the cut at A did not work for Black. ]
;B[el]BL[1702.685]
;W[dk]WL[1594.483]
;B[ek]BL[1701.39]
;W[ej]WL[1587.79]C[Though I hated the fact that I was helping Black build thickness toward the center, I needed to ensure that my group's shape was very resilient.]
;B[fj]BL[1699.595]
;W[gp]WL[1579.445]C[And now begins my counterattack. Do you know why I played here?]
;B[hp]BL[1661.228]C[Black resists.]
;W[em]WL[1572.345]C[Now the cuts here are much harder for Black to answer.]
;B[go]BL[1637.215]
;W[fp]WL[1552.355]C[I extend here to leave more aji for later if I want to use it.]
;B[fo]BL[1630.46]
;W[gm]WL[1545.661]C[Jump lightly.]
;B[hm]BL[1627.201]
;W[hl]WL[1529.779]LB[fk:A]C[I hane here in preparation for the cut at A.]
;B[im]BL[1620.683]

;B[fl]BL[1617.536]
;W[gk]WL[1511.805]
;B[fm]BL[1593.944]
;W[en]WL[1510.009]LB[fn:B][do:A]C[Miai for White.]
;B[fn]BL[1582.132]C[Black is correct. These stones are more important.]
;W[do]WL[1505.304]
;B[eo]BL[1581.109]

;W[mq]WL[1467.802]C[Trying to settle down here if possible.]

;W[lo]WL[1454.702]
;B[ln]BL[1560.662]
;W[kn]WL[1452.384]
;B[ko]BL[1558.78]
;W[jo]WL[1439.393]C[Never be afraid to let your opponent eat the tail of your dragon. As long as the main body does not die, you will be okay.]
;B[lp]BL[1555.883]
;W[lm]WL[1428.994]
;B[mm]BL[1553.489]
;W[ll]WL[1425.82]
;B[jk]BL[1550.351]
;W[lq]WL[1417.332]
;B[re]BL[1525.109]TR[qg][qj]C[This is a good preparatory move for attacking the marked White stones.]
;W[qc]WL[1413.803]C[I chose to 3-3 invade to poke holes in Black's shape.]
;B[pc]BL[1519.694]
;W[qe]WL[1393.19]

;W[ne]WL[1375.283]
;B[pf]BL[1485.41]
;W[fi]WL[1357.261]C[Now I choose to play the ladder out.]
;B[md]BL[1474.935]C[And now begins a battle for the ladder breaker.]
;W[le]WL[1302.004]
;B[jf]BL[1451.048]

;B[ie]BL[1435.519]

;B[jd]BL[1423.197]
;W[jg]WL[1221.639]
;B[if]BL[1411.684]C[So at this point, the ladder works in Black's favor, but White is satisfied with having gotten so many moves in teh center to stabilize his group, so the F10 stone is no longer important.]
;W[nd]WL[1215.785]
;B[nf]BL[1402.505]
;W[mf]WL[1207.025]
;B[ng]BL[1400.065]

;B[mi]BL[1392.467]
;W[mg]WL[1174.981]
;B[nh]BL[1383.089]TR[qe][rf][qg][qj]C[The marke group is now super weak. It is practically surrounded.]
;W[rl]WL[1142.621]C[So White must try to expand his eye space.]
;B[ig]BL[1375.114]
;W[jh]WL[1138.049]C[I extend to make living shape.]
;B[ih]BL[1373.581]
;W[fc]WL[1078.495]C[This invasion is an overplay, but White is behind on territory and needs to catch up somehow.]
;B[db]BL[1353.383]LB[ec:B][fe:A]C[This move by Black is too timid. The cap or kick would be far more severe. ]
;W[fe]WL[1072.687]C[White gets to easily jump out and is happy since the upper left has been destroyed.]
;B[fg]BL[1345.19]C[Black tries to cut off White.]
;W[eg]WL[1063.295]C[White wants to connect.]
;B[fh]BL[1341.925]
;W[ef]WL[1038.037]C[White removes the weakness of the knight's move connection.]
;B[eh]BL[1331.157]
;W[dh]WL[1035.801]C[Block Black from getting any further into White's terirtory.]
