;W[dp]WL[1793.209]
;B[qp]BL[1783.816]
;W[dd]WL[1788.188]
;B[oq]BL[1775.973]C[In all honesty, I'm shocked to see that I played this opening. I don't even remember using it. Haha.]
;W[lq]WL[1782.566]C[I had no idea how to respond to this.]
;B[cn]BL[1749.259]C[So I just approached the corner. What's kind of ironic is that this is the correct direction to approach from since it's wider. xD]
;W[fq]WL[1776.248]
;B[ck]BL[1740.108]LB[bp:A]C[This is not a bad move, but it's preferable to slide at A first and see what White wants to do. The reason it's not as efficient as Black would like it because of the next move.]
;W[co]WL[1769.215]C[This kick ends up making Black overconcentrated.]
;B[dn]BL[1737.527]LB[cj:B][ck:A]C[As you see now, Black's A stone would ideally be placed one more space over at B.]
;W[cg]WL[1766.556]
;B[fo]BL[1722.041]LB[jd:A][pj:B]C[I guess I was trying to limit his expansion, but the bigger areas are clearly A or B.]
;W[nc]WL[1760.626]
;B[pf]BL[1717.564]C[At this time, I'm not sure I realy understood the difference between the one space response versus the knight's response. ]
;W[jd]WL[1757.527]
;B[qk]BL[1689.286]C[I'm surprised I played here. It almost seems like I was trying to setup a Chinese fuseki (even though I had never even heard of it at the time).]
;W[ip]WL[1738.556]
;B[mp]BL[1656.141]C[I guess I'm trying to limit White's expansion here.]
;W[nr]WL[1732.143]
;B[or]BL[1650.943]C[Trying to protect my corner.]
;W[nq]WL[1729.706]
;B[np]BL[1648.476]C[Connecting.]
;W[mq]WL[1728.205]
;B[lp]BL[1637.393]C[Pushing because I'm only focused on the local area.]
;W[kp]WL[1719.486]
;B[ko]BL[1626.703]C[Hane to limit his expansion.]
;W[qh]WL[1714.951]
;B[qc]BL[1602.224]C[This is classic kyu thinking. Play the 4-4 and then rush to take or defend the corner as soon as possible. xD]
;W[oh]WL[1705.998]
;B[ph]BL[1589.207]C[This wedge is an overplay because White gets to choose the direction that works best for him. ]
;W[pi]WL[1687.687]
;B[pg]BL[1586.713]C[Must connect.]
;W[qj]WL[1683.727]
;B[oj]BL[1577.411]LB[oi:A]C[Here's a good example of the "peeping instead of cutting," which is a terrible habit that players need to get rid of. I should have just cut at A since the wedge is meant to separate White.]
;W[oi]WL[1679.117]C[Now White is connected and has pretty nice shape.]
;B[pj]BL[1572.743]C[Here is me trying to wall off territory in the lower right.]
;W[rj]WL[1662.87]
;B[nf]BL[1564.454]LB[rk:A]C[I'm surprised I tenuki'd here. I expected myself to block at A.]
;W[rf]WL[1659.729]
;B[rd]BL[1525.403]C[Again, with the slightest threat of entering what I thought was mine, I defended like an idiot.]
;W[qm]WL[1649.476]C[I remember that this invasion threw me off.  What do I do?! xD]
;B[pm]BL[1510.32]C[So like I usually did when I was lost, I just attached to my opponent's stone.]
;W[ql]WL[1642.14]
;B[pl]BL[1505.902]C[Trying to seal White in.]
;W[rk]WL[1639.694]
;B[qn]BL[1493.262]LB[pk:A]C[I'm really surprise I did not connect at A. Haha.]
;W[rn]WL[1621.74]
;B[ro]BL[1491.446]C[And I played the double hane?! Bravo past self. Haha.]
;W[rm]WL[1619.371]
;B[po]BL[1484.444]LB[pn:A]C[Though not entirely necessary, I wanted to repair the cut at A.]
;W[lk]WL[1615.148]C[When White played here, I saw the top area and it just looked huge. ]
;B[gd]BL[1457.182]LB[db:B][eb:C][cc:A][fc:D][hc:E][lc:F][ld:G]C[So I naturally invaded, but I think it's rather funny that I used to think that the whole top was about to White's territory in one move. Haha. So many holes...]
;W[fc]WL[1608.208]
;B[fd]BL[1450.649]C[I guess I ended up treating my invasion like a shoulder hit.]
;W[gc]WL[1605.599]
;B[ff]BL[1430.156]LB[hc:A]C[Probably would have been better to hane at A, but I was looking to take care of my group, which is not a bad thing at my level at the time.]
;W[ed]WL[1600.276]
;B[ee]BL[1414.557]C[Here's me trying to get good shape.]
;W[de]WL[1597.37]
;B[df]BL[1410.898]C[This double tiger's mouth was probably the only shape I really knew, so naturally I jumped at it.]
;W[cf]WL[1594.636]C[But now White's corner is so big. Haha.]
;B[dg]BL[1408.988]
;W[ci]WL[1591.2]
;B[dh]BL[1397.796]C[If there was anything I knew about shape then, it was to not let your opponent get that shape point. So though I didn't know it at the time, this extension at D12 is considered "taking away your opponent's vital point."]
;W[ch]WL[1587.806]
;B[di]BL[1391.557]C[This is bad since I'm just pushing from behind now.]
;W[hd]WL[1581.231]
;B[he]BL[1387.982]
;W[ie]WL[1579.014]
;B[hf]BL[1381.646]
;W[if]WL[1576.463]
;B[hc]BL[1372.556]C[And here I try some shenanigans, but I'm sure most of you realize that this can only end one way.]
;W[id]WL[1573.713]
;B[ec]BL[1368.469]LB[fb:A][gb:B]C[Threatening the ladder at A or B.]
;W[dc]WL[1565.28]
;B[eb]BL[1366.901]LB[gb:A]C[Threatening the atari at A.]
;W[hb]WL[1563.231]
;B[db]BL[1346.43]C[No idea what I was trying to do here.]
;W[cb]WL[1556.277]

;W[hc]WL[1531.229]
;B[ca]BL[1277.303]TR[cb][dc][bd][cd][dd][ed][de]C[Apparently I think I might be able to live or kill the marked White group....]
;W[bb]WL[1513.654]
;B[ba]BL[1240.559]C[Still trying...]
;W[ae]WL[1509.399]
;B[ab]BL[1224.111]C[Once more...]
;W[bf]WL[1486.879]C[Utter failure. Haha.]
;B[bo]BL[1186.265]SQ[bl][bm]C[Here I seem to be trying to protect my territory, but you should realize that there's not much there to begin with. Haha.]
;W[bp]WL[1484.218]
;B[bn]BL[1183.423]C[And in fact, White gets the better end of the deal since the corner is much more solid than before.]
;W[lm]WL[1472.55]
;B[ml]BL[1179.188]C[Here's me trying to protect my territory here (which is a terrible idea).]
;W[ll]WL[1470.378]
;B[mk]BL[1169.694]
;W[ln]WL[1462.175]
;B[lo]BL[1164.303]TR[ko]C[And here's an automatic response even though the marked stone is not important.]
;W[nn]WL[1457.581]C[Now Black has like nothing in the center.]
;B[kq]BL[1157.339]TR[lq][mq][nq][nr]C[Here is my valiant attempt to capture the marked stones.]
;W[jp]WL[1455.457]
;B[kr]BL[1153.592]C[Now just so you know, I had no idea if this was going to work.]
;W[lr]WL[1444.459]
;B[ls]BL[1140.062]C[My reading was practically nonexistent.]
;W[ms]WL[1436.868]
;B[ks]BL[1133.725]LB[os:A]C[I connected hoping that White would walk away and I could play A first. xD]
;W[jq]WL[1433.365]
;B[jr]BL[1114.717]C[Yup... No concept of reading... Look at the awful shape... xD]
;W[ir]WL[1431.46]
;B[hi]BL[1074.343]TR[kq][jr][kr][ks][ls]C[The tiny redemption I get is that  at least I recognized the marked stones were dead now.]
;W[lf]WL[1418.057]
;B[mh]BL[1064.1]C[Here's me trying to separate two very lively groups...]
;W[ne]WL[1408.07]
;B[me]BL[1054.111]C[Overly aggressive hane.]
;W[mf]WL[1406.01]
;B[le]BL[1031.443]C[Apparently I think I can make this work.]
;W[nd]WL[1400.141]
;B[kf]BL[1024.128]
;W[ng]WL[1393.223]C[Except I forgot about this atari.]
;B[of]BL[1019.645]C[I naturally connect since I'm still trying to pull off shenanigans.]
;W[mg]WL[1390.722]
;B[nh]BL[1011.619]C[And here's just me rubbing salt into the wound.]
;W[og]WL[1383.508]
;B[kh]BL[1001.73]C[This one point jump was kind of nice though (in regards to shape).]
;W[ke]WL[1377.454]
;B[lg]BL[960.466]C[And the double tiger's mouth appears again!]
;W[jf]WL[1366.317]
;B[jg]BL[946.284]LB[kg:A]C[Apparently by this point, I had learned that it was bad form to connect at A.]
;W[kg]WL[1361.012]C[Of course me being 14 kyu, I had no idea how to find ko threats.]
;B[lh]BL[943.388]C[So I just connected.]
;W[kf]WL[1351.17]
;B[ig]BL[936.862]C[Now I seal off White.]
;W[qg]WL[1313.428]
;B[qe]BL[921.037]C[Glad to see I had enough sense to at least make a ponnuki. Haha.]
;W[jl]WL[1305.831]
;B[hl]BL[888.732]C[I do like this move. It expands my center territory.]
;W[im]WL[1298.757]
;B[hm]BL[877.703]C[Here's me trying to attack the group. Notice how I'm pushing my opponent toward his own stones however. Haha. Not a good way to attack!]
