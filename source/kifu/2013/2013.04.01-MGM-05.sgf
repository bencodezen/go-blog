;B[pd]BL[1784.51]C[Today's game was submitted by Bonscott. And in case anyone is wondering why the game is even, Bonscott requested it. =)]
;W[dc]WL[1796.865]

;W[cp]WL[1765.951]
;B[eq]BL[1767.132]
;W[do]WL[1745.675]
;B[cr]BL[1753.58]LB[gp:A][hq:B]C[This is a small mistake on Black's part. Two commons responses to consider are A and B. The reason this is a mistake is due to the fact that it is the opening and playing on second line can be seen as rather submissive when other options are available.]
;W[fp]WL[1739.163]C[White takes this opportunity to press down on Black a bit.]
;B[fq]BL[1739.348]
;W[gp]WL[1737.09]
;B[bp]BL[1728.367]C[This attachment helps to solidify Black's life, but will give White very solid thickness.]
;W[bo]WL[1732.431]
;B[bq]BL[1727.625]
;W[dj]WL[1707.852]LB[di:A]C[This extension is timid of White, should be at A for the ideal five space extension.]
;B[ce]BL[1720.881]LB[fd:A]C[This approach is the wrong direction for Black. It is a classic example of kyu jealousy. White's left area is starting to look big, so Black leaps in. A would be a better direction.]
;W[cg]WL[1704.244]C[Unfortunately, White now has a target to harass and repair any potential open skirt issue with the D10 extension.]
;B[ee]BL[1716.203]
;W[fd]WL[1702.81]
;B[ec]BL[1703.673]LB[cc:A]C[Normally this attachment is made at A instead, I can't say this is bad, but it helps White solidify his group.]

;B[pc]BL[1688.774]
;W[me]WL[1641.517]LB[ld:A]C[White is probably better off not following joseki here and perhaps extend at A.]
;B[lc]BL[1670.828]C[Great peep by Black. Based on my reading, White cannot ignore this peep.]
;W[mc]WL[1630.823]
;B[ic]BL[1668.831]C[Black now settles his group in what was White's framework just three moves ago.]
;W[jd]WL[1598.404]
;B[gc]BL[1660.942]C[Nice sente move.]
;W[fc]WL[1594.39]
;B[he]BL[1660.087]LB[jc:A]C[This is too ambitious, Black should return to the connection at A.]
;W[jc]WL[1576.806]C[Now White can split the group.]
;B[jb]BL[1655.122]
;W[hb]WL[1562.372]
;B[ib]BL[1651.392]LB[gb:A]TR[db][eb][dc][fc][ed][fd]C[Black was probably better off blocking at A since it would threaten the life of the entire E18 group.]
;W[gb]WL[1560.924]C[Now White's group is settled.]

;W[gf]WL[1447.536]
;B[fa]BL[1538.186]C[Black believes he can kill the group. And he is right for every variation....]
;W[fb]WL[1442.342]C[Except this one. ^^]
;B[id]BL[1501.939]
;W[hf]WL[1423.247]
;B[ie]BL[1499.533]LB[if:A]C[Proper move is at A. Although the eye is false, it will better serve Black in his attempt to run for life.]

;B[mh]BL[1487.09]
;W[lg]WL[1382.806]
;B[jh]BL[1466.178]C[Good attempt on Black's part to not respond with convention moves like connecting.]
;W[jf]WL[1375.772]C[Unfortunately White also has this move.]
;B[kd]BL[1360.739]TR[jc][jd]C[Once again, major props to Black for trying to come up with a new way of defending his connections. Most kyu players would feel compelled to save the marked stones, however...]
;W[kg]WL[1364.454]C[Black only has one eye. ^^]

;B[rj]BL[1253.049]

;B[eg]BL[1236.462]
;W[df]WL[1255.749]C[Double peep. ]
;B[de]BL[1230.57]
;W[ef]WL[1253.242]C[This is an overplay on my part, and I pay dearly for it later.]
;B[ff]BL[1229.68]LB[fg:A]C[White cannot cut at A. See variation.]

;B[jg]BL[1207.027]
;W[fg]WL[1208.336]C[So I cut in anticipation of gaining a big center/left side.]
