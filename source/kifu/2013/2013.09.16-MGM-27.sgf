;B[pd]BL[2093.358]
;W[pp]WL[2082.036]
;B[dc]BL[2086.427]
;W[de]WL[2073.957]C[Interesting approach by White. I debated on responding to it directly, but realized that it would define the entire course of the game very quickly. So...]
;B[dp]BL[2051.674]C[I took the third empty corner and wanted to see what White had in mind.]
;W[cc]WL[2050.317]
;B[cb]BL[1968.526]
;W[cd]WL[2045.601]LB[eb:A]C[After this, classic joseki will have Black respond at A, but I felt it was a little slow and didn't like the idea of White getting sente. See variation for what I thought would happen if I played at A.]
(;B[gc]BL[1930.499]C[So I chose a more modern response.]
;W[ec]WL[2034.107]C[I'm pretty sure this is a bad move, but I can't find a way to take advantage of it.]
;B[eb]BL[1861.651]
;W[ed]WL[1974.923]
;B[qn]BL[1825.16]C[Though the upper left is not quite settled, I wanted to probe White's intentions here first.]
;W[pk]WL[1956.15]C[At this point, it's pretty clear that White is looking to fight.]
;B[on]BL[1734.657]
;W[np]WL[1949.126]
;B[rp]BL[1723.906]
;W[qq]WL[1944.092]
;B[rk]BL[1687.788]C[So I choose to settle down quickly and ensure all my groups are strong before heavy fighting breaks out.]
;W[qj]WL[1934.921]
;B[rj]BL[1669.615]C[Though this is pushing along the "line of defeat," I wanted to prevent White from easily sealing me in later and further secure my group by only pushing once.]
;W[qh]WL[1916.757]
;B[pi]BL[1634.941]LB[qf:A][jq:B]C[In hindsight, this was way too aggressive. A move like A or B would be more in tune with profit minded playing along with whole board thinking. But if you're wondering what I was intending, it was to make him heavy so I could attack it later.]
;W[qi]WL[1910.141]
;B[qf]BL[1632.053]
;W[pf]WL[1891.366]C[White's attachment here is further indication of his/her desire to turn this into a bloody match.]
;B[pg]BL[1587.709]C[After some reading, I aggressive hande here because I know that White can't cut.]
;W[qg]WL[1887.244]C[White doesn't agree though.]
;B[of]BL[1580.622]C[And now Black capture White in a ladder to the left.]
;W[qe]WL[1800.578]C[So White counter atari's.]
;B[pe]BL[1550.067]
;W[rf]WL[1796.522]
;B[pf]BL[1543.86]
;W[qd]WL[1789.242]C[And I was happy to make such thick position. White had not really gained much on the right yet since my S10 stone was undercutting his territory. So based on my understanding, overall this is a gain for Black.]
;B[qc]BL[1501.611]
;W[rc]WL[1749.024]
;B[rb]BL[1437.912]C[This double hane was a little too aggressive again. Not really needed.]
;W[rd]WL[1702.66]C[White chooses secure life.]
;B[pc]BL[1422.71]LB[jd:A]C[And then I choose to repair the cutting point, but in reality, a move at A would probably be much larger in terms of whole board thinking.]
;W[id]WL[1697.618]C[White takes advantage of this right away.]
;B[ge]BL[1419.519]C[So my first aim is to separate White while helping my weak group.]
;W[hd]WL[1691.499]
;B[gd]BL[1390.783]
;W[ld]WL[1676.995]C[I thought this was a nice move by White since it doesn't commit him to living on the top but provides flexible shape while negating my wall.]
;B[if]BL[1367.8]C[Here I try to attack the White group and possibly kill it, which let me remind my readers, this is completely unreasonable.]
;W[lf]WL[1651.261]
;B[lh]BL[1359.398]C[I'm trying my best to use my thickness by attacking, but at the time I was definitely thinking about a way to kill as well.]
;W[kg]WL[1646.473]
;B[ke]BL[1323.186]C[Again, super aggressive with only killing in mind. Black should try to find a way to profit instead.]
;W[je]WL[1614.332]C[This move gives Black the chance he needs to start a fight in his favor.]
;B[jf]BL[1306.338]
;W[kf]WL[1528.626]
;B[jd]BL[1296.487]
;W[ie]WL[1503.959]
;B[kd]BL[1295.33]C[When getting into a fight, the most important thing is to keep your opponent separated while not dying. If you can successfully keep your opponent split, you will indefinitely profit.]
;W[hf]WL[1452.755]C[And thus begins a very complicated fight.]
;B[jh]BL[1270.519]C[Saving my cutting stones.]
;W[jg]WL[1408.181]
;B[ig]BL[1268.279]
;W[ic]WL[1349.116]C[This is an odd move by White, but I believe his/her aim was to separate me. ]
;B[le]BL[1250.596]C[Fortunately, I already had this push sequence read out and was not worried.]
;W[ih]WL[1249.48]
;B[hg]BL[1247.259]
;W[gf]WL[1196.887]C[Here is the next unreasonable move by White. ]
;B[he]BL[1227.669]LB[ie:2][gf:1][kf:3]C[Black is happy to split White into three major groups now. Black's thickness on the right is really going to come into play now.]
;W[lc]WL[1097.236]
;B[kh]BL[1208.596]C[Removing forcing moves and cutting points.]
;W[jc]WL[1057.539]
;B[me]BL[1176.317]LB[mf:A]C[In this case, I believe extending is better than atari at A since it doesn't give White a forcing move at N15.]
;W[gg]WL[1051.56]
;B[hh]BL[1163.976]
;W[gh]WL[1040.334]
;B[hi]BL[1162.463]
;W[hb]WL[991.141]
;B[gb]BL[1139.349]
;W[da]WL[944.837]C[White is clearly now trying to counter attack and kill my left group.]
;B[db]BL[1059.007]
;W[bb]WL[931.569]
;B[kc]BL[1018.067]C[But I decide that I can win this capturing race.]
;W[kb]WL[922.091]
;B[lb]BL[1004.234]
;W[jb]WL[829.909]
;B[mb]BL[985.365]
;W[ia]WL[719.274]
;B[ka]BL[981.891]
;W[ca]WL[541.77]
;B[fe]BL[843.174]C[I figure I would gain more liberties since I was confident I would win the capturing race.]
;W[fb]WL[504.766]
;B[fc]BL[830.78]
;W[ff]WL[471.887]
;B[ee]BL[801.477]C[This is my mistake. This removes my liberty and gives White a chance.]
;W[ef]WL[466.542]
;B[fa]BL[799.564]
;W[dd]WL[448.533]
;B[hc]BL[788.91]
;W[ba]WL[440.786]LB[ea:A][ga:B]C[Black cannot connect at A since it gives White an opportunity to start a ko at B.]
;B[la]BL[771.727]
;W[ja]WL[425.632]
;B[ha]BL[751.146]C[By playing this sequence out instead, White now much win a multi-step ko.]
;W[ga]WL[421.547]
;B[sc]BL[708.822]
;W[ea]WL[401.725]
;B[ha]BL[707.189]
;W[pm]WL[307.573]C[I thought getting cut off would hurt, I didn't think I had a big enough threat. In addition, responding would give White more forcing moves and there was no guarantee I'd live.]
;B[ib]BL[702.138]C[So I ended the ko fight.]
;W[pn]WL[303.889]C[White cut.]
;B[qm]BL[694.212]TR[rj]C[And now you can see the power of the S10 move right? My groups is MUCH more stable as a result.]
;W[ql]WL[289.758]
;B[rl]BL[691.463]
;W[qo]WL[287.32]
;B[ro]BL[686.628]
;W[rq]WL[264.565]
;B[sm]BL[659.601]
;W[sp]WL[244.334]
;B[rn]BL[645.114]
;W[gi]WL[211.645]C[White's push here is slow. ]
;B[cm]BL[610.237]C[His thickness is pretty incredible though, so I only do a large knight's move to try and negate some of his influence.]
;W[dn]WL[145.216]C[An odd move by White, again trying to provoke a fight, but this time I'm well aware of the fact that I have a ton of cash and do not need to be pulled in by White's antics.]
;B[cj]BL[593.516]
;W[cn]WL[139.379]
;B[cg]BL[591.649]C[And with a double two-spaced extension, I figured I would easily live and not to mention all of White's territory on the left is pretty much gone now.]
;W[dh]WL[113.668]
;B[ch]BL[588.007]
;W[cp]WL[105.932]
;B[cq]BL[548.016]
;W[dq]WL[90.819]
;B[ep]BL[542.888]
;W[eq]WL[87.121]
;B[fq]BL[528.867]
;W[fp]WL[54.862]C[Here again is another example of White being unreasonable, but perhaps White thought the ladder was broken on both sides.]
;B[dr]BL[514.151]
;W[er]WL[49.832]
;B[fr]BL[512.724]C[I guess he forgot he was on the second line. I don't have to hane. =D]
;W[eo]WL[44.124]
;B[es]BL[510.384]C[Corner/bottom is now super alive. ]
;W[cl]WL[37.527]C[Time to take care of the left to preserve my win.]
;B[bl]BL[502.166]
;W[dm]WL[33.271]
;B[bm]BL[497.189]
;W[ck]WL[21.608]
;B[bk]BL[495.304]
;W[dj]WL[9.472]
;B[ci]BL[487.849]
;W[di]WL[5.393]
;B[be]BL[465.104]C[Probably unnecessary, but I wasn't sparing a chance since I knew White made a lot of overplays.]
;W[cf]WL[35]OW[5]
;B[bf]BL[460.921]
;W[jq]WL[35]OW[5]
;B[gl]BL[444.211]C[Since I'm strong everywhere, this reduction/invasion was reasonable for me to play.]
;W[hj]WL[35]OW[5]
;B[il]BL[413.278]
;W[hk]WL[35]OW[5]LB[hl:A]C[Many kyu players will consider A as a possibilitym but this is terribly heavy and only serves to give White a group to attack/kill.]
;B[gp]BL[397.499]C[So play lightly! ]
;W[hl]WL[35]OW[5]
;B[gn]BL[393.736]C[Light play again!]
;W[fo]WL[35]OW[5]
;B[go]BL[391.846]
;W[hm]WL[35]OW[5]
;B[gm]BL[387.259]TR[jh][kh][lh][gl][gm][gn][go][gp][fq][fr]C[And now White's territory is heavy reduced once again. Not to mention his center will be near impossible to solidify since I have strong positions from the top and left.]
;W[kk]WL[35]OW[5]
;B[ij]BL[381.77]
;W[ik]WL[35]OW[5]
;B[dl]BL[372.36]C[Saw this little tesuji that would let me kill the entire lower left corner if White did not respond correctly.]
(;W[el]WL[35]OW[5]C[White sees the threat and responds correctly.]
;B[dk]BL[370.368]
;W[ek]WL[35]OW[5]C[And the best part is I get sente back!]
;B[jo]BL[340.402]C[So it's time to keep reducing!]
;W[io]WL[35]OW[5]
;B[ip]BL[327.012]
;W[jp]WL[35]OW[5]
;B[in]BL[324.646]
;W[jn]WL[35]OW[5]LB[ko:A]C[This is again very unreasonable. The atari at A would make more sense for White since it starts to solidify his bottom.]
;B[ko]BL[320.003]C[So I have no problem quickly punishing White's mistake.]
;W[hn]WL[35]OW[5]
;B[ho]BL[317.656]
;W[im]WL[35]OW[5]
;B[io]BL[314.797]
;W[kn]WL[35]OW[5]
;B[lo]BL[306.424]LB[ab:D][se:C][fh:B][lq:A]C[White resigns here. At this point, the best White can do is solidify the bottom, but otherwise, his only points are from the B, C, and D area and those probably don't amount to much more 15 or so points.])
(;W[dk]C[If White atari's from this end.]
;B[el]TR[dm][cn][dn][eo][fo][cp][fp]C[White's marked stones are cut off and have practically no chance at living.]))
(;B[eb]
;W[ch]
;B[fd]C[Black must respond here if I'm not mistaken. I didn't like how White had a lot of options through this variation.]))
