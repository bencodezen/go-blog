;B[qd]BL[1788.897]C[Submitted by DeepSnow

I know... a dan level game being reviewed by a kyu player? Blasphemy you might say. But I have some help from DeepSnow, so hopefully you'll learn something new!]

;W[dc]WL[1728.288]
;B[oc]BL[1779.284]
;W[qn]WL[1719.815]LB[qj:A]C[The splitting move at A is also a common respones to Black's formation.]
;B[ql]BL[1758.779]

;B[qo]BL[1750.659]
;W[nq]WL[1669.902]TR[pf][qf][pg][qg][ph][qh][pi][qi][pj][qj]C[Although Black's right side is starting to look huge, remember that there are many invaison points in the marked area ]
;B[id]BL[1718.55]C[Instead of a corner approach, Black makes an ideal 5 space extension while starting to threaten a big framework.]
;W[rd]WL[1617.152]C[Based on my understanding thus far, this move is called a "probe." The idea is to ask Black, "What do you value more? The top/corner? Or the side?]
;B[qc]BL[1691.671]C[Black says, "The top/corner!"]
;W[gc]WL[1601.149]C[Based on that response White chose his response to the initial approach at J16. This undercuts Black's top potential and establishes a base for the D17 stone.]
;B[re]BL[1681.397]C[Black wants to eliminate any aji from this stone, but this seems rather slow in the opening. And White has no problem letting Black firmly capture that stone since the corner was already Black's to begin with (since Black already had a shimari).]
;W[ci]WL[1536.67]LB[di:A]C[With that slow move, White is happy to take the next biggest point and form the Chinese opening. I will have to say that it seems a little cramped with the two space extension at G17, so an alternative to consider is the high Chinese opening at A.]
;B[ge]BL[1668.576]C[This is a rather lackluster move. Doesn't seem to have a real aim other than semi-capping the group.]
;W[np]WL[1486.308]LB[de:A]C[Although White tenuki's to play here, I think that a response at A would've been viable as well since is strengthens the group and starts to solidify the left/corner for points.]

;W[kl]WL[1012.355]
;B[lk]BL[1371.349]C[I may be wrong, but it seems that Black may be slightly better off in this exchange since White's bottom is still plenty invadeable.]
;W[kd]WL[1006.673]LB[ic:A]C[Nice invasion that threatens to connect/make eye shape with the attachment at A.]
;B[hc]BL[1352.134]C[Black prevents this.]
;W[lh]WL[866.968]TR[kd]C[Notice that White did not immediately try to force the marked stone to live. This is a good example of playing light.

(;W[mq]WL[184.693]LB[oq:A]C[There is a saying that playing atari is generally a vulgar move since it helps your opponent. This is an example of that since it doesn't quite protect the push at A, nor does it enable White to capture the N4 stone.]

;W[ko]WL[180.45]
;B[lq]BL[851.083]LB[oq:A]C[See what I mean? The push at A is bad aji that is still there.]
;W[go]WL[129.095]
;B[lr]BL[839.47]
;W[nr]WL[87.448]TR[mq]C[White response here is further confirmati on of why N3 (the marked stone) was a bad move. Not only does White have bad shape now, but Black is also significantly stronger than before.]
;B[jp]BL[820.621]C[White to play. Where would you play?]
(;W[gj]WL[52.092]C[Although White plays here, this is too passive. See variation for the better move.]
