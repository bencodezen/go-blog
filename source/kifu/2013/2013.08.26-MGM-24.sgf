;B[qd]BL[895.25]
;W[dd]WL[895.167]C[When your opponent chooses a 3-4 opening, unless you are afraid of cross-fuseki, always open with a star point or a 3-4 with the strong side facing its weak side. Otherwise, you're already going to be at a disadvantage from Move 2.]
;B[dp]BL[891.405]
;W[pp]WL[881.709]C[For cross-fuseki, I like to keep things simple with two star points. This always provides some flexibility regarding how to deal with the strong side of the strong side of the 3-4 in the upper right.]
;B[oc]BL[889.509]
;W[qn]WL[861.148]C[I played this move with the intention of negating the influence of the shimari in the upper right, but this is a SLOW move. In other words, this is a BAD move in this situation since Black already has his shimari ready.]
;B[qj]BL[881.651]C[Here Black properly punished my slow move since he still gets his ideal extension.]
;W[cn]WL[850.966]C[This was a probe to find out Black's intentions.]
;B[fq]BL[875.298]
;W[jd]WL[840.831]C[There is a proverb that says to never let your opponent get a double winged formation. In other words, if you imagine Black having a stone at K16 instead, it is a rather fearsome formation for White to handle is it not? =)]
;B[ci]BL[864.064]
;W[cg]WL[804.825]LB[ck:A]C[I decided to push from this end because I thought my C6 stone had the option of diving for the 3-3. In reality though, it might have been better to take my own two point extension at C9 instead.]
;B[cl]BL[861.547]
;W[cq]WL[800.655]C[I dive into the corner as planned.]
;B[cp]BL[859.454]C[The following sequence is joseki.]
;W[bp]WL[799.171]C[Hane to threaten to connect.]
;B[bo]BL[858.214]C[Black blocks.]
;W[bq]WL[798.442]LB[co:A]C[Connect solidly while threatening to cut at A.]
;B[co]BL[856.199]C[Protect the cut by connecting solidly.]
;W[er]WL[797.761]C[Knight's move to expand eye shape.]
;B[fr]BL[854.198]C[Solid descent to block and seal White in.]
;W[eq]WL[796.744]C[Standing up to expand eye space and threaten to break out into the center.]
;B[fp]BL[848.359]C[Standard response is at E4, so I guess Black was trying to go for a solid wall.]
;W[dq]WL[792.558]C[I connect here to make solid life.]
;B[ep]BL[845.529]C[Black connects to prevent the push and cut and White now has sente.]
;W[oq]WL[751.301]C[At this point I'm thinking of negating the influence of the wall, but once again this is rather tight and slow considering Black can still get an ideal extension.]
;B[lp]BL[838.517]LB[gp:1][hp:2][ip:3][jp:4][kp:5]C[5 space extension. 'Nuff said.]
;W[jp]WL[746.816]C[Since I'm strong on the lower right  corner though, I decide it's a good time to invade.]
;B[ln]BL[832.919]
;W[jn]WL[733.862]
;B[lc]BL[823.204]C[This makes Black's upper right a little larger, but I didn't have a really good response for this. ]
;W[dk]WL[663.291]TR[ln][lp]C[So I thought I would do a leaning attack and see what I got from here before resuming a possible attack on the marked Black stones.]
;B[dl]BL[819.53]
;W[ek]WL[628.541]
;B[el]BL[816.879]
;W[ck]WL[613.521]C[Here's probably my first big mistake of the game. Even though my intention is to cut, I end up pushing from behind. I was a little too focused on cutting off the group and hopefully turing the upper left into territory.]
;B[ei]BL[814.93]
;W[fl]WL[550.679]
;B[fm]BL[804.081]
;W[gm]WL[534.361]C[This double hane is my second mistake.]
;B[fk]BL[800.117]
;W[gl]WL[532.356]
;B[fj]BL[798.965]
;W[em]WL[521.069]
;B[dm]BL[797.649]
;W[fn]WL[505.479]
;B[dn]BL[788.849]C[Now Black's group are pretty much connected and my shoulder hit at D9 was completely useless.]
;W[oj]WL[431.122]TR[ln][lp]C[Here I try to compensate for my loss by leaning on the middle stone to hopefully gain some traction to attack the marked Black stones.]
;B[ll]BL[780.374]C[But Black notices right away.]
;W[jl]WL[422.477]
;B[lj]BL[776.627]
;W[ol]WL[346.226]C[Here I want to keep the groups firmly separated while starting to connect my groups.]
;B[pl]BL[773.219]
;W[pk]WL[305.531]
;B[oi]BL[771.224]
;W[qk]WL[281.391]C[Firmly cut the groups apart.]
;B[pj]BL[762.122]
;W[rj]WL[266.107]
;B[ri]BL[760.761]
;W[rk]WL[221.261]
;B[qi]BL[751.695]LB[pl:1][ql:3][rl:5][sl:7][pm:2][qm:4][rm:6][sm:8]C[Gain sente, but I think Black gains a better exchange since the upper right is really starting to turn into solid territory. White only expanded his bottom right by maybe 8 points.]
;W[lg]WL[156.072]
;B[nj]BL[748.683]
;W[ng]WL[120.854]C[Here's my trying to destroy whatever territory I can.]

;B[gd]BL[711.601]
