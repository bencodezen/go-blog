;B[pq]C[In this game with frozen, I decide to try alternating 3-4.]

;B[fq]
;W[cn]
;B[jp]LB[hp:A][lp:C][mp:D][np:E][hq:B]C[For those who haven't noticed, I'm a bit partial to this move due to its speed; but realize that there are lots of invasion points.]
;W[qn]
;B[nc]C[Experimenting with the large knight enclosure.]
;W[de]
;B[qk]C[I decide I will play a dual purpose pincer and extension that is reminiscent of the chinese opening.
]
;W[qq]C[The only problem is that in this scenario, Black is now one move behind.]
;B[pp]C[I decide to let White live in exchange for a wall.]

;B[ok]C[I thought this would be good since it builds the right side, but notice how White is very safe and this is actually rather lackluster.]
;W[nm]C[Here is an example of a seemingly "slow" move that has a wide effect on the board as a whole. It limits Black's potential on the bottom while giving White access to the center.]
;B[ci]C[Trying to split White while possibly aiming for his weak side on top.]

;B[fo]
;W[en]
;B[el]LB[kp:1][mp:2][np:3]C[At this point, I am feeling pretty good about my bottom moyo; but as frozen points out in our lesson, all the numbered points are possible invasions that Black will have a difficult time killing.]
;W[ne]
;B[pg]C[Here is me trying to make something out of my right side.]
;W[pf]
;B[of]
;W[pd]C[Excellent white play for sabaki.]
;B[pc]LB[pe:A]C[I play a bit submissively here. Since Black wanted to turn the right side into territory, the wedge at A makes more sense.]

;W[rk]C[So the question here is, did White gain? ]
;B[pd]C[The answer is yes. Black's corner was already his to begin with since he spent two moves enclosing it. So White being able to settle his group on the right side (where Black wanted to make territory) is a gain.]
;W[jd]
;B[gm]C[Here I try to think on a grand scale to make my bottom moyo huge.]
;W[jf]C[This is an example of playing a "slow move" while in reality it is working very well on a whole scale. This move is effective because it expands the upper left while reducing the potential for Black in the center.]
;B[gg]C[Here is where the game ended since we began discussing different aspects of the game. But the lightbulb moment for me was starting to understand the difference between active and passive moyos. And how moves like F5 actually only grow the moyo by a few points instead of the large number we think. ]
;W[jh]LB[ng:1][og:2][nh:3][oh:4][ni:5][oi:6][oj:7]C[For example: If we take Black's moyo in the center. One can expect to possibly get 8 points from thie area (including the prisoner).]
;B[li]LB[mh:1][mi:2][nj:3]TR[ng][og][nh][oh][ni][oi][oj]C[When Black plays a move such as this, the gain in points is actually only about 3 points if even that. The passive moyo being what already existed, and the active being what's trying to be grown. ]
;W[jj]C[The teaching game ended here. I know it might still seem confusing, but I hope to one day be able to explain it a little more clearly the process that occurred that help me see the difference between active and passive moyos. Hope this helped!])
