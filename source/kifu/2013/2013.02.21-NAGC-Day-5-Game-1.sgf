;W[cf]LB[ec:A]C[The double approach was probably bad. I think just pushing at A would've been good enough. It would've prevented being hane'd at both ends of my stones.]

;W[qc]LB[pb:A]TR[nc][le][me][ne][ng]C[This 3-3 invasion was a mistake in hindsight. The triangle group is already weak, and the opponent will most likely seal me in and further weaken my group. A would have been better.]
