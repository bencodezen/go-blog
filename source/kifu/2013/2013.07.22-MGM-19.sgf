;W[dd]C[Up till now, I am still partial to opening on the star point since it provides the most flexibility and also provides good support for the fighting that is inevitable.]MN[1]
;B[dj]LB[pj:B][jp:A]C[While a big strategic point in terms of preparing for an attack on White, A or B would provide more synergy with Black's handicap stones.]
;W[jp]C[So I take the most point with the highest synergy value at this point.]
;B[jd]
;W[pj]LB[md:1][dm:2][pp:3]C[Since Black chose not to take sanrensei, I have to do what I can to break up any final remaining synergy between the handicap stones. Notice how Black is already more or less divided up into 3 groups. This is good for White.]
;B[ph]
;W[qn]LB[ql:A]C[Jumping low here is a overplay since Black can simply invade at A and cause mayhem for White, but such is the nature of playing White in handicap games.]
;B[pn]C[The attachment here is good since it allows Black to gain strength while overconcentrating White.]
;W[pm]
;B[on]
;W[qo]
;B[qp]
;W[fq]LB[np:A]C[I played here in hopes of having Black respond on the left side and hopefully returning back to A.]
;B[lq]C[No such luck... xD]
;W[dn]C[So I decide to continue harrassing the left side.]
;B[fp]TR[dn]C[Once again, the attachment is a good plan to build power to attack the marked group.]
;W[ep]C[Except I wasn't going to make it that easy...]
;B[eo]
;W[eq]
;B[do]
;W[fo]C[Cut!]
;B[gp]
;W[en]C[Try to link up!]
;B[fn]
;W[go]
;B[ho]
;W[gn]
;B[fm]
;W[hp]C[More cutting!!!]
;B[gq]
;W[hn]
;B[io]
;W[hq]
;B[gr]C[UTTER CHAOS!!!!! (White's best friend)]
;W[hr]
;B[dq]
;W[gs]
;B[cn]
;W[np]C[Take away White's shape.]
;B[op]LB[lo:A]C[This is good shape, but perhaps A would have been more proactive.]
;W[nq]
;B[or]
;W[fc]LB[lp:A]C[This is super overplay, I should have connected at A.]
;B[dr]C[Great sente move that protects the corner.]
;W[fr]
;B[lo]TR[np][nq]C[Now my two stones are pretty much squashed.]
;W[cg]
;B[qd]
;W[qh]
;B[qg]
;W[el]C[Now I'm feeling desperate and feeling reckless...]

;W[gb]
;B[dc]
;W[fa]
;B[da]
;W[gc]
;B[dl]TR[da][eb][fb][bc][cc][dc][cd]C[So actually, Black's shape on top is not alive yet. But this is where White has the upperhand...]
;W[dk]C[Since Black believes he's alive, White solidifies more of his position before trying to kill the corner.]

;W[mc]C[Keep Black divided and try to use the thickness on the left.]
;B[jf]
;W[ie]LB[ke:A]C[Make Black heavy, although I poked fro the wrong side in hindsight. A would make more sense.]
;B[je]
;W[mf]C[Now my group is weaker.]

;B[rl]C[At this point, I should have taken care of the lower right group better; but I got anxious about Black securing life in the upper left...]
;W[ac]C[And decided to go for the kill.]
;B[ab]
;W[bb]
;B[ba]LB[ad:A]C[This is a mistake by Black. He should have taken the ko at A instead.]
;W[aa]C[Now White is in a much more favorable position to win the ko.]
;B[me]C[When I saw this, I thought I could fight my way out.]
;W[ca]C[So I resolved the ko.]

;B[ib]

;B[ha]C[But I misread this portion and thought I could connect at K19, not realizing it would put me one move behind in the capturing race.]
