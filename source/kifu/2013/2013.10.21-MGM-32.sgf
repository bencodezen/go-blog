;B[pp]
;W[dq]C[Strong side of 3-4 komoku facing the star point.]
;B[pd]
;W[dc]C[Strong side of 3-4 komoku facing the star point. ]
;B[pj]C[For those who don't know, White's formation is actually good for countering the sanrensei, so be sure to try it out if you fear the sanrensei.]
;W[nq]LB[pn:B][lq:A]C[When White approaches here, the expectation is either A or B will be played.]
;B[np]C[This attachment is played with the intention of building thickness towards the Q10 stone, but it's a little passive considering that sanrensei is meant to be an attacking fuseki where the objective is fast development through speedy moves.]
;W[qq]LB[mp:A]C[Normal response is generally at A, but I decided to invade the 3-3 now since I have also resolved to playing a territorial game and I did not want to give Black his thickness and a corner..]
;B[qp]C[Black blocks here as expected.]
;W[pq]C[So I naturally extend to further secure my group.]
;B[op]LB[oq:A]C[I was expecting the push here, but I think Black wanted sente.]
;W[oq]C[Though it might make some players cringe to give Black sente at this point, I felt that my profit was okay and I would rather secure my shape now than later.]
;B[lp]LB[mq:A]C[With this move, Black is threatening to seal White in with the hane at A. ]
;W[nc]LB[mq:A]C[Although I really wanted to take away Black's shape point at A, I felt it was too passive and decided it was time to approach the top.]
;B[mq]C[Black really wants to seal White in.]
;W[rp]C[So I got ahead and secure my group in sente.]
;B[ro]
;W[rq]
;B[qn]
;W[qf]C[And now I aim to punish Black and make his sanrensei look silly.]
;B[nd]C[Seeing as how Black attached at the bottom, it should be no surprise that he does the same here.]
;W[md]TR[qf]C[This time though, since I have the marked stone, I decide to follow joseki.]
;B[ne]
;W[pi]LB[oc:A][pc:B]C[The normal continuation now is at A or B, but I decided that it would be better to attach here to see what Black's intentions were and start making sabaki in Black's sphere of influence.]
;B[qi]C[This hane tells me Black wants to hang on to his Q8 area.]
;W[ph]LB[of:C][nh:B][qh:A][mi:D]C[So I calmly extend to prepare for a connection back to the Q14 stone and also give myself options for Black's inevitable attack.]
;B[qh]C[Black pushes here to remove any easy base for White.]
;W[oc]C[And now I feel I have enough stones in the area to continue the joseki and hopefully gain an advantage.]
;B[pg]C[This is a bit painful for White since he has had both heads of his stones hit, but the goal here is to play lightly and simply reduce the power of Black's sanrensei.]
;W[nj]LB[nh:A][nl:B]TR[ph][pi]C[So I make this light jump that threatens to make good shape with A or just sacrifice the two marked stones and just make a reducition on the P8 area.]
;B[og]
;W[nh]C[Since Black didn't remove either shape points, I went ahead and took it to maximize my options for later on.]
;B[qg]C[Black protects his cutting point, but this felt passive by Black.]
;W[qc]C[So I decide that now is a good time to take away the corner from Black and force Black to be overconcentrated.]
;B[qd]
;W[pc]LB[mc:A]C[Solid connection since there is still a cut waiting at A.]
;B[me]
;W[ld]LB[mc:A]C[Solid extension along the 4th line while protecting the cut at A, White is happy]
;B[le]
;W[kd]TR[nh][ph][pi][nj]C[Now keep in mind, while White is happy to get 4th line territory, the marked White group is getting weaker with each push.]
;B[ke]
;W[jd]C[Even though I'm aware my group is getting weaker, I decide to continue extending  to keep good shape. ]
;B[je]C[Remember, if you're going to invade and reduce your opponents moyo, it's critical that you only have ONE weak group to take care of. Any more than that and you will have quite the uphill battle.]
;W[id]TR[nh][ph][pi][nj]C[I decide that the fourth line territory is too good to give up and I also had faith in my abilities to live in Black's influence. Otherwise, white should consider reinforcing his marked group.]
;B[mi]C[And Black finally goes for the kill!]
;W[nl]C[When you're in your opponent's sphere of influence, the key thing to remember is to play LIGHTLY. In other words, DO NOT try to save everything.]
;B[ni]C[Black really seems to want those stones...]
;W[oj]C[So I use a forcing move while I have a chance and strengthen my own connection.]
;B[oi]
;W[kk]C[And now I play the long horse nose jump to keep with playing lightly.]
;B[lk]
;W[lj]LB[ll:A]C[When I hane here, realize that my aim is to connect on the bottom.]
;B[mj]
;W[ll]
;B[mk]
;W[pk]C[Use a forcing move now to maximize my options later on.]
;B[oh]
;W[km]C[This hanging connection doesn't work, but I was trying to simply reduce black's potential.]
;B[ml]
;W[mm]
;B[nm]C[This cut is to be expected.]
;W[nn]C[But now I can continue to push Black into an overconcentrated position.]
;B[om]
;W[ki]LB[mn:A]C[Though the cut at A exists, I decide that it's bigger to reach out in the center while reducing Black's potential in the M13 area.]
;B[li]
;W[kj]C[Connect.]
;B[mn]C[Though this cut is a gain for Black, I thought it was small in regards to the whole board.]
;W[ie]C[So now I turn and threaten to make very large top territory.]
;B[lm]C[Black captures thinking it's sente.]
;W[de]C[But this seemed MUCH bigger at the time, not to mention my group is unlikely to really die.]
;B[kl]C[Black again tries to prove that he is correct.]
;W[ig]C[And I'm happy to just continue building the top.]
;B[jl]
;W[gq]TR[jl][kl][lm][mn][lp][mq]C[With Black's imposing thickness on the right now, I decide on a simple two space extension to prevent him from using is effectively.]
;B[jh]C[This move was nice by Black.]
;W[ih]C[I decide to go ahead and sacrifice them while building the left.]
;B[ii]
;W[ij]LB[hi:A]C[Here was short-sightedness on my part. I lost track of the whole board when I suddenly saw a possibiliy of running out my stones. I should have just hane'd at A.]
;B[hi]C[Black's extension here is very painful now since White potential is now limited.]
;W[ik]C[Unfortunately, there is no way to fix my mistake, so I must continue on with my plan to save the stones.]
;B[ji]
;W[hl]
;B[cg]TR[hi]C[So painful to have Black approach on my weak side and to have the H11 stone sticking out like a sore thumb. Sigh.]
;W[dg]C[I attach here with the intention of trying to salvage my wall at J15.]
;B[df]
;W[ef]C[Atari from the outside to try and salvage the area as much as poaaible.]
;B[cf]
;W[ce]C[Block the corner territory.]
;B[dh]
;W[eg]C[Connect to continue a possible attack on the group.]
;B[ci]
;W[bf]C[Hane to protect the corner and possibly attack Black's base.]
;B[bg]
;W[be]
;B[cl]
;W[co]C[Corner enclosure.]
;B[eo]C[Nice reduction by Black.]
;W[cm]C[Extension to gain some territory while threatening to invade Black's formation.]
;B[dl]
;W[en]C[Here I attach to fight back and see if I can gain some ground in this area.]
;B[go]
;W[fp]LB[eq:A]C[Peep to try and make Black heavy while preventing the attachment at A (which is a nice reduction tactic).]
;B[fn]
;W[fo]C[Happy to cut.]
;B[em]
;W[dn]TR[ki][ij][kj][lj][ik][kk][hl]C[With this exchange, I was pretty happy since my corner was pretty big, but I realized a bit too late that my marked group was pretty much dead now. Oy vey...]
;B[gm]C[Black definitely had better whole board vision for this sequence.]
;W[fi]C[Here I try to do some damage control.]
;B[gj]
;W[rd]C[At this point, I can't tell if I'm ahead, so I focus my energy and finding sente moves and whatever big points are left.]
;B[re]LB[rc:A]C[Most players are probably thinking I'll connect at A now...]
;W[od]C[But I had a more diabolical plan. xD]
;B[oe]
;W[qe]
;B[rf]C[Black decides to play it safe and keep his territory.]
;W[pe]
;B[io]TR[ki][ij][kj][lj][ik][kk][hl]C[Black is clearly trying to prevent me from pulling out my marked stones, but this feels a little slow.]
;W[jg]C[So I resume my search for sente moves.]
;B[kh]
;W[kg]
;B[lg]
;W[fj]
;B[gk]
;W[iq]C[Simple one point jump to gain territory while preparing to reduce Black.]
;B[jp]C[Black defends.]
;W[ag]
;B[ah]C[Again, looking for sente endgame plays.]
;W[af]
;B[bi]
;W[bl]C[I play here once to reduce.]
;B[bk]
;W[jq]LB[bm:A]C[But then tenuki since I thought this was bigger and playing at A for Black would be gote.]
;B[kq]
;W[mr]C[Simple hane to expand my territory while keeping good shape and preventing Black from trying to test my life and death skills in the corner.]
;B[lr]
;W[ns]
;B[jr]
;W[ir]C[Block.]
;B[is]
;W[hs]C[It pained me to give Black a sente endgame sequence, but it could not be avoided.]
;B[js]
;W[hr]
;B[gh]TR[fi][fj]C[This move was painful for me since it meant I could either save the top of save my two stones.]
;W[gg]C[I decided the top was bigger and that I could possibly get sente out of this and hopefully get some compensation.]
;B[fh]
;W[eh]
;B[ei]
;W[hh]
;B[gi]
;W[fg]
;B[ej]C[I'm not sure this move was necessary by Black, but I was glad to get sente.]
;W[se]LB[rg:A]TR[re][rf]C[Threaten to cut at A and capture the marked stones.]
;B[rg]
;W[bm]LB[ls:A]C[Though this move is pretty big in terms of endgame. The hane at A is better since it's sente.]
;B[ls]C[Black takes it away from me.]
;W[so]C[since I don't see any more sente plays, I figure this is one of the bigger moves left.]
;B[sn]
;W[sp]
;B[ms]
;W[nr]C[Connect.]
;B[hp]
;W[gp]LB[fq:A]
;B[sf]
;W[sd]
;B[kf]
;W[jf]
;B[dm]
;W[pf]LB[of:A]C[Threaten to push at A.]
;B[of]
;W[ip]
;B[ho]
;W[ak]LB[hq:A]C[Though defending at A would save me a point, I believe that this sequence is worth more.]
;B[aj]
;W[al]
;B[hq]
;W[fr]C[With this being the last move, we counted and I won by 9.5 points! Woot!])
