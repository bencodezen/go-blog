;B[pd]BL[1793.971]
;W[jj]WL[1794.922]C[Since White responds with tengen, I decided that my strategy from this point on would be to try a more territorial strategy and see how to best negate the tengen later on.]
;B[cd]BL[1786.921]
;W[pp]WL[1793.73]
;B[dq]BL[1778.568]C[The reason I avoided the 4-4 after the tengen response is that the star point shines well with influence towards the center, but since White already has tengen, it is not nearly as effective.]
;W[qf]WL[1792.489]
;B[nc]BL[1774.799]C[I choose a calm response to prevent provoking any early battle that would allow White to utilize his tengen well.]
;W[co]WL[1786.37]
;B[cm]BL[1746.942]
;W[dp]WL[1777.752]C[This is considered a bad move by White since it will strengthen the corner but give him no points.]
;B[cq]BL[1669.379]LB[eq:A]C[This is the correct response. Option A would not punish the contact play properly since White would then play at C3 for good shape.]

;B[eo]BL[1647.73]
;W[fq]WL[1738.317]
;B[dn]BL[1599.279]TR[co][dp]C[I decided to stick with the solid connection and keep the triangled stones subdued.]
;W[jp]WL[1723.158]LB[ed:A][qh:B][qn:C][nq:D]C[At this point, I am considering the following areas: A, B, and C. For those who think that D is a good idea, it invites the kick which will only help White. See variation to see what I mean.]
(;B[qn]BL[1566.847]C[I decide that since White owes me a move for R14, it might be better to take a more proactive role and approach from this side.]
;W[pl]WL[1718.619]LB[on:A][qq:B]C[If you look at the board as a whole, you'll notice that White's influence is very strong in the lower right. As a result, any typical response such as A and B will only serve to help White solidify his influence which would be very difficult for Black to deal with later.]
;B[nq]BL[1536.163]C[So, for the first time (at least that I'm aware of), I purposely make the decision to switch directions and mix things up a bit!]

;B[ro]BL[1515.139]
;W[qm]WL[1690.578]TR[nq]C[This seems to be an error of strategy for White. The goal should be to solidify the wall and attack the marked black stone instead of trying to build thickness to build the right side. ]
;B[po]BL[1510.338]
;W[oo]WL[1686.449]
;B[pr]BL[1506.716]
;W[qo]WL[1683.023]C[I thought about this decision for awhile....]
;B[oq]BL[1455.75]C[And decided that the bottom was better to destroy and that the right side could be dealt with later on.]
;W[rn]WL[1678.186]
;B[ph]BL[1358.942]LB[of:B][qh:A]C[Now's the time to erase White's right side. Notice how I did not pincer on the third line at A. This is because a pincer on third line says "I want to live with this stone," and trying to live when white has all that thickness in the R7 area is suicidal.]
;W[rh]WL[1661.887]C[Odd response on White's part. I guess the goal is connect back... but why not just 3-3?]
;B[qd]BL[1317.291]C[Oh well, my territory now.]
;W[of]WL[1657.472]
;B[nh]BL[1313.817]C[I was worried at this point since my stone's were about to be surrounded and White was about to have a huge center influence that I would have a hard time dealing with.]
;W[mc]WL[1649.969]C[This was an odd move since it created another group for white, but I was happy that I wasn't being attacked anymore.]
;B[md]BL[1285.977]
;W[oc]WL[1644.263]C[Nice clamp that threatens to cut my stones apart if I try to go after the N17 stones.]
;B[od]BL[1265.29]
;W[nb]WL[1640.965]
;B[nd]BL[1263.436]C[No problem. I'll let him deal with his multiple cut points while I have a strong and resilient shape.]
;W[ob]WL[1630.922]
;B[lc]BL[1250.696]
;W[qb]WL[1620.324]C[Moment of truth. Should I try to kill?]
;B[mb]BL[1181.663]C[I resist the urge and decide that letting white live in the corner and having solid thickness is way better.]
;W[rc]WL[1616.586]
;B[mg]BL[1105.075]C[Although this seems slow, I wanted to ensure my groups were connected before trying to commit myself somewhere else.]

;B[gf]BL[935.309]
