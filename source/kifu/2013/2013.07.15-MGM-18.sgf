;W[dd]MN[1]
;B[cf]
;W[ci]LB[ch:A]C[When playing White, I have found that the best thing you can do is mix it up. Do not stick with moves that opponents are usually familiar with. An example would be the one space pincer at A. The sooner you get your opponent out of his/her comfort zone, the easier time you will have trying to balance the game back in your favor.]
;B[fc]
;W[ee]C[When in doubt, split your opponent in handicap games.]
;B[cc]
;W[cd]
;B[dc]
;W[fq]C[At this point, the joseki is not quite finished in the upper left, but it's time for White to move on and establish a position in different parts of the board.]
;B[ed]LB[fe:A]C[I can't let Black get superior shape at A.]
;W[fd]C[So I atari.]
;B[ec]
;W[cm]C[And then move on.]
;B[de]C[Black seems very occupied with punishing White's tenuki, but the important thing to remember in situation like these is that trying to save your stones will only help Black. Better to abandon and possible use the aji for later on.]
;W[eo]
;B[ef]LB[fe:A]C[In this case, Black's direction for atari is incorrect. Since Black's intention is to completely silence the upper left, the double atari at A would be better. In addition, let's not forget the fact that White can still use the stones later on for aji.]
;W[nq]
;B[kq]
;W[no]C[Keeping Black split...]
;B[pn]
;W[iq]C[Now attack!]
;B[mp]LB[np:A][pq:B]C[This peep was great on Black's part. If White connects at A, he gets a heavy group and Black would most likely respond with B which will solidify territory and force White to run. This would be a complete disaster for White if this occurs.]
;W[qq]C[So I decide to pick safety first.]
;B[np]C[Since I am feeling rather pressured from the top left power that Black is radiating, I decide to cash in.]
;W[cq]C[Now I will hopefully get a big chunk in the lower left. It is important to note though, that I had full confidence in living in the lower right, which is why I decided to cash in now.]
;B[qp]
;W[pq]
;B[oq]
;W[or]
;B[op]
;W[rp]
;B[ro]
;W[rq]
;B[cn]C[This move had the intention of hoping to get a cross cut and possibly escape/live, but consider the fact that the fight is already 4 to 2 with White's sente, better to leave it alone then strengthen White now.]
;W[dm]TR[ci][cm][dm]C[Now the connection between the marked stones has been strengthened as a result.]
;B[qi]LB[qe:4][qf:3][qg:2][qh:1][qj:1][qk:2][ql:3][qm:4]C[Black's move here seems to prevent a splitting move by White, but the problem is that it is inefficient. You'll notice that on both sides of the R11 stone are only 4 space extensions. In addition, Black's thick wall is too close to the R11 stone and not to mention R11 is on the third line which is not good for development.]
;W[qc]LB[pj:A]C[I think the 3-3 is questionable as white, a shoulder hit at A may have been a better possibiliy; but I think I wanted to take the corner and start a fight in the center.]
;B[qd]
;W[pc]LB[qe:1][qf:2][qg:3][qh:4]
;B[oc]
;W[ob]
;B[nc]
;W[nb]
;B[mc]
;W[rd]
;B[re]
;W[rc]
;B[qf]LB[qg:1][qh:2][pj:A]C[See how close Black's stone is to his wall? In actuality, Black would be much happier if his R11 stone were at A. Since it wasn't, that is one of the reasons I chose to just invade and secure territory in sente.]
;W[pj]LB[mj:D][qj:A][pk:B][ql:C]C[This is too deep for White to invade, but what White is hoping for is Black A, White, Black C (somewhere), and then White D.]
;B[nj]C[White was a little too optimistic though. And Black properly caps and attacks.]
;W[qm]C[Now White tries to poke at the holes in Black's shape. This move aims at possibility connecting back to the S4 group.]
;B[qn]C[Black correctly defends.]
;W[ni]
;B[oi]
;W[nk]C[One thing I have noticed is that the clamp is really good for switching directions and causing some confusion. Something to consider using in your own games.]
;B[oj]C[Black connects solidly though, and White is in tatters.... I'm in big trouble.]
;W[ok]
;B[pk]
;W[qk]C[I decide to go for the long shot and possibly create more aji.]
;B[pl]
;W[pm]
;B[ol]
;W[pi]
;B[ph]
;W[qj]
;B[qh]
;W[om]
;B[nl]
;W[mk]
;B[nm]
;W[nn]
;B[on]
;W[ql]TR[oi][nj][oj]C[Up until this point, I have been eyeing the possible ladder with the marked group, but the moment of truth comes down to Black's response here.]
;B[ll]LB[mm:A]C[Although this looks to be good shape, the correct move is actually at A.]
;W[lk]LB[oh:A][lm:B]C[White's extension here now makes miai of A and B.]
(;B[nh]C[So Black reads out the ladder correctly.]
;W[lm]C[But apparently forgot about this tesuji. xD]
;B[mn]
;W[mm]
;B[mo]
;W[ml]C[What a lucky break for White...]
;B[nr]
;W[ps]
;B[ii]LB[hj:A]C[Black now aims to reduce White lower left potential. White could try to cash in at A, but this will let Black grow his top area which is nothing to sneeze at.]
;W[lh]C[So, the best defense is to counterattack!]
;B[mh]
;W[li]
;B[lg]
;W[jh]
;B[jf]
;W[ih]
;B[jm]
;W[gh]
;B[hg]C[This peeps helps to solidify the top area for Black, but it is weakening his center stones.]
;W[hh]
;B[ip]
;W[hp]
;B[io]
;W[ho]
;B[hn]C[At this point, I'm feeling rather behind and not sure how to pull out of this situation since Black looks like he will either connect or live.]
;W[ko]C[So I throw a probing move to see what Black's intentions are.]
;B[kn]
;W[jp]LB[ln:A]C[I play here fully expecting to see Black connect at A and continue destroying what little framework I have left.]
;B[jo]C[But Black pushes here thinking that I will connect. Normally, this is not a bad idea since it gives Black nice shape, but White can throw those stones away easily.]
;W[in]C[This was probably unexpected for Black.]
;B[jn]
;W[im]
;B[jq]
;W[il]C[Now White has succeeded in walling off a rather big chunk of the lower left.]
;B[hq]
;W[gq]
;B[hr]
;W[gr]C[I'm still debating twhether this was worth playing. It might not actually be sente enough for Black's response.]
;B[ir]C[Luckily though, Black captures, so I get sente back.]
;W[lb]LB[eh:A]C[And here is the move that almost let's Black take back the game. I should have just played at A.]
;B[ei]C[Now Black jumps in, which was devastating, but there is a glimmer of hope since it is one line too deep.]
;W[eh]
;B[dh]
;W[di]
;B[fh]
;W[eg]
;B[fg]
;W[fi]
;B[ej]
;W[dg]
;B[cg]
;W[ch]LB[df:A]C[After this, I fully expected Black A which is completely sente.]
;B[gn]C[This was a good forcing move.]
;W[fo]
;B[gi]C[Another good forcing move.]
;W[fj]
;B[ji]C[And then Black gives White his salvation here.]
;W[ff]TR[cd][dd][fd][ee]C[I quickly seize the opportunity to break into Black's top and give myself a better fighting position. Also, note how the marked stones that Black spent a number of moves capturing is now actually coming back alive.]
;B[gg]
;W[df]
;B[kh]LB[kg:B][ki:A]TR[gh][hh][ih][jh]C[This was a good plan on Black's part. Either capture White's marked stones and put a dent into his framework, or break in another way. White to play. Is A or B better?]
(;W[ki]C[This is the guaranteed safe path.]
;B[kg]
;W[hi]
;B[gj]
;W[fk]
;B[hj]TR[gh][hh][ih][jh][hi]C[Now, White to play. Save the marked stones!]
;W[ij]
;B[jj]
;W[jk]
;B[ik]
;W[kj]C[Correct!]
;B[]LB[lc:3][ce:1][he:2]C[With the squeeze tesuji completed, Black resigns here due to the multiple weaknesses in his remaining territory.])
(;W[kg]
;B[ki]
;W[lf]
;B[mg]
;W[jg]LB[lj:A]TR[fg][gg][hg][fh]C[It's kind of tough to see how White will fight his way out of this, and Black has A in his aresenal to connect. He might get the marked stones in the process, but Black will also have connected and reduced the center.]))
