;W[dd]C[In handicap games, if I have the chance to occupy a corner, I always prefer the star point since it provides the most flexibility regarding fast development.]MN[1]
;B[pj]C[Sanrensei is a good choice by Black since it is an attacking formation.]
;W[nc]
;B[qf]LB[lc:B][pf:A]C[This response is inconsistent with the sanrensei. A or B is normal.]
;W[jd]
;B[fq]LB[cf:B][jp:A]C[Once again, this is inconsistent with the sanrensei and is rather passive. A or B would take a more active approach and make White's life more difficult.]
;W[nq]C[White plays here with the intention of switching directions if Black pincers.]
;B[pn]C[Here Black responds correctly.]
;W[jq]LB[lq:A]C[This is an overplay by White since it leaves the obvious invasion at A, but faster development + complications is White's key to victory.]
;B[cf]
;W[cj]C[As White, I playing anything but a pincer in response to the approach move is a mistake since Black is already spread out all over the board. This is the time to establish positions (even if they are not secure) in multiple parts of the board so that you have aji to exploit in the middlegame. ]
;B[cl]
;W[dg]
;B[cc]
;W[dc]
;B[cd]
;W[de]
;B[ce]
;W[df]C[In this sequence, White has given Black approximately 6 points of definite territory in return for power. The idea behind this is to utilize the power of the wall in order to make more territory than Black's territory.]
;B[cg]
;W[cn]
;B[bp]
;W[jj]C[A little lackluster, but it threatens a large framework where White actually wants Black to invade.]
;B[me]C[This is a good reduction move by Black, but it could potentially be one line too far.]
;W[oe]C[White decides to complicate matters with this cut.]
;B[od]
;W[nd]
;B[ne]
;W[of]
;B[nh]C[White is clearly in a bad position to here, so the best is to leave the position for now and try and utilize the aji later on.]

;W[mc]
;B[lb]
;W[mg]
;B[le]
;W[kd]
;B[nj]C[At this point, White cannot think about capturing the N15 stones since O17 would lose in the capturing race]
;W[qh]C[Now we further complicate things.]
;B[rj]
;W[pg]
;B[ng]C[Black decides to solidify the entire right corner for himself here.]
;W[nf]C[However, White has other plans....]
;B[mf]C[In handicap games, White's advantage comes in the long and difficult to read sequences such as this ladder. So my question to you: Does this ladder work out in Black's favor? Or White's?]
;W[ke]
;B[lf]
;W[lg]C[If your answer is Black, see variation.]
(;B[pb]
;W[ml]C[White does not want to give this group up too easily.]
;B[rh]
;W[qq]C[Since this 3-3 is still available to White, it's time to take it away from Black.]
;B[pq]
;W[pr]
;B[or]
;W[qr]
;B[oq]
;W[ro]
;B[ko]

;W[io]
;B[rn]
;W[qo]
;B[qn]
;W[qp]
;B[nm]
;W[nl]C[This is probalby White's first big mistake since he makes himself heavy.]
;B[jl]
;W[nr]TR[ml][nl][ol][ql]C[This tesuji is executed too early. White should be focused on escaping with this marked group.]

;W[ri]
;B[on]TR[ml][nl][ol][ql]C[This move was unexpected for White since he expected Black to protect the upper right area. White's marked group is now in a lot of trouble.]
;W[ob]C[This may seem small, but it aims at exploiting corner aji later on.]
;B[pf]
;W[og]
;B[qg]
;W[ph]
;B[ji]C[This is a great attachment by Black. Functions as a ladder breaker and puts a dent in White's framework.]
;W[kf]
;B[kj]
;W[gl]
;B[hk]
;W[ij]C[I choose to sacrifice the G8 stone in hopes of solidifying my center in sente.]

;W[fk]
;B[fl]
;W[ki]
;B[li]
;W[kh]
;B[kk]LB[hi:A]C[There are potential problems in the A area, but I feel that I am still behind and need to try and be more proactive before fixing it.]

;B[hi]C[Black correctly reads out this sequence.]
;W[hj]
;B[gj]
;W[gi]LB[ik:A]C[White cannot really cut, but is hoping to try and create complications by pushing through at A. It's a rather wreckless concept, but Whtie is kind of in trouble here.]
;B[ik]C[Luckily for White, Black chooses to simply seal of the center (which is still big and probably the better move overall).]
;W[ii]C[Because White has to fix his center in gote.]
;B[fi]
;W[gh]
;B[ei]C[And Black still gets this...]
;W[rg]C[At this point, I know that I'm behind, and decide to try and take sente to gain back some momentum.]

;W[ls]LB[di:B][ms:A]C[Here is my game losing move. I anticipated Black would connect at A which give my group life in sente and would then allow me to fix the area in the upper left by playing B.]
;B[dh]C[This move was devastating. Major props to Black for not responding to White. At this point, White has almost not chance of coming back unless Black makes a big mistake.]
;W[cq]C[White tries to create some complications here...]
;B[cp]C[But Black responds correctly.]

;W[gp]
;B[go]
;W[ho]
;B[fo]
;W[ms]C[Here is White's final shot at winning. If Black plays ignores...]
(;B[mo]C[Black correctly connects, and all hope is pretty much lost for White.]
;W[cb]LB[db:A]C[Although this reduces Black's territory a bit, this is in gote, so in actuality, the descent at A would be better since it allows for the endgame sequence at C19 is Black responds.]
