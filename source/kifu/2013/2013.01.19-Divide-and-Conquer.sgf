;W[dp]WL[1784.734]
;B[fq]BL[1749.47]C[I thought this was an interesting approach since I was half expecting the Chinese opening. I didn't want black to give Black an easy moyo game, so aggression starts now!]

;W[po]WL[1676.195]C[Debated which approach to do, but since Black only needed one move to enclose the corner here, I chose to approach here instead.]
;B[mq]BL[1533.924]C[First time I've had this response.]
;W[np]WL[1654.157]C[This helps to press Black down.]
;B[nq]BL[1515.04]
;W[qq]WL[1647.193]C[Helps to establish a base or at least some thickness if Black resists.]
;B[mp]BL[1490.623]
;W[no]WL[1630.346]
;B[jq]BL[1486.403]C[I was happy to see Black play here since the stone inefficiently placed.]
;W[iq]WL[1579.223]C[I was pretty proud of this move. #1. It cuts off any connection between F3 and K3. #2. Strengthens my group by leaning on an already strong group.]
;B[jp]BL[1461.93]
;W[ho]WL[1563.809]
;B[qj]BL[1456.678]C[I was sad to see Black take a strategic position I was eyeing....]
;W[qm]WL[1508.662]C[It was either here or A, and I decided here since it was one space further away from R10 and had less aji. At this point, I'm fully aware of my strategy: Carve black up into small chunks = Make all my groups live.]
;B[oj]BL[1415.269]C[I was hoping this move wouldn't be induced by the R7 move, but alas he did play it, so now it was a matter of how to get in there.]
;W[nc]WL[1466.76]LB[re:C][pf:A][qf:B]C[At the time, I was considering A and B as well, but I figured those would come under attack immediately and I'd gain nothing but a weak group while Black made profit. C might be worth considering as well.]
;B[kc]BL[1358.53]
;W[qc]WL[1387.665]TR[oj][qj]C[I decide to make another living group, although it did pain me to think that Black would get a wall that would have an ideal five space extension to the triangled stones.]

;W[md]WL[1281.919]C[In my mind at the time, I thought I would start a fight so that Black wouldn't get a big piece of territory.]

;W[ld]WL[1276.347]
;B[kd]BL[1270.453]
;W[ke]WL[1274.338]C[CUT!]
;B[gc]BL[1098.389]C[This move surprised me. I expected an atari and then a running battle, but my opponent was trying to avoid that as best he could.]
;W[je]WL[1253.266]C[Strengthen my group...]
;B[id]BL[1089.288]
;W[dj]WL[1181.617]SQ[oe][pe][qe][of][pf][qf][og][pg][qg][oh][ph][qh][oi][pi][qi]C[So this may seem like a weird tenuki, but my rationale was that my triangled group wasn't going to be capture anytime soon, so time to take a big point on the board in case I cannot reduce the squared area later on.]

;B[ie]BL[960.656]
;W[mh]WL[1051.747]TR[lf][mg][nh][oi]C[Once again, I didn't see my group getting captured easily, so I didn't want to strengthen my opponent without real cause. Hence the reduction move. (Notice I play on the border of the territory and not any further in since I will get attacked and most likely die.)]
;B[mj]BL[921.743]
;W[kh]WL[1040.294]C[See how I'm reinforcing my group now? Much better than running randomly and letting your opponent attack you for free.]
;B[ih]BL[914.154]
;W[ne]WL[997.139]LB[nf:A]C[I thought this was rather clever, but I think Black A would render this move useless.]

;W[ik]WL[398.206]
;B[bj]BL[320.197]
;W[cl]WL[394.672]LB[el:A]C[This was overplay on my part I thought I could cut at A in sente, but after a bit more reading, I realized it doesnt work.]
;B[ck]BL[282.109]
;W[dk]WL[382.864]
;B[dl]BL[275.516]C[So most players would leave the position as is wright now. but I wanted to fix by connection and shapes with a sente sequence.]

;B[el]BL[257.762]LB[di:B][fk:A]TR[ch][bi][ci]C[Except I forget that the push at A makes the atari at B possible which will cost White the entire triangled group and could mean the difference between winning and losing this game.]
