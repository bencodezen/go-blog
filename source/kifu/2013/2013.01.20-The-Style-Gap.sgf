;B[pj]C[Not sure how to respond so I try a double pincer. I don't think this was very good since the move doesn't quite put real pressure on either group.]
;W[nc]
;B[nd]C[I decide on the attach move to gain some strength.]

;B[pf]C[this move was probably bad in retrospect. Maybe the kick would be better?]

;W[re]
;B[cd]C[I thought this would be good, but I forgot that White's approach works well with this potential thickness at N16.]

;W[ld]
;B[jf]LB[me:A]C[They say that the atari is a bad move. I think this is an example of that. A would've been far simpler and ensure my group was much stronger.]
