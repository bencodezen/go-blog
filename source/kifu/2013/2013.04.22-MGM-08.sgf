;W[ck]WL[281.952]C[Mirror Chinese Opening!]
;B[gq]BL[269.925]TR[dq][pq]C[This is the correct direction for Black since both player's 3-4 moves are facing the bottom for potential growth.]
;W[do]WL[266.075]C[This is a calm response to Black's approach.]
;B[jp]BL[268.314]LB[jq:A]C[Black's response here seems to signify that he would like to develop the bottom. If he had played on the third line at A instead, although it is safer, it would be difficult for him to grow the bottom later on.]
;W[nc]WL[261.465]C[White now takes initiative on the top.]
;B[pf]BL[266.421]C[Black's response here is good since it allows potential development on the right side. The third line would be a little passive and restrict growth later on.]
;W[pb]WL[259.384]
;B[qc]BL[256.737]
;W[kc]WL[252.654]C[Normal settling sequence.]
;B[po]BL[250.765]C[Withe Black's sente, he chooses to enclose the corner and threaten a very poserful framework. I know that many kyu players, myself included, would be panicking as White at this point since Black has a corner encloser with double winged extensions.]
;W[qq]WL[246.936]C[This boggled my mind. What on earth is White doing?]
;B[qp]BL[245.613]C[At this point, many of us would try and struggle to live.]
;W[oq]WL[240.731]C[The clamp is a simple but ingenius move.]
;B[pr]BL[244.078]C[Black must cut off the group.]
;W[op]WL[227.097]
;B[pp]BL[242.407]
;W[lp]WL[223.889]C[White is now settled. And for those wondering what the point of R3 was, it was played with the intention of settling on the other side. And if you're thinking, Black got a corner though, it was already his to begin with since he played the corner enclosure.]

;B[ci]BL[102.238]C[White gets a corner, and Black has broken into the left side. Feels like White got a better exchange though since the top is starting to turn into territory as well.]
;W[cg]WL[186.332]C[This seems like an asking move.]
;B[ch]BL[97.86]
