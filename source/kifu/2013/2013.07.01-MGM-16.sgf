;B[pd]BL[2689.834]
;W[dd]WL[2688.916]
;B[pq]BL[2679.521]C[As per usual, I start a potential Chinese fuseki.]
;W[cp]WL[2641.731]C[This is an interesting choice by White since it gives Black a chance to approach on the strong side of his 3-4. Normally I've seen White play ninrensei against Chinese.]
;B[ep]BL[2662.73]
;W[eq]WL[2620.745]
;B[fq]BL[2660.721]
;W[dq]WL[2613.517]
;B[qk]BL[2639.527]LB[fp:A]C[I had been experimenting with using approach move as probes more often. Although in this instance, it seems that most stronger players agree that the cut at A is a little severe to leave behind.]
;W[mp]WL[2568.582]C[White's approach here simplified Black's decision due to the incomplete sequence on the lower left.]
;B[jp]BL[2629.449]C[I honestly believe this is the only move.]
;W[oo]WL[2560.594]
;B[qo]BL[2582.705]
;W[nm]WL[2423.937]
;B[fp]BL[2573.342]C[Now Black has started solidifying the corner and has also achieved ideal shape in the lower left while White is semi-floating.]
;W[nc]WL[2338.337]
;B[pf]BL[2465.311]
;W[pb]WL[2322.099]
;B[qc]BL[2461.668]
;W[kc]WL[2316.617]LB[cn:A]C[As some of you know, White is supposed to have a move at A. With sente, I decided to capitalize on the mising move.]
;B[co]BL[2455.797]
;W[bo]WL[2302.8]
;B[dp]BL[2444.254]
;W[cq]WL[2289.342]
;B[cf]BL[2409.108]LB[cn:A]C[This is a bad tenuki. I thought I was trying to think on a broad scale, but every player who reviewed this game said that I absolutely needed to continue at A.]
;W[cn]WL[2265.438]C[White promptly takes advantage of my mistake.]
;B[cj]BL[2387.098]C[So I take the opportunity to get a nice extension.]
;W[ch]WL[2246.107]C[This invasion here is a little premature due to Black still having access to the corner. In addition, see variation for how Black should properly respond.]
(;B[cc]BL[2371.105]C[This lets White off a little too easily.]
;W[cd]WL[2168.952]

;B[fc]BL[2357.1]
;W[di]WL[2159.585]TR[nm][oo][mp]C[As of this point, I'm looking at the board and feel like the marked White group could be a target. ]
;B[ld]BL[2250.494]C[So I begin a leaning attack here.]
;W[lc]WL[2142.481]
;B[nd]BL[2248.374]
;W[md]WL[2121.44]
;B[me]BL[2246.313]
;W[mc]WL[2120.587]LB[le:A][ne:B]C[At this point, many kyu players are probably tempted to fix one of the cuts, but this will give White sente to do as he pleases. Remember, those moves are forcing moves to gain some strength. That is all.]
;B[nk]BL[2226.118]C[This move is two fold: (1) Attack the White group. (2) Build the right side.]
;W[ok]WL[2051.711]
;B[oj]BL[2207.558]
;W[nj]WL[1983.497]
;B[ol]BL[2190.454]
;W[oi]WL[1972.324]
;B[pj]BL[2182.191]
;W[mi]WL[1955.37]LB[mk:A]C[White should have atari'd at A first instead. ]
;B[nh]BL[2158.361]LB[mk:A]C[I am too trigger happy here and think this is sente. In reality, White can ignore this and go ahead and play at A.]
;W[ni]WL[1950.261]C[I'm lucky that he responds.]
;B[mk]BL[2153.146]C[And then I take the critical point.]
;W[oq]WL[1938.151]
;B[pp]BL[2140.437]C[My goal with this move is to maintain solid shape so that I could attack/kill the group.]
;W[hp]WL[1931.141]C[I debate how to handle this invasion.]
;B[hq]BL[2117.007]C[And decide to simply connect.]
;W[iq]WL[1924.638]
;B[ip]BL[2112.399]

;B[jn]BL[2032.919]
;W[er]WL[1875.548]
;B[gn]BL[2007.68]TR[gp][hp][gq]C[I decide here to try and capture the marked stones.]

;W[in]WL[1799.305]

;W[jm]WL[1776.475]
;B[kn]BL[1931.112]
;W[fr]WL[1762.39]C[When White cuts here, I am still feeling secure about my position on the left.]
;B[jq]BL[1896.507]C[So I go ahead and firmly capture this stone.]
;W[fo]WL[1739.257]C[Without thinking, I assume I am connected.]
;B[eo]BL[1879.875]
;W[en]WL[1735.581]C[Oh wait.... White can do that? xD Stupid squeeze tesuji. Haha.]
(;B[km]BL[1819.006]C[I actually nearly resign, but decide that the game is not quite over.]
;W[or]WL[1614.784]
;B[mr]BL[1801.525]C[Take away White's shape point.]
;W[qn]WL[1609.174]
;B[rn]BL[1777.835]
;W[rm]WL[1571.316]
;B[pn]BL[1722.104]C[I was careful about this atari (since it normally helps your opponent), but my reading told me I would be okay.]

;B[pm]BL[1686.198]

;W[lf]WL[771.455]TR[lf][mf]C[And here I make a big mistake and have classic "Kyu Tunnel Syndrome" and focus on capturing the marked stones.]
;B[kf]BL[1082.966]LB[li:A]C[The correct move is actually at A.]
;W[li]WL[753.556]C[Once White plays here, I hang my head in shame/]

;W[lj]WL[669.672]
;B[mm]BL[873.282]C[At this point, I'm not sure if White can magically make life through aji in the center stones, so I decide to defend solidly.]
;W[hh]WL[576.267]C[The only problem is that White's left side is MONSTROUS.]
;B[jl]BL[844.967]
;W[il]WL[563.049]
;B[ik]BL[802.716]C[So I embark to establish a group inside White's sphere of influence.]
