;W[dd]MN[1]
;B[qq]C[For those who are still unfamiliar with purpose of moves, the 3-3 here signifies that Black wants the corner and not interested in influence/fighting. While safe, this is contrary to Black's need to pursue a strong attacking position for later on in the game.]
;W[cn]LB[nc:A][qf:C][pp:D][fq:B]C[This approach move (or A) seems to be the better direction (as opposed to B, C, or D) since it has potential to synergize with the D16 stone. For those wondering why D is too early, it is because White is not sure which direction is more important yet. Better to save it for later.]
;B[dk]LB[dl:A]C[This is the right idea for Black. Taking the initiative and attacking White. A one space closer pincer would be more severe though, but do keep in mind that it could start a fight.]
;W[fq]LB[cq:A]C[Here is a common tactic to complicate the game. Simply diving into may gain White some territory, but it'll give Black a lot of power for later on.]
;B[dn]
;W[dm]C[This is meant to start a fight complicate matters.]
;B[en]
;W[cq]TR[dm][cn]C[Since Black played solid, I decided to treat those stones lightly and establish a position in the corner while leaving the marked stones as potential aji for later.]
;B[co]
;W[dq]
;B[em]TR[dm][cn]C[This move, while seeming like it silences the marked stones, only provides some influence and allows White to tenuki and gain initiative on a different part of the board.]
;W[nc]
;B[cf]
;W[ch]TR[dm][cn]C[This is an overplay by White, but the purpose is to possibly utilize the marked stones in the potential fight.]
;B[ef]LB[fd:A]C[Joseki would have White play here, but joseki has no place for White in handicap games. Everything is situational.]
;W[eh]C[Thus, my goal is to further create confusion.]
;B[fd]LB[cc:A][fd:3][cf:1][ef:2]C[Notice that Black has chosen to cut off the corner. White could try to make life by palying A, but you'll notice it's a 3 v. 1 fight and even though White will probably live, the power that Black will gain will be very difficult to fight against.]
;W[pp]C[Time to ask Black what he would prefer to have, the left or right?]
;B[qp]
;W[po]
;B[or]LB[qm:B][nq:A]C[Which direction A or B?]
;W[qo]LB[kq:A]TR[fq]C[The reason why I chose B is that the A area is not very interesting to develop. White's marked group are already in position to limit Black's growth, so it makes more sense for White to Block the other side.]
;B[qk]C[Black's takes a important point for White.]
;W[qi]TR[po][qo]C[White counterattacks to try and utilize the small amount of thickness he has.]
;B[pf]
;W[oj]C[Continue the attack.]
;B[oc]LB[jc:B][nd:A]C[White's kick is good, but White cannot afford to play at A since Black will DEFINNITELY play at B in response.]
;W[jc]C[White must overplay and take the important strategiec point.]
;B[nd]
;W[mc]C[White to gain some stability.]
;B[cc]C[Black firmly captures the marked corner. This is a pretty large chunk of territory. White must try and figure out how to catch up.]
;W[gc]C[This move is played as a forcing move to make Black defend his corner and make his stones overconcentrated while continuing to further stability White's position.]
;B[fc]
;W[ck]C[When you want to complicate things in a handicap games, I find that attaching to a strong group is always a useful technique.]
;B[cl]C[Black wants to ensure the marked stones are really dead, but this is what White wants since Black is only making a few points white White is establishing a better position.]
;W[cj]
;B[bl]C[Black's descent is good here since it undermines White's base.]
;W[ek]C[I chose the clamp here since I thought it would give me some thickness to ensure my left group didn't die.]
;B[dj]
;W[di]
;B[ej]
;W[bo]C[Activate aji!]
;B[bn]
;W[cp]
;B[cm]C[Now White has protected his corner in sente while Black still has the same territry as before.]
;W[mp]C[White is hoping to try and compensate for the corner by growing his right side more.]
;B[qh]C[Nice move by Black to continue expanding his corner while threatening to connect to the R9 stone.]
;W[qj]
;B[kq]
;W[iq]C[This move gains White a few points while threatening to cut Black off and create a weak group for White to attack.]
;B[mq]
;W[lp]C[Take away Black's shape.]
;B[jp]
;W[pr]C[This move threatens to cut off the corner....]
;B[pq]
;W[oq]C[But it's true goal....]
;B[nr]
;W[rp]
;B[rq]C[is to seal off the right side in sente.]
;W[qg]C[Now White can go back and try and reduce Black's corner.]
;B[qf]
;W[ph]
;B[nl]
;W[ll]C[If Black's invasion here lives, White will not have enough points to win the game, so White must cappture this group.]
;B[ok]
;W[nj]C[When trying to kill a group, play as solid as you possibly can.]
;B[no]
;W[nq]
;B[ml]
;W[lm]
;B[mk]TR[nj][mk][ll]C[When you see the elephant's eye...]

;W[sm]C[Here I read out a sequence to kill the group, but...]
;B[sn]C[I forget that he can connect and win the semeai by one move.]
;W[sq]C[So I threaten here hoping he'd respond.]
;B[sl]C[But he chooses to make life.]
;W[rr]C[So I take the corner as compensation but am feeling rather behind since Black's group lived.]
;B[io]
;W[re]C[To have a chance at winning, I need to try and penetrate this corner.]

;B[bg]C[Here Black chooses to be aggressive, but this is a mistake.]
;W[cg]
;B[be]
;W[df]C[Because....]
;B[ce]

;B[ji]
;W[ki]
;B[hj]C[Now that Black's connected, White needs to make absolute sure that he will live.]
;W[dg]
;B[im]C[From this point on, White must elevate his endgame to the highest level to keep the balance of territory in his favor. The slightest mistake will allow Black to reverse the game.]
;W[cd]C[So when it comes to endgame, the best friend you  can have is sente moves!]
;B[bd]
;W[jr]
;B[gp]
;W[gq]
;B[fp]
;W[ep]C[This is slow and naive of me to think that Black will connect at D5.]
;B[hp]C[In the endgame, you must always make decisions as to whether or not it is worth it to tenuki.]
;W[og]LB[hq:A]C[I figured this was move was move sente than the push at A.]
