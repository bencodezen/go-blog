;B[ph]C[Attacking while making profit.]
;W[jg]LB[jd:A]C["A" stone starting to feel weak.]
;B[he]C[Attempt to split while gaining strength.]
;W[dc]
;B[hg]LB[cc:A]C[Here I'm too worried about continuing the splitting attack and strengthening my groups. A response at A would be much better and bigger.]
;W[ed]
;B[de]
;W[cc]C[Now White has an easy base and has undercut Black's upper left side.]
;B[fc]C[This was an attempt to fight back.]

;B[gf]C[This was an exchange for a wall, but White gets super stable group. Myung said that this was okay though.]
;W[cn]
;B[fp]LB[co:A]C[I was worried that constantly was too predictable, but this is passive and the kick at A should definitely be used.]
;W[dk]
;B[ck]
;W[cl]
;B[dl]LB[cj:A]C[There is a saying that atari is almost always a bad move. I thought I could make some exchange, but Myung said that connecting solidly at A is good enough since White is still under attack. This gives White a chance to easily establish a safe group.]

;W[cj]LB[ek:A]TR[dd][de][ee][ff][gf][dg][hg]C[See? Utter failure. Not only is White stable, but his group isn't even sealed in (as evident by the tail poking out at A). Now Black's triangled wall is inefficient since it will not be able to make any territory or attack properly anymore.]
;B[nf]C[This move was to cut White apart, but Myung reminded me that this is the type of direct attack that will rarely work. It is better to attack the group as a whole and gain profit.]

;B[lf]
;W[pe]
;B[qf]
;W[qe]C[Now White practically owns the corner. Haha.]
;B[pm]C[Trying to think big picture here.]
;W[mp]
;B[mn]LB[oq:A]C[This is rather loose if I remember correctly. Better to just attack at A and start to convert the corner/right side into solid territory.]

;B[nj]LB[pg:A]C[This is an attempt to split again, but I should just connect at A. After all, White is buried in a sea of black stones, I should have more confidence in my ability to prevent White from living.]

;B[ej]
;W[co]
;B[cp]
;W[do]C[So even though I'm ahead on points right now, the fact that the group lived broke my fighting spirit. So stupid right? I should've just estimated territory!!! Hahaha. Nonetheless, that doesn't change the fact that I resigned. =D])
