(;W[dc]WL[1782.377]LB[cd:A]C[For those who aren't strong at fuseki yet, this komoku is better than A because the strong side faces the opponent's stone and does not allow Black an easy approach that will let him utilize the star stone. See variation at Move 1.]
;B[pp]BL[1776.911]
;W[dq]WL[1773.548]C[Same concept. Strong side facing Black's star stone.]
;B[do]BL[1730.419]
;W[dl]WL[1750.619]LB[dc:A]TR[dd]C[I pincered here because I have a stone on the upper left, but in reality I don't think the pincer is as effective because the A stone does not have good potential to build the left hand side. If the A stone were at the marked star point instead, the pincer would perhaps be more powerful.]

;W[er]WL[1724.828]
;B[cm]BL[1688.43]
;W[cl]WL[1716.238]TR[ch]C[According to Eidogo, this is joseki, although I'm a little wary of whether this result is even since White is ending in gote and is lacking the extension to make the two stone wall effective.]
;B[de]BL[1658.3]C[Fortunately for me, Black's approach makes it easy to make the previous sequence work in my favor.]
;W[dg]WL[1669.681]TR[cl][dl]C[Although a two space pincer would have coincided with a perfect three space extension from the marked wall, I felt that the one space pincer would stir a fight that would allow me to end with a three space extension from my wall.]
;B[ec]BL[1620.936]C[This is apparently a wrong move for Black according to Eidogo. It seems it may be due to the fact that Black is trying to get influence on the top when in fact he will not really be able to secure solid influence while White will get a solid corner.]
;W[dd]WL[1646.595]C[This is the move to punish Black's outside attachment.]
;B[ed]BL[1619.496]LB[ee:A]C[The cut at A would aim to try and wrestle the top from Black, but I wanted to keep it simple.]
;W[ce]WL[1611.213]
;B[jc]BL[1583.292]LB[ee:B][cf:A]C[While this looks big, it is premature. Black should have followed up at A or B.]
;W[ee]WL[1574.555]C[Although I'm only a SDK, I think most dan players would agree that this cut/capture is huge in terms of the game development. Not only does it stabilize White's group, but now the left side is looking more solid and Black's top can be easily reduced.]
;B[db]BL[1568.551]C[Although blocking the corner may seem big...]
;W[fe]WL[1501.24]C[I felt this was more urgent and reduced Black while building power to secure the left.]

;W[qf]WL[1457.61]
;B[nc]BL[1484.988]LB[gc:1][jc:2][nc:3][nd:A]C[Although this move looks secure, A is better due to the fact that too many Black stones are already on the 3rd line. Making it difficult to build the top side.]
;W[rd]WL[1434.479]
;B[qc]BL[1482.48]
;W[qi]WL[1424.989]C[So I was happy to give black a settled low position in return for a settled group on the right.]
;B[jp]BL[1445.629]

;B[ck]BL[989.688]
;W[bl]WL[834.181]C[I realize I've lost the fight, but I extend once more for potential aji later on.]
;B[bk]BL[983.156]C[Utter tragedy. White's left side is now completely undercut and he has a solid piece of territory on the left now. Disaster for White.]
;W[je]WL[758.141]C[I decide it's time to try and build some power and hopefully reconcile the center, although this is a rather risky plan since Black has many ways into the center.]
;B[ql]BL[871.97]
;W[qq]WL[745.1]LB[np:A]C[I decide to invade at this point for sente which would allow me to then reduce his territory, but it is important to note that A can be considered as well.]
(;B[qp]BL[865.549]LB[pq:A]C[Black blocks on the wrong side. As the saying goes, block the wider side (which should be at A). See variation.]

]
;B[of]BL[794.453]C[This move was unexpected, but didn't seem to be a real threat.]
;W[lb]WL[586.793]C[So I decided to destroy top territory.]

;W[ll]WL[457.914]C[I decided to invade instead of reduce. My thought at this point was to complicate things and try to start a fight in order to recover from my defeat on the left side.]
;B[il]BL[700.433]
