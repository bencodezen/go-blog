;B[pd]BL[2689.437]
;W[dc]WL[2691.327]C[Komoku (3-4) with the strong side facing the star stone. This makes the approach move for Black harder since it will not easily synergize with the Q16 stone.]
;B[pq]BL[2673.767]LB[pk:B][qk:A]C[When Black plays here, one must always consider the possibility of the Chinese Opening at A or B (though more commonly A). ]
;W[cp]WL[2673.985]LB[pk:C][qk:D][eq:A][fq:B]C[Though this komoku exposes the weak side to the lower right komoku's strong side, this is done intentionally because White intends on playing a simple enclosure to counter the Chinese Opening if Black completes it at C or D.]
;B[ep]BL[2662.366]LB[eq:A]C[When Black approaches here, many players might play out the attachment joseki at A. The idea being White would get a solid corner and then get sente to approach the lower right. If you see the variation however, I personally feel that it is better for Black.]
(;W[po]WL[2657.908]C[Since I didn't really know what I wanted to do with the lower left yet, I decided to approach here and see what Black's intentions were.]
;B[qo]BL[2645.108]LB[pp:A]C[When Black attached here, I thought about playing out the joseki variation at A, but for some reason decided against it. Perhaps this is due to not wanting to get into a fight too early, but I think that the alternate variation might have been more dynamic for White.]
;W[qn]WL[2653.626]
;B[qp]BL[2643.532]
;W[pn]WL[2650.136]
;B[qj]BL[2615.494]LB[nq:A]C[This approach by Black is a little loose and fails to really attack the White group. The normal and proper move is at A since it gives Black a nice corner along with sente. Though Black may have removed White's extension, White has a very solid follow up.]
;W[oq]WL[2633.306]C[This attachment is quite severe.]
;B[pp]BL[2592.644]LB[oo:A][or:B]C[Black wants to threaten to cut White, but the ladder at A is in White's favor and this makes poor shape for Black. The normal move is at B.]
;W[op]WL[2630.939]C[White is happy to solidify his thickness and seal Black in.]
;B[rn]BL[2587.931]LB[or:A]C[This is a good move for making life, but I believe the hane at A would be better since is protect the corner while creating cutting points for Black to exploit later on.]
;W[or]WL[2585.881]C[I decide then to take the shape point.]
;B[pr]BL[2572.374]C[This block is good for Black in that it solidifes the corner, but it gives White sente to really use his wall to the fullest potential possible.]
;W[hp]WL[2568.441]C[So I naturally choose the pincer to start building the bottom.]
;B[co]BL[2552.032]C[This is a little unusual, but not wrong. Based on my understanding, this is asking to start a fight.]
;W[do]WL[2499.326]C[Since I'm strong on the right, I'm happy to oblige.]
;B[dp]BL[2546.342]
;W[cn]WL[2486.745]LB[dn:A]C[While atari is usually a "bad move," it is important in this situation since is breaks the ladder at A.]
;B[cq]BL[2512.893]LB[bo:A]C[Black is normally supposed to extend at A to keep White split and create complicated.]
;W[bo]WL[2470.759]C[With this ponnuki, White is now VERY solid and Black is sill left with a weak group. In combination with White's thickness on the right, this is not looking good for Black.]
;B[fo]BL[2495.242]LB[bq:A]C[Black tries to prevent White from sealing him in, but I think a move ilke A might be better for securing a base and not getting chased.]
;W[bq]WL[2450.772]C[I decide to go ahead and take away Black's base here while securing my group.]
;B[dq]BL[2484.677]LB[em:A][hn:B]TR[cq]C[This is small. Black should not worry about the marked stone. Not only does this make bad shape, but now Black is very heavy and White's attacks will be very severe for him. But now it's White's turn, and the question I pose to you is, from which direction should you attack?]
;W[hn]WL[2436.421]C[This move builds the bottom while attacking the Black stones. It aims to chase Black out and let White build naturally on the left. I won't say that this is the best move, but I feel that it is at least rationally sound.]
;B[fm]BL[2475.444]C[Black naturally jumps.]
;W[dl]WL[2429.46]LB[hl:A]C[And White keeps the pressure while naturally building the left side. Please note that if White jumps at A instead, Black will most likely dive into the left side which will hurt White's left potential. In addition, keep in mind that the bottom is still open to invasion and reduction, while it would be harder to do so for the left side.]
;B[el]BL[2466.534]LB[fk:A]C[This contact play is an attempt to make some eye shape, but I feel that Black should run once more before trying to make sabaki.]
;W[dk]WL[2425.948]C[White is happy to just simply extend and start making fourth line territory (aka the line of victory).]
;B[hl]BL[2461.083]C[Black makes shape and is now out in the center. There are no real severe moves to attack or pressure Black, so it's important to take sente and play somewhere else now.]
;W[nc]WL[2405.342]C[The top is the biggest area remaining.]
;B[nd]BL[2448.33]C[This attachment is a nice idea since it aims to build the right side.]
;W[md]WL[2400.355]C[I obligingly follow since I'm not too concerned if Black gets the upper right side.]
;B[oc]BL[2445.038]
;W[ne]WL[2398.138]
;B[od]BL[2442.67]LB[mc:A][me:B]C[Now a question to you: Which cutting point to protect? A or B?]
;W[me]WL[2364.978]LB[mc:A][jd:1][ji:2][oi:3]C[For those who chose A, realize that even thought it helps to "develop/protect" the top, there is still too much space for it to be really even called White's at the moment. This connection is much more oriented whole board thinking since it radiates out influence in three different directions. In addition, now Black's right side already is limited in its potential.]
;B[qg]BL[2421.088]LB[pg:A]C[Black plays here to try and protect the right, but a move at A would be more dynamic and gives Black a better chance to grow the right side. However, from the whole board perspective, this move is too slow since Black is behind.]
;W[de]WL[2324.493]C[Wtih sente, I decide the that the high corner enclosure would be powerful since it gives me the option of growing either the top or the left if I wanted to. If I enclosed on the third line, the left side would not have as much potential.]
;B[fe]BL[2404.527]C[Black realizes the issue at hand, and chooses to finally try and reduce.]
;W[eg]WL[2315.764]LB[he:A]C[This is a little odd shape wise. The idea was obviously to attack Black, but perhaps a move like A would have been better.]
;B[fg]BL[2397.376]C[When Black attaches, I'm happy to fix my shape.]
;W[eh]WL[2310.676]C[Solid connection starts to gain me 5th line territory now.]
;B[fh]BL[2378.383]C[This is pushing from behind. It is okay in certain circumstances, but White is on the fifth line and Black still does not really have eye shape yet.]
;W[ei]WL[2290.855]LB[cd:C][ef:B][fi:A][ej:D]C[I decide not to hane because at A since my position is a little thin around the B, C and D areas. So instead, I extended to further solidify my position while taking solid points.]
;B[lc]BL[2360.678]LB[mc:A]C[Then Black peeps here. In reality though, Black should have just cut at A. However, I think his intention is to make me heavy and attack my group.]
;W[mc]WL[2272.398]C[I decide to go ahead and connect becuase I believe Black is too thin around the board to launch a successful attack. And by connecting, there is a possibility the top could still be converted to White's territory.]
;B[fc]BL[2356.783]
;W[lb]WL[2227.483]C[I couldn't find a good move to jump out on, so I thought to make a little base and eye shape for myself with this hane.]
;B[kc]BL[2344.291]
;W[ob]WL[2223.691]LB[nb:A]C[I play here to remove the hane at A.]
;B[pb]BL[2341.267]
;W[kb]WL[2209.768]C[Then I decide to expand my eye space a bit.]
;B[jc]BL[2337.293]C[At this point, I have at least one eye, so I think to try something a little different.]
;W[hc]WL[2197.186]LB[fb:A][jb:B]C[This invasion threatesns a connection (or at least aji) at A or B.]
;B[hd]BL[2324.372]
;W[hb]WL[2192.008]C[This descent was to keep things simple.]
;B[je]BL[2288.969]C[Nice shape move by Black here.]
;W[jb]WL[2160.025]C[I decide to solidify my connection here and give my group more opportunity to eye space if I need it.]
;B[ic]BL[2275.953]LB[ib:A]C[When Black pushes here, I decide that I shoul not try to live on the first line any more than I already have, so I decide to make use of my ability to play in the center before I'm sealed off.]
;W[pi]WL[2128.446]C[So I choose the shoulder hit to see what Black has in mind.]
;B[qi]BL[2257.309]C[Simple connection.]
;W[pg]WL[2126.43]C[Normal sequence.]
;B[ph]BL[2249.91]C[Threaten to cut.]
;W[oh]WL[2124.913]C[Block while threatening to capture the cutting stone.]
;B[qh]BL[2247.793]
;W[pf]WL[2123.107]TR[pg]C[The marked stone is more important than the Q11 stone, which is why I extended here while flattening Black's right side.]
;B[qf]BL[2245.031]
;W[gj]WL[2104.987]C[I decide to try and split the Black groups in hopes of solidifying the bottom in the midst of the attack.]
;B[nm]BL[2167.428]LB[oo:A]C[Black threatens to cut at A.]
;W[mo]WL[2078.831]C[Protect the cut while starting to solidify the bottom.]
;B[oi]BL[2154.32]
;W[ni]WL[2071.107]TR[pi]C[Again, the marked stone is no longer important, best to just make shape.]
;B[oj]BL[2149.725]
;W[nh]WL[2067.515]
;B[gp]BL[2124.206]C[Black starts to gain more eye shape.]
;W[hq]WL[2063.936]C[Simple descend to protect the bottom.]
;B[ho]BL[2112.161]
;W[io]WL[2060.78]
;B[go]BL[2110.412]
;W[im]WL[2045.388]LB[jn:A]TR[el][hl][fm][fo][go][ho][dp][ep][gp][cq][dq]C[I thought this tiger's mouth would be more efficient since it would threaten to cut off the marked Black group, however, Black's group is essentially alive. And it also leaves Black with the peep at A and a chance to invade White's bottom. So not the best idea in the end.]
;B[gq]BL[2088.103]
;W[gr]WL[2040.236]
;B[fr]BL[2085.022]
;W[hr]WL[2039.248]LB[jn:A][ko:B]C[Now that Black is solid and sente, he should probably consider trying to reduce the bottom with a move like A or B.]
;B[il]BL[2074.025]C[This push looks like is helps the center, but the center has little potential since White has stones on both sides.]
;W[jm]WL[2035.93]C[And in the end, it only helps White further solidify the bottom.]
;B[hi]BL[2023.289]
;W[ff]WL[2011.81]C[This wedge was an overplay on my part.]
;B[ef]BL[2002.282]C[Black atari's from the correct direction.]
;W[gf]WL[2009.019]C[White extends once to maximize aji potential for later on.]
;B[ee]BL[2000.897]C[Black must connect.]
;W[df]WL[2005.37]C[And then White seals up the left side.]
;B[hg]BL[1992.058]C[Black wants to quell the aji left here.]
;W[ec]WL[1977.296]LB[gd:A]C[This bump is in preparation for possible tesuji at A while protecting the corner from big endgame pushes.]
;B[ge]BL[1941.63]C[Black swiftly dodges it.]
;W[kh]WL[1915.26]C[This move is meant to further negate the center while gaining eye space for White.]
;B[rm]BL[1934.734]C[This move is very big. In fact, White should have probably played here instead of the L12 move.]
;W[nn]WL[1904.872]LB[ps:A]C[This move seems a little dubious to me now. Perhaps the double sente push at A would be better.]

;W[db]WL[1686.454]
;B[fb]BL[1571.16]
;W[kj]WL[1678.254]LB[ea:A]C[This is very small. White should have went ahead and played the reverse sente move at A instead.]

;W[dd]WL[1673.618]
;B[cb]BL[1518.839]LB[da:A][bg:B]C[Looks like an unreasonable invasion, but if White tries to simply cut off the stones, Black sliding at B will not be fun.]

Although some might argue it's pointless, I think that practicing ko threats is a great way to identify weaknesses in your opponent's position. And you never know when your opponent decides to ignore a threat that's actually worth more than the ko you're fighting. Just my two cents on it though.]
