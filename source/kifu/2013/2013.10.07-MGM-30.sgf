;B[pd]C[Acknowledgements:

Thanks to RisingStar for letting me use our game!]
;W[dc]C[3-4 komoku with the strong side facing the star point.]
;B[pq]
;W[cp]C[Exposes the weak side to the strong side of the lower right 3-4, but this is done in anticipation of the Chinese Opening.]
;B[ep]C[Black's approach here is a good asking move.]
;W[po]C[But White knows better than to respond since none of the board has yet to be defined. So White asks Black what he would like to do.]
;B[qo]LB[qn:A]C[Black attaches here with the idea that White will most likely follow the joseki at A, but I find that giving Black a nice corner and sente to also determine what happens in the lower left corner is not acceptable for White.]
;W[pp]C[So I descend.]
;B[qp]
;W[oq]
;B[qn]LB[qq:A]C[Black's extension here is good since it prevents White from sealing him in while making territory. White cannot cut at A and take the corner since White is too thin. See variation to if you need confirmation.]
(;W[pr]C[Which is why White atari's from this side to continue building thickness.]
;B[qq]
;W[hp]LB[np:A]C[Though the joseki on the lower right is not quite finished (White is normally supposed to defend at A, I played this pincer in regards to whole board thinking and trying to make the most of my right side.]
;B[dn]LB[dm:A]C[This knight's move is aggressive. Normal play is the large knight's move. This move asks for a fight.]
;W[eo]C[So White obliges by cutting and preparing to fight.]
;B[fo]LB[do:A]C[This here is too passive by Black. Black must play at A and continue the fight.]
;W[do]C[This allows White to easily split Black into two groups while strengthening himself.]
;B[gp]C[This move makes shape for Black's stones, but by kicking the H4 stone, Black is helping White start to solidify the bottom.]
;W[ho]
;B[gq]C[This move aims to undercut White's bottom]
;W[hq]C[So White chooses to protect.]
;B[fn]TR[dn]C[This aims to connect with the marked stone.]
;W[en]C[White will clearly separate.]
;B[fm]C[This extension is nice shape for Black and helps him escape into the center.]
;W[dm]C[I decide to firmly capture this stone to ensure that the stone does not run out later and cause my group to become very weak.]
;B[qk]LB[de:A][hm:B]TR[qn][qo][qp][pq][qq]C[This move is alright territorially speaking, but it is slow in regards to the whole board. Black's marked group is very stable, so the two space jump is not necessary at this point. Instead, Black should consider moving out to A or B. A is big since it would prevent a corner enclosure, but B might be more urgent since it helps to further secutre his weak group. It's more of a preference at this point.]
;W[nc]C[Standard knight's approach.]
;B[ld]C[This one space pincer is an aggressive move.]
;W[qf]C[I decided to switch directions here because I thought Black's right side was getting too big for my liking, but in reality, Black's right side has little potential for growth since the R9 stone is on the third line.]
;B[qe]
;W[pf]
;B[ob]C[This move tries to protect the corner, but unfortunately the 3-3 invasion is still very much a possibility. In addition, White's O17 stone is not quite done yet.]
;W[qi]C[White decies to make a base here first since getting chased would be bad.]
;B[pj]C[Black tries to put pressure on White.]
;W[ne]C[Now White threatens to connect.]
;B[nd]C[The wedge here is very aggressive. The problem with it is the White gets to choose what is most beneficial to him.]
;W[md]C[I decided this direction was better for me since it separated the Black groups clearly and helped support my R14 group.]
;B[od]LB[mc:A][me:B]C[Multiple Choice Question: Which side to connect? A or B?]
;W[me]TR[nc]C[B is the correct answer in this case since White's original goal is to help the R14 group. In addition, the marked stone is not important anymore, White is happy to sacrifice it to seal Black in.]
;B[rh]C[Here is a great example of the kyu player habit of trying to kill groups / steal eyes too early in the process. It's true. This stone cannot be captured, but what you must remember is that White simply wants to reduce the size of Black's right side. Therefore, if White can simply run out, that is sufficient.]
;W[lc]LB[mh:A]C[I decide to protect the cutting point because there may be a possibility for me to capture the corner later, but this is wishful thinking and not a good idea in reality. Similar to my point earlier, White should just run out into the center and make flexible shape with a move like A..]
;B[ej]LB[gd:B][de:A]C[The purpose of this move seems to be to prevent White from building a left moyo. However, due to the fact that it's on the fifth line and not pressure any group, it's not very effective. Black should probably be more concerned with the A or B area since White is threatening to turn that into a framework.]
;W[de]C[I decide to enclose the corner high in order to maximize potential of building the top side.]
;B[fd]C[This is a nice play by Black.]
;W[hd]TR[lc][md][me]C[White will naturally pincer to try and make use of the thickness to the right.]
;B[ge]C[This move is a little aggressive, but you'll see what Black had in mind.]
;W[he]C[I decide to block here to try and make some territory while putting pressure on the Black stones.]
;B[gf]LB[fg:A]C[The extension here is a little slow and rather heavy. Black should consider a faster haengma at A instead.]
;W[ig]C[Here I was focused on growing my torp, but in reality, there's not very much potential here. ]
;B[dg]LB[cd:A]C[Black takes an important point here, and now White's corner is about to come into question. For those wondering what I'm concerned with, it's the weakness at A.]
;W[cg]C[So I attach here since black is pretty strong now and the likelihood of me killing him is close to none.]
;B[dh]
;W[cf]C[Keeps my stones connected and strengthening my corner.]
;B[ch]
;W[bh]C[I decide to hane and play out this sequence to make my stones absolutely secure, but this is unnecessary since there are more urgent points on the board and White is not necessarily in too much danger yet.]
;B[bi]
;W[ag]
;B[cl]C[Black now threatens my left group. Nice job to Black for recognizing my weakness.]
;W[dq]C[So I choose to take the corner while establishing an area for my group to live.]
;B[lo]C[Nice reduction by Black here.]
;W[no]LB[op:A]C[I choose to protect the cut at A, but this is small and not very smart by me.]
;B[lq]C[Now White is separated into two different groups. Things are not looking so good for White.]
;W[kp]C[This peep seems pretty bad now, but the idea was to gain some shape for White's H3 group.]
;B[lp]
;W[jn]C[And now White tries to make shape.]
;B[mn]C[Black feels that he is heavy, but in reality, his solid shape is wonderful for putting pressure on both groups.]
;W[om]C[When trying to make life, try to escape before just making small life. Getting sealed in is usually very painful and has large implications for the rest of the game.]
;B[ir]
;W[hr]C[I decide I must descend to possibly connect with the left group and also hope to gain enough strength to counter attack the M3 group.]
;B[jq]
;W[mr]C[I extend here to gain more eye space and possibly remove Black's base.]
;B[lr]
;W[nr]
;B[jo]TR[kp]C[This move attemps to capture the marked stone, but White does not have time to save it at the moment.]
;W[in]C[So White connects solidly in hopes to run into the center. And in retrospect, this is probably a better shape than this very unimaginative connection.]
;B[jp]C[Black decides to remove the weakness of and secure his group.]
;W[qr]LB[ik:B][es:A]TR[in][jn][ho][hp][hq][hr]C[So the marked group at this point has two points for not getting killed. A and B. So I decide to further secure the lower right group.]
;B[rr]
;W[rf]C[Here I decide to try my hand at possibly capturing the corner.]
;B[re]
;W[nb]
;B[oc]
;W[qc]C[This seemed like a reasonable vital point, but Black's area is pretty big.]
;B[rc]
;W[rb]
;B[sc]
;W[sb]
;B[qd]
;W[pb]
;B[qa]
;W[oa]
;B[qb]C[And Black does a magnificent job making life.]
;W[na]C[This move is dubious and unnecessary. Black is alive.]
;B[pc]C[Luckily Black responds, so White gets sente back.]
;W[np]C[I decide to completely secure my group here since I have a feeling there is a way to reduce White to only one eye.]
;B[ll]
;W[jk]LB[es:A]C[Since the jump at A is still an option, I decide that this is agood time to reduce Black's center potential and go ahead and strengthen my own group.]
;B[ji]C[Here Black is aggressive thinking of cutting off the group.]
;W[ii]C[I decide to attach and see how Black wants to cut.]
;B[kj]LB[ih:A][ij:B][jj:C]C[I'm surprised here when he decide to back off. Black should have considered A, B, or C to weaken the White group.]
;W[ij]C[So White takes the solid connection.]
;B[jh]
;W[gi]LB[ih:A][fk:B]C[Connecting at A is unimaginative, this is move efficient and also has implications towards the left Black group. By this point, I had build enough power that I was aiming at the weakness with the large night move at B.]
;B[mg]LB[of:A]C[Black is threatening the cut at A now.]
;W[fk]TR[om]C[But I decide that I could sacrifice those stones since the marked White stone on the bottom can still help to reduce the territory. In addition, I was pretty sure this would be a bigger gain for White here. So time to cut!]
;B[el]
;W[em]LB[fl:A]C[Black needs to connect at A for any hopes of living.]
;B[fj]
;W[fl]C[Unfortunately White has too many liberties and Black is too thin for the cut to be protected.]
;B[er]C[Black now tries to widen his eye space.]
;W[dr]C[Though it may not be entirely necessary, when under time pressure, it's important to remember that the White corner is not completely alive yet and Black may be able to kill if if White is not careful. So this block is a safe move.]
;B[gl]TR[fk][fl]C[Black tries to capture the marked cutting stones.]
;W[gk]
;B[hn]LB[io:A]C[Black is clearly threatening to cut at A, but before responding, it is always good to ask yourself if you have any useful forcing moves before connecting.]
;W[hm]LB[jl:A][jm:B]C[This move is nice since it helps to strengthen the two space jump at A and B.]
;B[gn]
;W[io]
;B[hl]
;W[il]C[Now even though White looks perfectly safe, this is still a lot of aji left.]
;B[hk]TR[fk][gk][fl]C[Black is threatning to capture the marked cutting stones.]
;W[gj]LB[ik:A]C[White obligingly saves them. At this point, a move at A by Black will cut White apart and start a capturing race. This is Black's last hope. See variation.]
(;B[hj]C[Unfortunately, Black removes his last chance with this push. This violates the principle of trying to cut the bamboo joint. ]
;W[hi]LB[ik:A]C[Now Black cannot cut at A since it would be self atari.]
;B[gm]
;W[ik]C[White repairs his defect.]
;B[go]
;W[eq]C[This move again is probably unnecessary, but I was worried about the possible capturing race and though to simplify is as much as possible.]
;B[im]
;W[jm]
;B[gr]
;W[hs]C[With the group cut off and dead, Black resigns here.])
(;B[ik]
;W[jl]
;B[jj]LB[ih:A]C[White is cut apart now and there is a capturing race. White probably needs to conenct at A now since otherwise Black will also cut this group off and make if difficult for White.]))
