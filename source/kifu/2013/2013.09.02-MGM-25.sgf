;B[pd]BL[1192.523]
;W[dp]WL[1192.133]
;B[qp]BL[1188.13]C[Though this 3-4's weak side faces the star point, this is okay due to the intent of utilizing a synergy of the strong side with the star point in the upper left.]
;W[dd]WL[1188.646]
;B[fq]BL[1186.169]C[Probe to determine White's intentions.]
;W[ip]WL[1186.676]C[White's pincer here shows he intends to complicate things a bit.]
;B[nq]BL[1148.219]C[I decided to do the large knight enclosure to provide some assistance if a fight broke out in the F3 area.]
;W[fp]WL[1182.792]C[Now that White has attached on top, I decide not to further compound impact of the area on the rest of the board by trying to fight or invade just yet.]
;B[pj]BL[1133.946]C[So I take a big point in regards to my fuseki formation.]
;W[nd]WL[1176.583]
;B[pf]BL[1083.659]C[I respond with the high one space approach to keep consistent with strengthening the right side.]
;W[pc]WL[1160.845]C[I thought this attachment as a little weird, but I guess White wanted to settle.]
;B[qc]BL[1060.466]C[Block/Semi-protect the corner.]
;W[oc]WL[1154.86]
;B[cj]BL[1038.03]C[And then I take the last big point on the board to prevent any simple synergy between White's stones.]
;W[qb]WL[1151.413]C[White plays here with the expectation that I'll connect or descend, but I decide that I'm okay giving up the corner in exchange for getting the opportunity to take the initiative elsewhere on the board.]
;B[cf]BL[968.185]LB[cc:C][ce:B][ch:A]C[The three space extension here is a little loose but provides Black with options. It does leave an invasion point at A, but White can no longer kick at B without giving Black ideal shape and Black still has the option of 3-3 if he wants.]
;W[fc]WL[1142.759]
;B[cn]BL[893.567]C[I decided to play a little faster with another 3 space extension.]
;W[co]WL[1139.062]C[I was happy to be kicked since the bottom left corner was not quite complete yet.]
;B[dn]BL[890.933]
;W[jc]WL[1132.031]C[Here White tries to maintain some sort of synergy on the top.]
;B[no]BL[857.246]LB[ef:A][kq:B]C[I decided to grow expand my corner while preparing defenses for an invasion. Though moves like A and B did cross my mind.]
;W[ph]WL[1116.435]
;B[qh]BL[801.481]C[I decided to try to connect and simplify things.]
;W[qi]WL[1110.447]
;B[pi]BL[798.376]
;W[qg]WL[1109.472]C[I realize that I cannot connect properly here due to a cutting point at P14. See variation.]
(;B[rh]BL[777.439]C[I decided to descend and start solidifying the right side.]
;W[pg]WL[1107.479]
;B[nf]BL[756.101]C[Jumping out lightly to get shape.]
;W[rg]WL[1103.265]C[I considered ignoring this, but I realized that it would create holes in my right side and not to mention cut apart my groups. I already had one weak group, and I was not interested in creating another.]
;B[ri]BL[742.582]
;W[nh]WL[1088.551]
;B[lf]BL[720.715]C[Jump into the center to try and find some way to live.]
;W[oe]WL[1083.937]
;B[of]BL[714.714]C[No other choice. Cannot afford to get cut off and try to live in such a cramped space.]
;W[pe]WL[1081.65]
;B[qf]BL[709.154]C[Sacrificing the corner.]
;W[mg]WL[1063.552]C[Nice peep by White that makes me infinitely more heavy.]
;B[mf]BL[687.581]
;W[qd]WL[1058.769]
;B[rf]BL[680.185]C[I play here to fully cut off White and possibly gain some forcing moves to possibly make an eye later on.]
;W[sg]WL[1052.157]
;B[nj]BL[622.162]LB[oh:A]C[Here I try to mount a counter attack while further solidifying my right side. If white ignored me, I was planning on wedging at A.]
;W[mi]WL[1032.117]LB[oh:A]C[Wedge at A no longer works...]
;B[lg]BL[584.474]
;W[mj]WL[1009.509]
;B[nk]BL[564.263]
;W[ki]WL[1002.509]
;B[oh]BL[547.917]C[I decide to wedge now to possibly make an eye, but this is a little premature. I should save this for later.]
;W[og]WL[987.502]
;B[ng]BL[545.836]
;W[oi]WL[985.671]
;B[mh]BL[541.892]
;W[ni]WL[984.188]
;B[if]BL[493.379]LB[kh:A]C[Though I could definitely form one solid eye at A, I thought it best to run some more while I had the chance.]
;W[ch]WL[956.172]LB[cc:A][ef:B]C[With White's invasion here, I have two choices. A or B. In hindsight, I think B may have been better since it actually helps the O14 group at the same time.]
;B[cc]BL[475.151]C[I decide I want some territory and play it safe.]
;W[cd]WL[946.988]
;B[bd]BL[461.751]
;W[be]WL[944.73]
;B[bc]BL[460.789]

;W[ed]WL[934.208]
;B[dc]BL[457.452]
;W[fe]WL[931.737]C[But now White has pretty nice thickness that will be troublesome for my O14 group.]
;B[dh]BL[432.494]C[I don't think much of it at the time though, and resume to try and maximize the C14 aji as much as possible.]
;W[di]WL[914.203]
;B[ci]BL[426.606]
;W[dg]WL[912.962]
;B[eh]BL[424.954]
;W[cg]WL[911.147]
;B[ej]BL[417.058]C[Nice and simple.]
;W[eg]WL[900.875]
;B[fh]BL[413.077]C[Prevent from being hit on the head of two stones again.]
;W[hg]WL[896.671]C[Now I realize I'm in trouble.]
;B[kh]BL[376.342]C[So I form my first eye.]
;W[ii]WL[884.051]
;B[jh]BL[363.231]C[Trying to get more shape here.]
;W[ji]WL[880.93]
;B[lc]BL[338.991]C[And then a mini-invasion while creating more aji in case I need it for another eye.]
;W[rp]WL[848.455]C[White's attachment here is a little hopeful. I think he was hoping to live.]
;B[qq]BL[299.014]C[But I had a solid move and some thickness that I was ready to use.]
;W[ro]WL[806.669]LB[qo:A]C[This was a bad move. I was fully expecting a hane at R5 to try and make sabaki. But this is heavy and does not have White very much.]
;B[rm]BL[258.742]C[So even though I have some thickness in the Q10 area, I know it's a little thin and choose to reinforce it.]
;W[rq]WL[776.026]
;B[rr]BL[254.121]C[Here I know I can safely hane, so I do to prevent White from getting any easy eyes.]
;W[sr]WL[740.021]
;B[qr]BL[245.722]
;W[qk]WL[738.668]
;B[qj]BL[230.538]C[I was happy that White removed the aji for the Q11 stone.]
;W[qm]WL[734.515]C[And this wasn't threatning to me since I knew I could connect under.]
;B[rk]BL[216.322]LB[oj:A][ok:B][pk:C]C[So I connected under to not only to minimize White's eye space, but to also make the push and cut at A B C to be less threatening.]
;W[rn]WL[722.826]C[Hooray... now White has 1 eye in gote.]
;B[rl]BL[205.794]
;W[pn]WL[662.341]
;B[qo]BL[180.168]
;W[qn]WL[652.784]
;B[nm]BL[169.243]C[Reinforcing my connections for the upcoming struggle.]
;W[nn]WL[620.073]
;B[on]BL[131.463]C[I decided to cut on the inside due to time and to be safe, but the outside it possible as well.]
;W[om]WL[612.467]C[I was a little surprised by this counter atari.]
;B[mn]BL[128.181]C[But didn't see much threat once I made my ponnuki.]
;W[ol]WL[590.202]
;B[pk]BL[105.748]LB[mk:C][ml:B][nl:A]C[While some might instinctively block at A, I wanted to ensure that I could destroy White's second eye through two different ways while strengthening my connection and making the push and cut at A B C less threatning.]
;W[nl]WL[555.752]
;B[ml]BL[101.948]
;W[gq]WL[510.646]
;B[cq]BL[89.936]C[So here is me trying to make life here. I think it's actually possible, but my L&D skills are rather abysmal.]
;W[cp]WL[505.616]LB[br:B][dr:A]C[I think A might be the proper move, or B, but I can't say for sure.]
;B[dq]BL[70.203]C[This seems okay, but with the g3 stones already blocking that route, it doesn't work out very well.]
;W[eq]WL[488.824]
;B[bp]BL[65.007]
;W[bo]WL[487.05]
;B[er]BL[62.384]
;W[fr]WL[485.307]
;B[br]BL[35.223]
;W[ap]WL[479.707]
;B[aq]BL[10.284]C[So the best I can try for is a ko.]
;W[bq]WL[461.714]
;B[kk]BL[30]OB[4]C[And I make this lackuster threat. How pitiful. The idea behind it was to posibly kill the S13 group, but it's really not that menacing.]
;W[ar]WL[434.692]
;B[ih]BL[30]OB[4]C[So I follow up on my threat.]
;W[hh]WL[425.154]
;B[hi]BL[30]OB[4]

;B[gi]BL[30]OB[4]
;W[ik]WL[406.628]
;B[in]BL[30]OB[3]C[And now I try to threaten to cut off the group.]

;B[hn]BL[30]OB[3]
;W[fl]WL[275.075]
;B[fn]BL[30]OB[3]C[Group is now cut off more or less!]
;W[jk]WL[261.55]
;B[kj]BL[30]OB[3]LB[li:A]C[And then I get a little too zealous here in hopes to wedge at A.]
;W[ll]WL[174.357]
;B[kl]BL[30]OB[3]
;W[lm]WL[166.145]
;B[mm]BL[30]OB[3]C[Can't let White double atari here....]

;W[im]WL[145.381]
;B[li]BL[30]OB[2]
;W[dl]WL[32.032]C[While a decent threat, not that big considering Black will gain around 30 points by winning this ko.]
;B[oh]BL[30]OB[2]C[So I wrap it up and proceed to see what he has planned next.]
