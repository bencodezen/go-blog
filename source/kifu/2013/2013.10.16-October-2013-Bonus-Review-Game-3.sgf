;B[pd]BL[2670.464]
;W[dc]WL[2686.627]C[Strong side of 3-4 komoku facing the star point.]
;B[pq]BL[2658.919]
;W[cp]WL[2647.614]C[While this exposes the weak side of the 3-4 komoku to Black's strong lower right, this is a specific strategy meant to counter the Chinese by enclosing the corner.]
;B[eq]BL[2545.493]C[Black approaches low this time. My first time encountering this in my experiments thus far.]
;W[po]WL[2580.461]C[So I decide to continue to tenuki approach like before, but I'm unsure of what may happen.]
;B[np]BL[2471.976]C[My opponent has seen my past games experimenting with this opening, so this alternative to the attachment is a nice way to counter my aim.
]
;W[qq]WL[2469.999]C[I decide to do the attach and extend joseki to settle my group.]
;B[qr]BL[2402.064]
;W[qp]WL[2459.104]C[Extend to keep my group connected.]
;B[rr]BL[2327.399]LB[qk:A][or:B]C[This move is wrong in regards to the whole board context. Black normally only extends at S2 when a pincer stone already exists at the A area. The proper move is at B.]
;W[qk]WL[2357.733]LB[qm:A][oq:B]C[This extension is a little thin since there is a weakness at A, but my rationale at the time was trying to develop faster and take advantage of the weakness at B later on.]
;B[jq]BL[2208.212]TR[eq][jq]C[So I'm evaluating the board, and I feel like the bottom is looing for Black. However, this is a good example of kyu player jealousy. Black's marked stones are on the third line and will be hard to grow, so White should be calm in his response. No need to be hasty.]
;W[gp]WL[2213.305]LB[cm:A]C[White should have kept it simple with a move like A, but this pincer shows immaturity in evaluating the board position.]
;B[eo]BL[2054.021]TR[gp]C[Now Black has a weak group to attack. Not good for White.]
;W[dn]WL[2172.859]C[Knight's move to the fourth line to prevent from being pressed down.]
;B[go]BL[1785.291]
;W[ho]WL[2024.848]C[I am thinking that I can make sabaki here and reduce his bottom, but I am at a severe disadvantage in this fight.]
;B[gn]BL[1714.789]
;W[fp]WL[1971.764]C[I play here to remove black's vital point.]
;B[ep]BL[1694.796]C[But this only strengthens Black to against the corner. A very very bad move by White.]
;W[jo]WL[1941.78]LB[hp:A]C[There is a cut here at A, but White cannot afford to try to protect it right now unless he wants to make his group super heavy.]
;B[hp]BL[1684.48]
;W[ip]WL[1811.567]C[So White tries this sacrifice tactic.]
;B[hq]BL[1666.889]
;W[iq]WL[1803.275]
;B[gq]BL[1618.32]
;W[kq]WL[1761.216]C[And tries to establish a position at the bottom.]
;B[lq]BL[1575.259]LB[jr:A]TR[gn][eo][go][ep][hp][eq][gq][hq]C[White could capture at stone at A right now, but I decide I wanted influence (though in hindsight, there is no reason to think I will be able to use it effectively due to Black's strong marked group).]
;W[lp]WL[1678.817]C[So I decide to hane instead.]
;B[kr]BL[1406.659]
;W[kp]WL[1655.332]C[Must obviously connect.]
;B[lr]BL[1301.979]
;W[no]WL[1609.457]LB[oq:A]C[Note that this entire time, I'm staring at the weakness at A trying to find some way to take advantage of it, so I'm trying to seal Black in and hopefully call into quesiton the life of the entire group (which is a terrible idea and a prime example of kyu player "wishful thinking"). It's just bad juju.]
;B[qg]BL[1210.84]LB[nc:A]C[I think Black was correct to tenuki here. Althouhg I might argue that it is the wrong direction. The enclosure around the A area seems bigger.]
;W[jd]WL[1440.55]LB[nc:A]C[So I decide to take a big point and threaten to approach at A.]
;B[cl]BL[1175.877]C[But then Black takes a critical point in White's shape and now White is in trouble.]
;W[cj]WL[1249.853]C[I try to play more clever and counter pincer to also try and develop the upper left.]
;B[bn]BL[1128.04]C[This slide is very painful for White, it will be very difficult if not impossible for White to live now.]
;W[bo]WL[1153.964]C[I decide to kick and see if I can get some shape going.]
;B[cn]BL[1111.495]
;W[dr]WL[1109.563]C[Trying to expand my eye shape.]
;B[bq]BL[945.244]C[Black strikes the vital point.]
;W[bp]WL[988.082]C[Empty triangle to prevent connection.]
;B[cr]BL[874.429]
;W[cq]WL[953.045]C[At this point, I believe I might be reading out a possible seki.]
;B[br]BL[842.237]
;W[dq]WL[918.858]C[Connect.]
;B[er]BL[836.088]
;W[ds]WL[869.288]C[Cut off the group while keeping my eye space bigger.]
;B[ao]BL[770.938]
;W[ap]WL[830.477]C[Prevent black from connecting.]
;B[do]BL[759.933]C[And with this White's fate is sealed, but I unfortunately am still delusional and have read out a miraculous sequence where I live.]
;W[ar]WL[740.294]C[At the time, I was relieved cause I thought I found a way to live.]
;B[bs]BL[740.142]
;W[cs]WL[686.254]LB[as:A]C[And then to rub in more salt to the wound, I add a move to the dead group not realizing that I'm actually very dead now.  If you're wondering what I saw, I thought White could throw in at A twice and make a living shape. The only thing I forgot is that Black has no reason to respond.]
;B[ce]BL[703.819]C[So since I effectively passed my turn and handed Black another point, you can imagine how painful this approach was.]
;W[cg]WL[669.905]C[Pincer while establishing a base.]
;B[ee]BL[449.097]
;W[fd]WL[654.935]C[Knight's move to keep pressure on the group.]
;B[dh]BL[362.583]C[At this point, it's looking abysmal for White. There is little chance of coming back, but I feel that I still should fight onwards.]
;W[ch]WL[632.667]C[Extend to maintain connection.]
;B[di]BL[305.083]LB[ci:A]C[While connecting at A is normal, White must fight back.]
;W[dg]WL[604.732]C[Stand up.]
;B[eg]BL[189.395]
;W[ef]WL[577.246]C[And wedge to try and complicate the situation.]
;B[ff]BL[116.722]
;W[df]WL[566.475]
;B[fe]BL[109.173]
;W[de]WL[537.817]TR[ce]C[Cutting off the marked stone.]
;B[ed]BL[103.976]
;W[dd]WL[512.967]
;B[gd]BL[42.044]C[And though White may feel successful at gaining fourth line territory in the corner, his top has been invaded and things are looking grim.]
;W[fg]WL[454.889]C[And to make things worse, I make this atari thinking I have the ladder, but you'll soon see I forgot about one very important tesuji.]
;B[eh]BL[9.652]
;W[fc]WL[428.798]C[So I'm trying desperately to cut off the group and kill something at this point.]
;B[gg]BL[581.964]OB[24]C[And then when I read it out a little bit, I realize that Black has me in a net. Crap... (See variation if you think you can run out.)]
(;W[nc]WL[368.113]C[So now I'm just making big overplays to find some miracle of turning the game around.]
;B[pc]BL[543.806]OB[23]C[Black's solid iron pillar enclosure was a great response.]
;W[qi]WL[299.428]LB[qe:A]C[Here's me trying to aim at the weakness at A and cause problems.]
;B[ec]BL[536.246]OB[22]
;W[gc]WL[279.668]C[I turn to prevent Black from capturing these stones.]
;B[eb]BL[527.199]OB[21]
;W[db]WL[267.58]C[I defend my corner with a tesuji in mind.]
;B[hc]BL[506.042]OB[20]
;W[fh]WL[254.045]C[And then I try to extend thinking I have found a way to turn the game around.]
;B[gi]BL[496.292]OB[19]
;W[ge]WL[242.448]
;B[hd]BL[481.641]OB[18]LB[gf:A]C[Except I failed to realize that I'm actually one liberty short of the cut at A working.]
;W[gh]WL[220.554]LB[gf:A]C[And then I make another epic 30 kyu misread and try to escape and still make use of the A cut.]
;B[hh]BL[422.039]OB[17]C[And Black shuts down my miserable delusion and I am at a loss for words for myself.]
;W[ne]WL[151.858]C[So at this point, I'm just trying anything I can.
]
;B[lb]BL[368.666]OB[16]
;W[qe]WL[128.074]C[Trying to complicate things.]
;B[of]BL[353.403]OB[15]
;W[rg]WL[105.149]C[Threaten to connect.]
;B[rh]BL[332.819]OB[14]

;B[re]BL[216.811]OB[11]
;W[pe]WL[13.176]
;B[qd]BL[206.509]OB[10]C[So now I've succeeded in reducing Black's corner and expanded possible center potential.... It's slim for me to convert the center into territory... but a chance...]
;W[nq]WL[568.168]OW[24]C[So now I try to kill the bottom.]
;B[nr]BL[186.559]OB[9]C[Calm move by Black.]
;W[oq]WL[547.137]OW[23]C[I finaly utilize the weakness here, but it's a little late and not really gaining me much.]

;B[ir]BL[144.593]OB[7]

;B[nf]BL[133.445]OB[5]
;W[ng]WL[481.04]OW[19]C[I'm happy to plod along and try to seal in the center, but realize that Black is also starting to seal in the top which would give him a convincing lead.]
;B[mf]BL[117.297]OB[4]
;W[lh]WL[456.634]OW[18]
;B[kj]BL[109.699]OB[3]C[When Black invades here, I try to find a way to punish it, but I can't since i'm running out of time.]
;W[jh]WL[393.884]OW[17]C[So I play here hoping to connect to the top and destroy the top while keeping as much of the center as possible.]
;B[ij]BL[84.077]OB[2]
;W[lk]WL[347.014]OW[16]
;B[lj]BL[60.78]OB[1]C[\]]
;W[fi]WL[301.213]OW[15]C[So here is not a misread, I'm trying to create aji and make the board terribly complicated.]

;B[gj]BL[588.388]OB[24]

;B[kh]BL[522.901]OB[21]
