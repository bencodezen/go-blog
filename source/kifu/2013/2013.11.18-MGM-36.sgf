;B[pd]BL[1195.977]C[Standard star point opening.]
;W[dp]WL[1193.444]C[By playing here in this corner, whether it was intentional or not, White ensures that Black does not choose a cross-fuseki.]
;B[oq]BL[1192.599]C[In all honesty, you cannot understand how flabbergasted I am at myself for playing the 5-3 point here. *pats past self on the back for being gutsy* xD]
;W[dd]WL[1189.516]C[Calm ninrensei by White.]
;B[qp]BL[1190.526]C[I seriously did not realize my 13kyu self could even create such a fuseki. Haha.]
;W[dj]WL[1186.027]C[Sanrensei! How interesting! ]
;B[pj]BL[1186.722]C[At 13 kyu, I'm shocked I chose such acalm opening.]
;W[nc]WL[1176.3]
;B[jc]BL[1171.669]C[A 3-space pincer? I seriously can't stop surprising myself this game. ]
;W[qc]WL[1167.362]
;B[qd]BL[1159.304]C[And I blocked on the right side?! WHAT?!]
;W[pc]WL[1160.798]
;B[od]BL[1155.187]C[I took the vital point! o.O]
;W[rc]WL[1145.99]
;B[rd]BL[1152.059]C[Clearly still protecting the left. Everything looks normal.]
;W[nb]WL[1144.779]C[What a calm move by White.]
;B[nd]BL[1137.791]LB[jp:A]C[A little slow, but hard to argue with this solid move at 13 kyu. Would have been bigger to take a point like A.]
;W[lc]WL[1124.677]
;B[kd]BL[1126.402]LB[jp:A]C[Here is a clear example of following the opponent around the board. A is still the biggest point left on the board.]
;W[jq]WL[1116.736]
;B[fc]BL[1108.101]C[Nice approach.]
;W[df]WL[1110.855]

;W[on]WL[1019.192]
;B[nm]BL[1058.902]C[I'm clearly trying to kill the group now, but from a stronger player's perspect, I'm also sealing White's group in.]

;B[pl]BL[1052.348]C[Attach? Hane!]
;W[pm]WL[1001.839]

;W[nl]WL[945.512]
;B[mm]BL[1008.521]C[Connected to save the stone.]
;W[mk]WL[926.142]
;B[np]BL[995.631]C[I guess I was worried about the connection at this point. Slow in terms of the whole board, but I think it was neat that I noticed it.]
;W[kk]WL[919.422]
;B[fj]BL[992.194]TR[kk][mk][nl][ol][om][pm][nn][on][qn]C[I seriously can't stop surprising myself this game. This is not the best example of a leaning attack, but I'm clearlying thinking about getting some reinforcements on the left side since the White group is not alive yet.]

;W[db]WL[911.88]
;B[fb]BL[974.469]LB[ed:A]TR[eb]C[This move was to save the marked black stone, but the atari at A is the correct move.]
;W[ed]WL[905.9]C[Bad shape.]
;B[fd]BL[972.25]C[And Black gets ideal shape in response.]
;W[cp]WL[903.058]
;B[fo]BL[966.182]C[Wow... The level of control I'm seeing from my 13k self is astounding me.]

;W[mi]WL[807.038]C[NOOOOOOO]
;B[lg]BL[804.477]C[A small move that reeks of feeling so sad that the White group I had successfully killed came back alive. xD]
;W[of]WL[784.129]
;B[ne]BL[799.635]C[From this point on, my game progresses like a dog with his tail between his legs for sham of not being able to keep the White group dead.]
