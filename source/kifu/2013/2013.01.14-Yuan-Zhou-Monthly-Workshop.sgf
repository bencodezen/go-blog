;W[ko]
;B[jo]
;W[lm]
;B[cn]LB[jl:A]C[Tenuki is bad. Black should continue the attack with A.]
;W[nc]
;B[pf]
;W[jd]
;B[jl]
;W[cp]
;B[ck]TR[lm][ko][oo][mp]C[Black should not respond. Should continue attack on triangled group instead.]
;W[cf]
;B[fc]LB[eb:A]C[Terrible invasion. I knew the kick was coming. And for some reason I thought it would work out in my favor, except I completely forgot taht he already played D14. Sigh. And for those wondering what the better move is, A is.]
;W[ec]
;B[fd]
;W[hc]C[Realized my mistake here....]
;B[ff]
;W[ne]
;B[ln]TR[ko]C[Small attack. White should just give up the triangled stone. Fortunately for me, he chooses to fight back.]
;W[kn]
;B[km]
;W[lo]
;B[mn]
;W[om]C[Was not expecting this response, but after some careful reading. I played the following.]

;W[ml]
;B[nl]
;W[mk]
;B[nn]
;W[qn]
;B[on]LB[po:A]C[Bad move for Black. Should play at A instead to remove any possibility of corner aji and letting him live.2]
;W[po]
;B[qp]
;W[ql]
;B[pk]LB[pk:2][nl:1][pn:A]C[Should not have responded. Should have stuck with the plan and just cut him at A. On the upside, I played this knowing that the two groups could be connected without any issues.]
;W[ol]C[White disagrees.]
;B[ok]
;W[nk]C[I double check my reading here... but I'm pretty sure I have it read out correctly so...]

;W[rq]C[Did not expect this move.....]
;B[nq]LB[ro:A]C[Thought I would lose the entire corner, so I played here, but A would have been better.]
;W[mq]
;B[np]
;W[no]
;B[mo]
;W[nr]C[Read so far up to here, but realized that the hane at A does not work. See variation.]
(;B[pp]
;W[rp]
;B[ro]
;W[so]C[I panic for a second as I think that I will lose the race. See variation for what I envisioned.]
(;B[sn]
;W[sm]
;B[op]
;W[pr]C[I still have one more chance to own the lower right corner, but I blow it with my next move.]
;B[mr]LB[or:A]C[Should be at A instead.]
;W[qq]
;B[sn]
;W[or]C[Now white is alive.]
;B[lr]TR[fc][fd][ff]C[I fail to see that... and in a rush I play a terribly slow move when my triangled group is so weak. This is ultimate tunnel vision. Sigh.]
;W[fh]C[When my opponent plays this, the lead I thought I had was now up in the air if he could kill my group.]
;B[he]C[Get some shape....]
;W[hg]
;B[je]C[Contact move for defense....]
;W[ie]
;B[if]
;W[id]
;B[hf]
;W[jh]
;B[ed]LB[ih:A]C[Slow move. Tesuji at A works to run out and not get sealed in. In my defense, I thought it was sente and would help widen by eye shape.]
;W[dc]
;B[de]C[I thought White would respond....]
;W[ge]C[Ouch....]
;B[gf]
;W[gd]
;B[eg]LB[ee:A][df:B]C[I play here to protect the cut at A, but B would have been a better move.]
;W[eh]
;B[ce]
;W[dg]
;B[df]
;W[cg]LB[bc:A]TR[dc][ec][dd]C[Should just slide to A now and threaten to kill the triangled group.]
;B[fe]C[In my skittishness to make life and protect my lead, I make an eye.]
;W[ef]C[Throw in does not work!]
;B[fg]
;W[cd]SQ[cf][cg][dg][hg][eh][fh][jh]C[I can't see myself making an eye on the left hand side, so I fail to descend, but descending would be in sente and would cut off the squared stones from the corner, giving me another target to attack and help make life.]
;B[kd]C[I play this in preparation for a sequence I read out a little while ago.]
;W[be]C[White gets the sente atari since I'm stupid.]
;B[ee]
;W[jf]C[As I guessed, White went ahead and atari'd.]
;B[hd]C[SEQUENCE ACTIVATE!]
;W[gc]
;B[ic]
;W[jc]
;B[ib]C[Success!!]
;W[gb]
;B[fb]
