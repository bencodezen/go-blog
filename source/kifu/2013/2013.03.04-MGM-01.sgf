;W[cq]WL[1982.438]C[White dives into the corner as predicted.]
;B[cp]BL[1831.27]TR[qo][qp][nq][pq]C[I choose this side since my triangle group already had solid position on the bottom. White cannot make too much territory beneath while Black has some potential on the left.]

;W[cf]WL[1891.024]
;B[fc]BL[1706.705]C[I approached here knowing that a kick was very possible. But seeing as how the K17 stone has no base, and I had thickness on the other side, it couldn't turn out too badly for Black.]
