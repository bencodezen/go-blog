;B[op]BL[1730.928]C[As some people may have noticed, I have been experimenting a lot with this fuseki lately. As far as I'm aware, but the idea is for me to practice "leaving options open."]

;W[hq]WL[1710.359]
;B[jq]BL[1614.367]C[I decide to play a checking extension here to see what White will do while trying to protect the weak side of my shimari.]
;W[gp]WL[1677.161]
;B[cq]BL[1605.518]C[Sinec White chose to prevent my stone from running, I decided this would be a good time to seize the corner and sacrifice the stone.]

;B[cp]BL[1597.084]
;W[em]WL[1644.821]C[I was happy with this result since I got the corner in sente while making the territory around F3 overconcentrated.]
;B[cf]BL[1532.072]LB[jo:A]C[Here I decide to try and use the two spaced approach and see what would happen. I'm not very familiar with it, so here was me experimenting. Though in hindsight, I think a move like A would actually work wel and that white enclosing the corner would not be a big threat since White's position is already low on the top.]
;W[ch]WL[1563.592]
;B[jo]BL[1466.483]LB[cc:1][ed:2][cf:A][ef:3][dg:4][bh:6][dh:5]C[I decide to come back since my stone at A still has multiple options depending on how White responds next.]
;W[pi]WL[1526.087]
;B[pk]BL[1389.704]C[I did not want to submit so easily along the third line, so I fought back.]
;W[qq]WL[1395.191]LB[pq:A]C[A lot of players might think to block at A, but I thought it would be better to confine White to a corner and build thickness for the right hand side.]
;B[rp]BL[1347.326]
;W[ph]WL[1315.914]
;B[qg]BL[1294.112]C[Maintaing connection with the other group while making it harder for White to connect.]
;W[qi]WL[1230.785]
;B[rk]BL[1183.248]C[Giving my two stones another optionto connect while reinforcing my right side.]
;W[mi]WL[1154.158]LB[ki:1][mk:2]SQ[od][pd][qd][me][qe][re][qg][qh]C[Since White has multiple direction to run and my marked group is not very strong yet, I didn't want to embark on an attack just yet.]
;B[pq]BL[1130.488]C[So I figured coming back to silence the corner would be pretty big in terms of cash.]
;W[pf]WL[1130.371]
;B[nd]BL[1071.853]LB[oc:A]C[I'm aiming for a push and cut here at A.]
;W[rf]WL[1080.479]C[White threatens to connect.]
;B[se]BL[952.736]C[This seems rather small now, but I guess the idea is to keep White split and possibly continue some sort of attack later on.]
;W[oc]WL[1051.888]

;W[mg]WL[1023.657]
;B[mb]BL[905.439]
;W[nb]WL[1015.737]
;B[gc]BL[857.969]C[Here I try to extend from my thickness while asking White what he wants to do about the corner.]
;W[cd]WL[979.592]C[White is making a statement that he wants the corner.]
;B[id]BL[758.213]LB[mk:A]C[I think this is a bad move in retrospect since it tries to use thickness to make territory, which is a big proverbial no no. A move like A would be much bigger.]
;W[mk]WL[948.81]C[Nice move by White to reduce Black's right side.]
;B[nm]BL[720.7]C[I decide that it's okay for me to be defensive and take cash since the center is still pretty open.]
;W[in]WL[936.554]
;B[jn]BL[703.733]
;W[nl]WL[910.723]
;B[mm]BL[687.413]C[I decide the bottom is worth more.]
;W[il]WL[908.203]
;B[dh]BL[594.254]C[This is a weird move in hindsight. I guess I was trying to make sabaki and gain a foothold in the center.]

;W[eh]WL[828.661]
;B[bj]BL[465.737]
;W[bk]WL[823.604]C[So now that my group is pretty safe I realize that I am in a prime position to attack the corner.]

;B[eb]BL[424.825]
;W[db]WL[811.036]
;B[bb]BL[414.133]C[Eye stealing tesuji! Though it may have been slightly prematurre since White can still run in the center.]

;W[cb]WL[614.627]C[Thought White survives, I was happy to have sente.]
;B[ir]BL[270.082]C[I thought this would be sente.]
;W[ol]WL[606.361]C[But White is correct in his assessment to push here.]

;B[ig]BL[61.84]C[I think that this is good shape, but the connection is very loose since you must consider the fact that White has stones everywhere.]

;B[ld]BL[56.427]
;W[je]WL[472.536]C[White does a great job exploiting my thin shape.]
;B[jd]BL[40.419]C[I decide the that the top is more valuable and that I can try to live or play lightly in the center.]

;W[ge]WL[429.51]LB[ke:A]C[Here is my mistake. I should have played at A insteadand connected back with my group.]
;B[hd]BL[17.797]C[I think protecting the top is bigger, so I connect.]
;W[ke]WL[418.888]C[Allowing White to connect and cut me off.]
;B[gg]BL[30]OB[5]C[When I played this, I will be honest in that I did not really read out the result. It was rather poor planning in hindsight.]

;B[dg]BL[30]OB[3]C[I realize it here and get excited....]
