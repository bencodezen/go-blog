;B[pp]BL[1790.451]
;W[dp]WL[1793.005]
;B[pc]BL[1775.373]
;W[dd]WL[1790.451]LB[fc:A][gc:B]C[Here I choose ninrensei because I am always keeping in mind the possibility that Black will choose the Chinese Opening. And if he does, that I was prepared with my response at A/B (depending on my mood).]
;B[qi]BL[1762.976]C[Just like I predicted.]
;W[gc]WL[1766.162]LB[fc:A]C[So I choose the larger knight move since it's a little faster and has a bit more reach in regards to negating Black's influence. However, just know that a move at A would not be bad either.]
;B[fp]BL[1737.21]
;W[ip]WL[1737.225]LB[dn:A]C[Here I decide to complicate things a little bit, although it's worth noting that a calm move at A would have been possible as well.]
;B[kp]BL[1710.302]C[This counter pincer was a surprising move. ]
;W[qq]WL[1720.468]LB[ql:6][qm:long][mp:4][np:wide]C[Since all the stones were on the fourth line, I felt that it was silly to commit to any of the stones at the moment. So instead, I invade because regardless of which way Black blocks, I felt that he would either be overconcentrated or a bit thin and would be able to easily negate the power of the wall.]
;B[qp]BL[1697.997]C[This is the correct direction.]
;W[pq]WL[1717.534]C[Joseki proceeds...]
;B[oq]BL[1686.713]
;W[or]WL[1716.618]
;B[nq]BL[1639.148]
;W[nr]WL[1707.041]
;B[mr]BL[1626.089]LB[op:B][mq:A]C[And here we deviate. For newer players, understand that this hane is bad since it leaves cutting points at A and B. The proper move is to extend at A.]
;W[rp]WL[1704.163]
;B[ro]BL[1619.024]
;W[rq]WL[1701.659]
;B[qn]BL[1608.679]
;W[pj]WL[1616.255]C[As I discussed earlier, I went ahead and took sente to start negating Black's wall.]
;B[pi]BL[1596.307]
;W[oj]WL[1587.356]
;B[qe]BL[1531.098]LB[ol:A]C[I thought this was a little passive of Black to back off. I was expecting an attack of sorts from the A area.]
;W[om]WL[1491.155]LB[op:B][mq:A]C[Since Black didn't attack, I was happy to negate the wall and prepare to utilize the aji left behind at A or B.]
;B[ns]BL[1521.818]
;W[ps]WL[1434.821]
;B[pl]BL[1487.755]
;W[ol]WL[1391.742]C[Try to keep my stones connected.]
;B[pk]BL[1463.597]
;W[ok]WL[1385.125]
;B[qj]BL[1454.538]
;W[op]WL[1372.561]C[And now I decide that I'm strong enough to cut.]
;B[mq]BL[1444.797]
;W[oo]WL[1365.173]
;B[pn]BL[1435.364]
;W[po]WL[1358.277]LB[on:A]C[This was a dubious move. It would have probably been better to simply connect at A.]
;B[on]BL[1420.239]C[Black correctly ignores the atari.]
;W[nn]WL[1343.738]C[I decide to seal him in, but I do this rather impulsively and fail to recognize the problem.]
;B[qo]BL[1402.542]
;W[mo]WL[1320.628]C[I end in gote.]
;B[mp]BL[1387.612]
;W[no]WL[1315.543]C[And then got bad shape as a result. Tsk tsk tsk on me...]
;B[lo]BL[1375.063]
;W[dn]WL[1264.757]C[I decide that now is the time to return to the lower left.]
;B[dq]BL[1334.775]
;W[cq]WL[1244.356]C[When attach, hane!]
;B[ep]BL[1324.947]
;W[do]WL[1213.033]C[Connect solidly.]
;B[iq]BL[1306.374]LB[cr:A]C[This attachment surprised me, I was expecting a hane at A.]
;W[dj]WL[1181.704]C[I decided it was a light stone and still had plenty of use for later, so I decide to take a big point.]
;B[hp]BL[1293.545]
;W[pb]WL[1134.849]C[My opponent complimented me on this move during the game. For those curious why I play here, it is a probe to discover Black's intentions.]
;B[qb]BL[1274.281]C[This hane tells White that Black wants to keep his corner.]
;W[oc]WL[1051.186]
;B[pd]BL[1248.367]
;W[kc]WL[990.159]LB[kd:A]C[Now White makes light shape while making his left moyo grander. Though I might have to say that a move at A might have been better.]
;B[cf]BL[1225.13]
;W[ce]WL[983.835]C[White is happy to see Black jump in and happily kicks!]
;B[df]BL[1218.167]
;W[ch]WL[968.629]LB[gc:A]C[Since I already have the A stone, I go ahead and take away Black's base immediately.]
;B[dl]BL[1208.689]C[This tenuki was surprising, since it creates a second weak group.]
;W[cl]WL[955.949]C[I play under to connect.]
;B[cm]BL[1202.693]
;W[dm]WL[931.376]
;B[ck]BL[1199.119]
;W[bl]WL[929.348]
;B[dk]BL[1195.714]
;W[bk]WL[869.971]
;B[cj]BL[1174.894]C[But I fail miserably. Haha. ]
;W[di]WL[816.361]C[So now my goal is to simply try and keep the groups split.]
;B[bj]BL[1151.786]
;W[bm]WL[748.537]
;B[bh]BL[1140.022]
;W[bf]WL[734.452]LB[cc:A]C[Threatening to cut the groups apart while protecting the corner and removing the 3-3 invasion at A as a possibiliy for Black.]
;B[bg]BL[1133.169]
;W[be]WL[732.138]
;B[cg]BL[1122.543]
;W[fj]WL[712.636]
;B[ic]BL[1111.198]C[And then he goes ahead and creates another weak group.]
;W[he]WL[601.813]C[So I'm happy to attack it.]
;B[hd]BL[1100.704]
;W[gd]WL[593.068]
;B[ie]BL[1097.437]
;W[hf]WL[565.718]
;B[mc]BL[1079.076]C[And then does it again.]
;W[jd]WL[534.737]
;B[id]BL[1065.08]
;W[kf]WL[532.109]C[So now I've made shape and should be able to kill something for sure.]
;B[kb]BL[1057.868]C[When choosing my next hane, I had the following sequence read out.]
;W[lb]WL[471.338]
;B[lc]BL[1050.325]
;W[jb]WL[466.93]
;B[kd]BL[1031.968]
;W[jc]WL[459.734]
;B[je]BL[1024.398]
;W[ke]WL[447.769]C[Key move here is to cut since I am keeping the groups separated.]
;B[ld]BL[1012.474]
;W[ib]WL[433.285]TR[ic][hd][id][ie][je]C[And now the marked group is captured.]
;B[mb]BL[995.589]C[Black thinks that this is sente, but I don't need to respond to this.]
;W[fl]WL[375.493]C[So I prepare to kill the group on the left.]
;B[dh]BL[986.453]
;W[ci]WL[371.156]
;B[eh]BL[980.892]
;W[fi]WL[358.75]
;B[ge]BL[968.817]
;W[gg]WL[314.147]C[I decide to play solidly here in order to avoid any easy cutting points.]
;B[fh]BL[945.145]
;W[hi]WL[280.118]C[And then I try to make shape while continuing to seal Black in.]
;B[gh]BL[941.316]
;W[hh]WL[275.858]
;B[gf]BL[937.227]
;W[hg]WL[254.716]C[Again, the goal was to play solid and squeeze him to death.]
;B[ed]BL[931.356]
;W[de]WL[207.043]C[This move was an attempt to prevent Black from pushing up at and making eyes. Though in actuality, it's a pretty bad move.]
;B[ee]BL[919.059]
;W[fg]WL[192.317]
;B[ef]BL[914.26]
;W[dc]WL[149.255]C[My corner is now getting kind of weak, so I strengthen it.]
;B[ec]BL[900.906]
;W[eb]WL[122.898]C[I hane since I believe I should have no issues if Black cuts at D18.]
;B[fb]BL[895.288]C[However, now this is a forcing move.]
;W[db]WL[107.541]C[White must connect unless he wants to start some sort of capturing race, which I was pretty sure I would lose.]
;B[hb]BL[883.645]C[BAM. Magic tesuji. I did not see this one coming.]
;W[ka]WL[21.204]
;B[gb]BL[877.452]TR[ka][ib][jb][lb][jc][kc][jd]C[So now I have two choices. Make life for my white group or die trying ot start a semeai.]
;W[ff]WL[5.037]
;B[fe]BL[873.221]C[After my one forcing move, I realize that I must make life.]
;W[ia]WL[30]OW[3]
;B[eg]BL[866.762]C[And sadly Black lives, but to his credit, the tesuji at H18 was well spotted. So a job well done to Black.]
;W[dr]WL[30]OW[3]C[At this point I still think that I might be ahead in terms of points, but the reality is that the gap is much closer now.]
;B[hl]BL[851.296]C[This was a nice by Black since is wipes out a lot of White's center territory. ]
;W[fn]WL[30]OW[3]LB[hn:A]C[Threaten to cut at A.]
;B[gk]BL[843.64]
;W[fk]WL[30]OW[3]
;B[ll]BL[835.665]C[More reduction...]
;W[lj]WL[30]OW[2]LB[kf:3][hg:2][ok:1]C[At this point, it is now White with the weak groups and must be careful of not dying.]
;B[mk]BL[829.535]
;W[mj]WL[30]OW[2]
;B[hn]BL[812.849]
;W[oi]WL[30]OW[2]LB[of:A]C[This is probably my losing move. It was made impulsively, and would be much better played at A.]
;B[oh]BL[806.838]C[Now Black gets to solidify and grow his right side even more.]
;W[nh]WL[30]OW[2]
;B[ng]BL[803.574]
;W[ph]WL[30]OW[2]C[Here is my attempt at planting aji.]

;B[nl]BL[780.642]
;W[ml]WL[30]OW[2]LB[lk:B][nk:A]C[White cannot connect at A since Black will capture the entire with an atari at B.]

;B[rm]BL[749.721]C[But no luck.]
;W[so]WL[30]OW[2]C[So I obligingly pull back.]

I hope this game review was helpful!])
