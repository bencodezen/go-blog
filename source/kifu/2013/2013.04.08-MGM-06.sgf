(;B[lc]BL[1774.728]LB[pf:A]C[Although this seems like a common sense move, since you are establishing a base while pincering the stone, the isn't a really severe follow-up and Black generally ends up rather overconcentrated. Credit to Moboy78 for showing me this. See Move 7 for the variation.]

;B[op]BL[1624.526]LB[dj:A]C[This seems to be wrong direction for Black. Both players have the marked komoku's that are facing the same side. So in actuality, a move like A would probably be better suited as a global strategy.]
