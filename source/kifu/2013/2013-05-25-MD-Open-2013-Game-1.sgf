;W[cd]
;B[ed]C[Here I was expecting an attach and extend joseki.]
;W[gc]C[Guess not... With that being said, I realized how helpless I felt as I realized I normally look at Eidogo when encountered with this pincer. Sigh. Time to try and be creative!]
;B[cc]C[When I chose to attach here, I was expecting a cut of some sort and then an ensuing battle.]
;W[bc]
;B[dc]C[Although pulling back here is probably not the best since G17 is already pincering the group, I was hoping to gain thickness to attack the G17 stone. UPDATE: Apparently this is the joseki move, who would've thunk it!]
;W[bb]C[I was happy to see him descend because....]
;B[ce]C[I had no intentions of making a base there and was happy to get some outside thickness.]
;W[be]
;B[cf]
;W[bf]
;B[jc]LB[cg:A]C[Although proper play is to extend to A, I thought that it would allow White an opportunity to settle his G17 stone which would inadvertently bring my group under attack. As a reslt, I chose to pincer instead.]
;W[ge]LB[hd:A][ie:B][je:C]TR[cc][dc][ed][ce][cf]C[Although some players would consider playing A, B or C in an effort to chase the group, it is important to remember that any chasing will end up with Black's group getting much weaker.]
;B[ff]C[So I attack from this side instead.]
;W[qo]LB[je:A]C[I was a little shocked at the tenuki, but I decided I would try and get sente to come back and attack the group. UPDATE: This move is not sente and I should have instead punished White for tenuki by playing A.]
;B[op]
;W[ql]
;B[gf]
;W[id]
;B[jd]
;W[ie]
;B[kf]
;W[ig]LB[jh:2][gi:1]C[Which direction would you attack from?]
;B[gi]C[I believe this to be the correct direction since Black's weak group is far from alive.]
;W[ii]C[At this point, do you continue attacking or tenuki?]
;B[fq]C[Since the group was already out in the center, I did not want to strengthen White any further and chose to approach instead.]
;W[dq]C[Very solid response.]
;B[jp]C[This move develops fast but vulnerable to invasions.]
;W[lp]C[The question here is: How to respond? I'd like to attack the M4 stone, but what's the best route in doing so.]
;B[pn]C[Leaning attack! ]
;W[qn]
;B[pl]
;W[qk]C[Once Black has forced White with those two moves, it's time to return back to the attack.]
;B[ko]TR[pl][pn][ko][jp][op][pq]C[Now White is surrounded by Black influence.]
;W[jq]
;B[iq]LB[ip:A]C[Before I chose to hane here, I made sure that I would be able to manage if White cut at A.]
;W[kq]
;B[mq]C[Remove White's base while securing my own.]
;W[mn]
;B[on]C[The goal of this move was to prevent White from linking up with this group on the right.]
;W[mp]
;B[nq]
;W[ip]TR[mn]C[Unfortunately, my prior reading was no longer relevant since White now has the marked stone in place.]
;B[fo]C[In order to play light, I jump out in hopes of developing the left side a bit.]
;W[cn]C[I was surprised when White responded here, but this was the perfect opportunity for me to reconcile my mistake in the K4 area.]
;B[io]TR[gc][id][ge][ie][ig][ii]C[When I atari'd here, I was expecting to lose J3 in the exchange for some thickness to possibly attack the J16 group.]
;W[ir]C[When White atari'd under, I was ecstatic.  Thickness and stability. Sweet!]
;B[hq]
;W[ln]LB[rq:A]TR[pl][on][pn][op][mq][nq][pq]C[At this point, I would like to attack White's M4 group, but in case you didn't realize, my marked group is not that strong and could come under attack.]
;B[rp]C[So I decide to play a forcing sequence to give my group a better base before launching my attack.]
;W[qp]
;B[qq]
;W[ro]C[Now that I'm stronger...]
;B[kk]LB[ie:1][mn:2]C[This is probably my prized move of the entire game. L9 was the move I deemed proper to split both groups at the same time which would most likely allow me to capture one as a result.]
;W[mk]C[Now begins the struggle!]
;B[ki]
;W[ik]
;B[gk]
;W[kh]
;B[jh]
;W[jf]
;B[jg]
;W[je]LB[qc:A][qh:B]C[White probably thought it was sente since Black might want to try and keep the upper right corner, but you have to remember that the 3-3 is still available to White and the B area is already negated by White's stone at R9.]
;B[hf]C[So I choose to threaten to cut instead.]
;W[ke]
;B[if]
;W[kg]
;B[ji]
;W[lf]
;B[md]TR[jc][jd][md][pd]C[My goal with this move was to make sure I lived and stayed connected. From my analysis of the game, if I could manage that, I would win.]
;W[ld]
;B[lc]
;W[mc]
;B[nc]
;W[kc]
;B[mb]
;W[lb]
;B[kd]LB[mc:A][qg:B]C[Ko! UPDATE: I should've just connected A and then taken a corner enclosure at B to ensure a solid lead. It doesn't matter if all of White's groups live since he has barely any points.]
;W[mc]
;B[rm]
;W[qm]
;B[lc]
;W[qc]C[Some might feel compelled to respond, but to me, I wasn't planning on keeping the corner anyways.]
;B[le]
;W[qd]
;B[mi]C[Another splitting move!]

;B[pj]
;W[lh]
;B[li]
;W[mh]C[At this point, it is important not to be discouraged that White will most likely live. Because...]
;B[lr]TR[mk][ln][mn][lp][mp][jq][kq][ir]C[This entire group has yet to make one eye yet.]
;W[hr]C[After some reading...]
;B[kr]C[I figured out that this was sente and didn't jepordize my other group.]
;W[gq]
;B[hp]
;W[jr]
;B[gr]
;W[nj]
;B[ni]
;W[pm]
;B[om]
;W[ol]TR[pl]C[Moment of truth: Is the marked stone important?]
(;B[nl]C[Nope. Not one bit.]
;W[ok]
;B[nk]
;W[pk]
;B[mj]
;W[ch]C[At this point, I was pretty sure I was ahead, so now it was time to practice my endgame!]
;B[pb]C[Forcing move, but goal is to keep sente.]
;W[qb]
;B[rf]C[Again, same concept.]
;W[re]
;B[di]C[Shoulder hit to reduce him while also expanding my own.]

;W[ef]C[When my opponent played here, I was only focused on the two stones, which I was happy to sacrifice.]
;B[bm]
;W[fe]C[Except I forgot that I needed to connect.... Crap.... Now White has a big corner.....]
;B[eg]
;W[df]
;B[cr]C[And now I try a last ditch effort to get compensation.]
;W[dr]
;B[bo]
;W[bn]LB[an:A]C[Although I can connect safely at A, I'm feeling a little vindictive since I want to get back the corner I lost.]
;B[bp]C[I choose to try and live (which would inadvertently kill White).]
;W[an]
;B[ar]LB[bq:A]C[Here I go for a shape move, but later on we find out that a White play at A would kill the group.]
(;W[bs]C[Unfortunately for my opponent, he chooses the most obvious eye to poke out.]
;B[cs]C[And since my life and death is pretty decent...]
