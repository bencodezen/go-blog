;B[pd]BL[2687.178]
;W[dc]WL[2673.401]C[Selecting the 3-4 where the strong side faces the star stone.]
;B[qp]BL[2676.641]
;W[dq]WL[2604.105]C[This move was accidental. Believe it or not, for some reason I thought Black played on the star point again, so I chose this 3-4. ]
;B[oq]BL[2651.218]
;W[qj]WL[2443.629]LB[qf:A]C[This splits the right side, but today's professionals are starting to approach with A more.]
;B[ce]BL[2625.854]
;W[qf]WL[2368.02]C[This may have been slightly premature in regards to selecting a direction, but my rationale at the time was that I wanted to get my ideal extension instead of letting Black choose the flow of the game.]
;B[nc]BL[2581.716]
;W[de]WL[2225.285]C[This contact play is a poor choice. If White had some potential on the top, it would make more sense, but in this case it's pretty awful.]
;B[df]BL[2560.302]
;W[ee]WL[2207.311]
;B[cd]BL[2556.344]
;W[cc]WL[2203.553]
;B[ci]BL[2532.046]
;W[gc]WL[2131.587]LB[jc:A]C[This is slow. Generally the extension is to A, but I thought it left me kind of thin.]
;B[co]BL[2469]
;W[dl]WL[2078.798]C[Here I choose the high pincer because I want to avoid giving Black any extra synergy between his stones.]
;B[bq]BL[2435.732]
;W[do]WL[2062.997]C[Since Black chose to dive, I decide to try and make a wall.]
;B[cr]BL[2405.927]
;W[cn]WL[2052.751]C[Since Black chooses to gain safety in the corner, I wanted to seal him in.]
;B[bo]BL[2360.93]
;W[cp]WL[1863.781]C[Since Black seems committed to the corner, I wanted to force him to defend while strenthening my shape.]
;B[bp]BL[2340.294]
;W[jp]WL[1807.557]C[Big extension.]
;B[ql]BL[2324.856]C[Checking extension.]
;W[of]WL[1776.421]C[Decided to jump on this side since P10 might induce P8 which is good for Black.]
;B[ok]BL[2257.447]C[Nice leaning attack by Black.]
;W[jc]WL[1554.267]C[I choose to ignore since I want to target the corner.]

;W[oj]WL[1482.549]
;B[nk]BL[2102.919]
;W[nj]WL[1469.426]C[I pushed here anticipating the hane at N10.]
;B[mj]BL[2091.315]C[Because I had the following sequence planned...]
;W[pk]WL[1459.988]
;B[pl]BL[2086.357]

;W[nh]WL[1417.547]
;B[dn]BL[1944.055]
;W[ji]WL[1278.576]C[I decide that Black's cut is too small in terms of the whole board and decide to take the initiative in the fight.]
;B[eo]BL[1909.465]
;W[cf]WL[1189.318]C[Here is probably my proudest moment in the game. I try to turn a mistake into something advantageous for the future fight.]

;W[dd]WL[1165.513]C[Solidify shape while atari'ing the stones.]
;B[af]BL[1891.899]C[I now gained solid thickness that will be good for developing the center/top.]
;W[md]WL[1129.034]C[This was a bit of wishful thinking on my part, but I guess I thought I would be able to attack/kill the N11 group.]
