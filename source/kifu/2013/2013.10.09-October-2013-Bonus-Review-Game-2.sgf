;B[pd]BL[2683.429]
;W[dc]WL[2696.386]C[3-4 komoku with the strong side facing the star point.]
;B[pq]BL[2673.217]
;W[cp]WL[2692.761]C[3-4 komoku with the weak side exposed in preparation to counter the Chinese opening.]
;B[ep]BL[2653.07]C[Black's approach here is natural since is works well with the strong side of his lower right's 3-4 komoku.]
;W[po]WL[2688.602]C[As some of you might have noticed, I have been experimenting with this tenuki approach response in order to prevent Black from getting an advantageous position early in the game.]
;B[qo]BL[2634.483]LB[qn:A]C[Most common joseki response is at A, but I feel that giving Black sente to respond in the lower left corner is not good for White.]
;W[pp]WL[2674.988]C[So the descent attempts to disrupt Black's plan.]
;B[qp]BL[2611.42]
;W[oq]WL[2671.782]C[Hane to block and threaten to start a fight.]
;B[qq]BL[2600.791]C[Solid connection here signals Black's desire to simply maintain a solid positon and not get into any complicated fighting.]
;W[pn]WL[2643.896]C[White extends once here to prevent Black from playing the hane at the head of his stones since it will cause problems later on.]
;B[qm]BL[2588.081]C[Black jumps here to prevent from being sealed in. A nice move.]
;W[hp]WL[2604.43]LB[np:A][or:B]C[Though White would like to descend at A or B to make his thickness more impressive, I did not think it would be sente and decided to instead take the initiative with the lower left corner.]
;B[en]BL[2532.64]C[This one space jump is a calm way to respond.]
;W[cn]WL[2556.646]LB[cm:A]C[Thie is the correct direction to jump since White is (1) making some territory, (2) establishing a base for himself, (3) putting pressure on Black, and (4) preventing Black from easily sealing him in. 

Also, please note that the two space extension at A is possible as well, but it is rather thin and I was not planning on showing any weakness this early in the game.]
;B[el]BL[2484.429]LB[cl:A]C[Black's jump here is natural as well. At this point, most players would probably consider continuing at A as White.]
;W[kp]WL[2508.542]LB[cl:A]TR[hp]C[I decided that jumping at A was no longer putting enough pressure on Black and would allow him to come back and pincer the marked H4 stone and render my thickness at Q4 useless. So I decide on this 4th line two space extension instead (which is also a joseki choice).]
;B[cq]BL[2348.018]LB[cl:A]TR[cn][cp]C[Black's attachment here states a few things. (1) He wants to attack the marked White group. (2) He wants to take away th corner from White. But remember that this is the opening, which is why the joseki move is normally at A since that will seal White in.]
;W[cl]WL[2482.537]LB[bq:A]C[While many kyu players might feel compelled to hane at A and try to make life, it is way too small to fight over th corner at this stage in the game. There are still many big points on the board and since Black did not seal White in, White should take the opportunity to simply expand his base.]
;B[de]BL[2298.101]C[Black decides to approach the upper left corner.]
;W[dh]WL[2457.201]TR[dh][cl]C[I decide on the two space pincer again because I thought there would be decent synergy between the marked stones while preventing any easy for the E4 group later on.]
;B[gd]BL[2223.877]C[Black decides to follow the most popular variation for the two space pincer joseki.]
;W[ee]WL[2409.769]C[White threatens to cut.]
;B[ef]BL[2203.387]C[Black hane's here to keep White's group split.]
;W[fe]WL[2407.105]LB[ed:A]C[White cannot submissively retreat at A, and must extend to continue splitting Black's groups.]
;B[dd]BL[2191.336]C[Black is now threatening to separate White's groups.]
;W[fc]WL[2402.402]C[This is the proper shape for White to maintain connection.]
;B[cc]BL[2170.229]C[Black hane's to establish a base for himself.]
;W[ec]WL[2397.204]C[White protects the connection with good shape.]
;B[ff]BL[2160.546]C[Black pushes once for some influence.]
;W[ge]WL[2391.084]C[White cannot let Black seal him in and must extend.]
;B[bd]BL[2138.582]C[Black secures his group by making a tiger's mouth.]
;W[kc]WL[2367.838]C[And White ends the joseki by making an extension here. ]
;B[dj]BL[2103.861]TR[dh]C[Black now tries to use his thickness to cut separate the marked D4 stone and make some territory.]
;W[cj]WL[2349.571]C[But White is prepared to fight back.]
;B[ci]BL[2090.884]C[Black hane's to continue his plan.]
;W[di]WL[2342.959]C[White must cut.]
;B[bj]BL[2074.126]C[Atari.]
;W[ck]WL[2329.555]C[Connect.]
;B[ch]BL[2069.269]TR[dh][di]C[Extend while putting pressure on the marked White stones.]
;W[ej]WL[2291.256]C[Normally atari's are bad since they strengthen your opponent, but since my group is at a disadvantage at this point, I needed to create some aji for me to either escape or live.]
;B[dk]BL[2061.867]
;W[cg]WL[2267.209]C[White's hane here is to create more aji.]
;B[dg]BL[2013.546]C[Black's cut here is aggressive, but unfortunately he has fallen into White's trap.]
;W[bg]WL[2241.643]TR[ej]C[With the marked stone in place, Black can no longer capture the D12 stones in a ladder.]
;B[eh]BL[1980.481]
;W[ei]WL[2237.707]
;B[bi]BL[1960.288]
;W[bk]WL[2218.013]TR[ch][bi][ci][bj]C[As you can see here, Black's marked stones are stuck at three liberties while the surrounding White groups have enough liberties to win the race.]
;B[fi]BL[1887.628]LB[fh:A]TR[dh][di][ei][ej]C[Black tries to win the race since it seems that the marked White group is behind in liberties, but the weakness at A is why White will not lose the capturing race. ]
;W[fj]WL[2214.855]LB[fh:A]C[Though White could have atari'd at A, I find that it's always better to escape when you have the chance to.]
;B[gi]BL[1882.471]
;W[gj]WL[2204.252]
;B[hj]BL[1824.194]LB[fh:A]C[Aggressive hane by Black when you consider the cutting point at A.]
;W[gl]WL[2173.13]C[The one point jump is the proper haengma (i.e., stone movement) to escape.]
;B[gm]BL[1801.606]C[Black responsds aggressively while strengthening his own group. ]
;W[hl]WL[2120.948]LB[fl:A]C[This extension is a mistake. It leaves a weakness that Black promptly takes advantage of next. White should have played at A instead.]
;B[fl]BL[1742.286]C[Black promptly takes the shape point to White's dismay.]
;W[gk]WL[2102.24]C[And White must connect in bad shape to prevent from being sealed in.]
;B[in]BL[1715.332]C[Black tries to keep up an attack here, but White is out in the center now with plenty of liberties now, so the attack is not very effective. It is important to note, however, that the J6 does pose a threat to White's bottom formation.]
;W[hi]WL[2090.449]LB[nc:A][ke:D][kn:B][fq:C]C[For someone reason I decide to take advantage of the cutting points now, but I think this is very small. Any of the other areas I marked would be worth a lot more. Another example of me being stuck in kyu tunnel vision.... Sigh.]
;B[hh]BL[1707.897]
;W[fh]WL[2075.597]C[Again, too caught up in being able to double atari.]
;B[ii]BL[1689.383]
;W[eg]WL[2071.321]
;B[df]BL[1676.857]C[Black connects properly.]
;W[gh]WL[2063.097]C[And then White goes on to play the worst move the entire game. This is absolutely.... most indefinitely.... 100% positively not sente. And Black should ignore this move.]
;B[hi]BL[1620.723]C[White is very lucky that Black responds, but this allows White to take initiative in the game again.]
;W[fq]WL[2051.041]C[So White expands his bottom territory while attacking Black's base.]
;B[jl]BL[1540.241]C[Black tries to escape out into the center, but remember, "Knight's move is for attacking. One space jump is for escaping."]
;W[hm]WL[2030.76]C[And then there's this weakness as well.]
;B[hn]BL[1523.039]
;W[gn]WL[2028.318]
;B[go]BL[1485.611]
;W[fm]WL[2023.89]
;B[fn]BL[1476.283]
;W[ho]WL[2008.919]C[True. It's a ko, but a picnic ko for White.]
;B[gp]BL[1470.195]C[I'm surprised when Black decides to simply fight back without the ko.]
;W[gq]WL[2000.992]
;B[hq]BL[1458.39]
;W[iq]WL[1981.019]
;B[hr]BL[1453.647]
;W[jp]WL[1974.328]LB[jo:A][ip:B][ir:C]TR[fq][gq]C[Though this connection gives Black the forcing move at A (which threatens the snapback at B), I chose this connection for one primary reason. (1) Black cannot push as C and then win the capturing race against White's F3 stones. ]
;B[eq]BL[1427.998]
;W[ir]WL[1962.397]LB[fr:A]C[Black's next move should be at A since it would be sente.]
;B[dp]BL[1414.503]C[Black plays here to give himself more eye potential.]
;W[bp]WL[1933.856]C[White naturally wants to protect his left group.]
;B[fp]BL[1388.887]
;W[gr]WL[1917.638]LB[fr:A]C[Black should force once more with A here.]
;B[gm]BL[1363.01]C[Black finally takes the ko.]
;W[pr]WL[1888.34]C[I don't realy have a ko threat, so I decide that it's best to just seal up my bottom territory.]
;B[qr]BL[1355.896]
;W[or]WL[1882.174]
;B[em]BL[1338.475]C[And then Black finishes the ko, but White is glad to have sente in exchange.]
;W[nc]WL[1846.269]
;B[pf]BL[1314.388]
;W[pb]WL[1812.648]
;B[qc]BL[1307.203]LB[pj:A]C[Instead of protecting the corner, Black should consider a move like A since it will give him maximum opportunity for growth on the right side while posisbly forming center territory.]
;W[qh]WL[1805.195]LB[oh:A][qk:B]C[White takes advantage of Black's weak side by approaching here. there is a miai of settling at B or running lightly with A.]
;B[qj]BL[1302.246]C[The pincer is a natural response.]
;W[oh]WL[1797.838]C[White jumps to escape.]
;B[nf]BL[1293.417]LB[qe:A]TR[oh][qh]C[Black correctly strengthens the correct group while attacking the marked White stones, but this still leaves weakness in the A area.]
;W[me]WL[1743.962]C[White decides that it's better to grow the top at the moment since he should beable to reduce Black's center potential while maintaing his lead.]
;B[oj]BL[1258.907]C[Black continues his attack on the R12 group, which shows good whole board analysis.]
;W[rf]WL[1721.994]C[I decide to slide and see what kind of base I could possibly establish before sacrificing parts of the group.]
;B[re]BL[1249.127]
;W[qf]WL[1714.9]C[Now White is poking at Black's thin connections.]
;B[qe]BL[1245.779]
;W[pg]WL[1712.367]LB[of:A][pi:B]C[White makes shape and threatens to cut at A or start making living shape with a move like B.]
;B[rg]BL[1235.343]C[Black's stone cannot be capture here and is a nice eye stealing tesuji, but White does not need to live to make this invasion/reduction successful.]
;W[of]WL[1707.701]C[White utilizes this forcing move to see what black wants to do.]
;B[pe]BL[1229.688]LB[oe:A]C[Though it would be very risky ko for Black, Black should play the ko at A out since he is behind.]
;W[oe]WL[1705.103]C[So White easily connects and Black's right side has been severely reduced.]
;B[qg]BL[1224.1]C[This move secures his corner group.]
;W[rh]WL[1701.331]C[But it is done so in gote and White gets an additional forcing move for future endgame moves.]
;B[sf]BL[1220.878]
;W[od]WL[1699.193]C[White completes his connection.]
;B[ng]BL[1210.671]LB[og:A]C[Black extends and threatens to cut at A.]
;W[og]WL[1686.876]C[Connects.]
;B[lg]BL[1206.434]C[Black is now trying to escape.]
;W[kf]WL[1655.419]C[And White is happy to let him do os while solidifying the top.]
;B[ne]BL[1189.349]LB[nd:A]C[You might feel compelled to connect at A, but it's bad shape.]
;W[md]WL[1648.936]C[Simples and doesn't give Black any easy forcing moves.]
;B[nd]BL[1180.525]LB[mc:A][oc:B]C[Though this threatens th doulbe cut at A and B, neither one really work in Black's favor and this removes a liberty from Black. Black should instead escape into the center before trying this out.]
;W[mi]WL[1609.245]C[I play here to start surrounding Black's group, and I have a tesuji in mind if Black tries to cut me off. Can you guess what I have planned for Black?]
;B[nh]BL[1116.03]C[Black tries to cut off my stone.]
;W[ni]WL[1606.019]C[Threaten to connect.]
;B[oi]BL[1105.396]LB[mc:A][oc:B]C[Black cuts here aiming to double cut at A and B to reclaim the right side, except a shape has appeared that many of you have probably already recognized.]
;W[mg]WL[1603.405]C[Crane nest tesuji!]
;B[mh]BL[1089.353]C[Black tries to escape.]
;W[lh]WL[1601.196]C[But it is futile, see variation if you can't read out the rest.]
(;B[fg]BL[1015.483]C[Black tries to atari in sente.]
;W[gg]WL[1583.321]C[But once again, White refuses to be sealed in.]
;B[gf]BL[990.648]LB[hg:A]C[Though White can push at A, I decide that solidifying the top is better.]
;W[he]WL[1575.854]
;B[hg]BL[957.983]LB[eh:A]C[Though many kyu players might feel compelled to connect since this capture at A would be worth 8 points, it would be in gote and I felt there were bigger moves on the board to be played.]
;W[kn]WL[1551.482]C[LIke this for example, White's territory on the bottom is getting bigger!]
;B[im]BL[907.722]

;B[rm]BL[870.098]
;W[pm]WL[1513.378]C[Once again though, I decide that it's better to simply grow the bottom instead of taking gote connections.]
