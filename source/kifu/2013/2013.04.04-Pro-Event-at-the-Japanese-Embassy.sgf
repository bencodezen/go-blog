;W[qf]
;B[nd]
;W[qn]C[This double approach seems to be pretty common in handicap games when Black response calmly (aka no pincer) to the first approach.]
;B[qj]C[I thought this would be a good move to split White.]
;W[nq]C[And then another common tactic, switching directions.]
;B[pn]
;W[pm]
;B[on]
;W[qp]
;B[op]LB[qq:A]C[This is the first questionable move. Narumi says that this is playable, but more the more common response is A.]
;W[qq]
;B[pr]C[This is playable as well. The idea is to keep White split.]
;W[ql]LB[qm:A]C[Although this seems a little slow, Narumi says that protecting the cut at A is an urgent move that cannot be ommitted.]
;B[fq]TR[qf]C[I'm not sure if this is a slack move. I feel that it is probably better to take the intitiative in the upper right and attack the marked stone.]
;W[jp]
;B[oj]
;W[nl]
;B[lq]C[This is our first move that receives a big compliment. She considers this a pro move. Puts severe pressure on White while working towards making Black stronger.]
;W[lp]LB[mp:A][kq:B]C[Black to play: A or B.]
(;B[mp]C[And this is where we screwup. In my defense, I thought we would be able to capture O3 without a problem. See move 19 for the proper variation.]
;W[mq]
;B[lr]
;W[kq]
;B[np]
;W[kr]C[I misread the semeai by one liberty. Sigh.]
;B[lo]
;W[kp]C[So now White is very strong (and even has one eye guaranteed), and it is Black who is weak.]
;B[lm]LB[dj:A]C[She complimented us on this move as well, because we recognized that this is an urgent move and we cannot afford to play a big point like A.]
;W[fc]
;B[ic]C[Here we decide to pincer in order to continue with the idea of the one space jump at O16.]
;W[cf]
;B[ee]C[Keep White split.]
;W[cc]
;B[dc]
;W[cd]LB[cb:A][eg:B]C[Okay. So the ironic thing here is that I have been in this situation before, but I forget the proper continuation. Black to play.]
(;B[cb]C[I play here thinking we can get sente when White hanes.]
;W[de]C[I was wrong...]
;B[fd]C[This is another big mistake on our part. It looks like good shape, but if you notice, the F17 stone is on a critical point in Black's shape which will be a headache for Black later on.]
;W[ef]
;B[ff]
;W[eg]LB[cn:A]C[So at this point, I'm thinking. Okay. White has thickness on the left. The ideal White approach would be at A, so let's negate White's influence.]
;B[co]C[Gurujeet chooses a tighter enclosure.]
;W[gd]C[This was a surprise.]
;B[ge]C[Seems like the natural response...]
;W[hd]
(;B[id]LB[eb:B][jd:A]TR[cb][dc][dd][fd][ee][ge][ff]C[Narumi says that our second big mistake is here. EIther A or B would be acceptable responses, but this is really bad since it's very obvious where White will go next and not to mention Black's marked stones are getting weaker as White will run out. ]
;W[he]
;B[hf]
;W[ie]
;B[je]
;W[if]
;B[hg]
;W[ec]C[In my defense, I never realized that this was a BIG BIG BIG problem. See how Black's bad shape is coming back to haunt him? See variations for why it's a problem.]
(;B[hc]C[We thought this was a forcing move.]
;W[ed]C[White has a better forcing move. xD]
;B[fe]
;W[fg]
;B[gf]
;W[gc]
;B[qd]LB[hi:A]TR[fd][ee][fe][ge][ff][gf][hf][hg]C[This is our first instance of playing a bit point instead of an urgent one. After all, since we chose to save those stones earlier, we should continue that idea and jump instead.]
;W[ih]C[At this point, I'm thinking we should sacrifice our dumpling. Gurujeet wants to fight though. So fight on we go.]

;W[hi]
;B[ii]
;W[jh]
;B[gi]
;W[hj]
;B[gh]
;W[gj]C[At this point, we agree that White is going to run us in to the group and we have no hopes of living.]
;B[lf]C[So now our final goal is to conver the entire upper right corner into our territory. ]
;W[ej]
;B[lh]C[The running joke for the rest of the game would be, "Ben. This is our house! Our house!]
;W[qh]C[At this point I'm thinking, if I can't kill this group... Oh man....]
;B[rj]C[Keep White disconnected.]
;W[ni]C[*dies* She picked up on a weak spot in our group in an instant. I immediately realize that "our house" was probably not going to stay "our house" for much longer.]
;B[nj]C[But we fight on!]
;W[mi]TR[lh][mi][nj]C[If you can't recognize it, this is the elephant's eye.]
;B[kj]C[Knight's move in response!]
;W[mj]
;B[mk]C[We have no choice but to cut.]
;W[nk]TR[nj][oj][qj][rj]C[Now our marked stones are dying. Nooooo.....]
;B[oh]
;W[mg]
;B[jf]C[We think that this is a forcing move to save our big dumpling.]
;W[lg]C[But White's plan is better.]
;B[kg]
;W[kh]

;W[pk]LB[si:A][rl:B]C[The game ends here, but if my reading is correct, Black should be able to live if he plays A. B is questionable, but possible.])
