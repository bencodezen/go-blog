;B[ck]C[When my opponent finished the Chinese opening, I couldn't help but laugh as I thought, "Hello old friend! It seems we are at odds with one another this game. Let us see if he can use you better than I can!"]
;W[jp]LB[mq:A][nq:B]C[When I have ninrensei (two star points), I prefer the corner enclosure to negate Black's influence, but since I had chosen a 3-4 and star point opening, I decided to go with a faster development.]
;B[pe]
;W[qe]C[I decided to chooes the attach joseki since I wanted to play a try for a territorial game.]
;B[qf]
;W[qd]
;B[pf]
;W[nc]LB[pj:A][qm:B]C[At this point, I'm expecting Black to extend to A and then respond at B to prevent Black from getting an ideal approach move.]
;B[qn]LB[pj:A]C[Black must have saw that too, so he tries to approach here first in hopes of getting an extension at A.]
;W[qk]LB[qh:B][on:A]TR[pe][pf][qf]C[No way I was letting that happen! I chose the low two space pincer since if Black responded on the bottom, I would settle at B and begin an attack on the marked group.]
;B[qi]C[Black chose safety, but here's the thing to remember, Black's move is already inefficient, so White is already happy.]
;W[ok]

;B[rr]
;W[or]
;B[nj]C[Unfortunately, the tables have turned and I am now coming under attack.]
;W[nk]LB[rh:A]C[I connect with the knowledge that I am heavy in hopes of keep the groups split and possibly attacking the group at A later on. In all honesty though, this is wishful thinking and should not work out in my favor.]
;B[jc]
;W[cc]C[With the double enclosure, I felt I had no choice but to quickly settle at 3-3.]

;W[je]C[With sente, I figured that I could negate most of Black's influence with a simple capping move.]
;B[kd]
;W[ke]
;B[md]
;W[kh]C[Make some shape.]
;B[le]
;W[mi]C[Connect my two weak groups so I have less to worry about later.]
;B[nf]
;W[hh]LB[kf:A]C[I played here for fast shape but also to protect the cut at A.]
(;B[gf]
;W[fq]C[I decide to try and develop the bottom since Black looks over concentrated at the top anyhow.]
;B[do]
;W[fo]C[Honte move.]
;B[jq]C[I was surprised by this attachment, but not quite worried.]
;W[iq]
;B[kq]
;W[ip]
;B[kp]LB[ko:A]C[At this point, normal move seems to be at A, but I decide I want to own the entire bottom.]
;W[mm]C[Epic cut!]
;B[lm]
;W[ml]
;B[kn]C[So now Black must try to live in White's influence.]
;W[lo]
;B[ko]LB[mo:A]C[Since connecting back at A is gote and allows White to run into more space...]
;W[im]C[I chose to cut White off first.]
;B[jm]C[With this attachment, I make a big mistake.]
;W[jl]LB[il:B][in:A]C[I decide to hane instead of descend calmly at A. In my defense I was expecting a cut at B.]

;W[hn]
;B[il]
;W[hm]

;W[jk]
;B[mo]C[Now Black is uber alive....]
;W[lq]C[I refuse to accept it and try a half-baked move.]
;B[lp]
;W[ll]C[Trying to make something happen...]
;B[mq]C[Nope... Black is now super alive...]
;W[ql]C[I'm feeling crummy about my failed capture attempt, so I decide to see if Black will ignore this move.]
;B[qm]C[No luck and not to mention one less ko threat...]
;W[sl]
;B[rs]C[Black is alive here now too....]
;W[ir]LB[cm:B][cp:C][lr:A]C[As my final ditch attempt, I read out a rather complicated killing sequence, knowing that Black would most likely capture at A which would force me to try for shenanigans at B and C.]
;B[dm]C[When Black plays here, I nearly fall out of my chair since this is the mistake that would let me easily seal the game! So, White to play: Kill Black.]
(;W[mr]C[This is the move to kill Black, which is the one sequence my opponent didn't consider.]

;B[ms]
;W[lq]
;B[js]
;W[ns]LB[ls:A]C[Black cannot connect due to shortage of liberties.]
;B[mq]C[No ko fight because....]
;W[ls]C[That settles it.]
;B[kk]
;W[jj]
;B[fh]C[At this point, my goal is not to let Black accidentally live.]
