;B[pd]BL[1198.075]
;W[pp]WL[1184.754]
;B[eq]BL[1193.498]C[Once again, I astound myself in that I chose a cross-fuseki and a 5-3 point as well. ]
;W[dc]WL[1178.198]
;B[cp]BL[1191.704]C[Being that this is a cross-fuseki, the corner enclosure is a normal idea since cross-fuseki games usually end up being territorial instead of moyo based.]
;W[qf]WL[1175.854]
;B[nc]BL[1189.253]C[Nice and calm respopnse.]
;W[rd]WL[1173.045]
;B[qc]BL[1186.135]
;W[rc]WL[1169.67]
;B[rb]BL[1183.031]LB[kc:A][ce:B]C[This move is okay for defending the corner, but it would probably be better to go ahead and extend at A instead since it would further counter any power White might get from a corner enclosure at B.]
;W[sb]WL[1167.432]
;B[qb]BL[1179.884]C[This is an obligatory move since Black chose to defend the corner.]
;W[of]WL[1147.341]
;B[qi]BL[1166.753]C[This invasion is based on the idea that White did not take his base yet. ]
;W[oi]WL[1141.326]
;B[ql]BL[1163.865]C[Calmly extend and take a base.]
;W[pj]WL[1138.344]
;B[qj]BL[1160.16]
;W[qn]WL[1110.532]
;B[pk]BL[1146.429]C[Threaten to come out while making shape.]
;W[ok]WL[1104.428]
;B[pi]BL[1144.669]LB[ol:A]C[This is a bad atari because it helps give White very solid shape. Better to just hane at A.]
;W[oj]WL[1102.006]
;B[ol]BL[1142.969]
;W[nl]WL[1098.603]
;B[om]BL[1140.011]
;W[pm]WL[1088.278]
;B[pl]BL[1136.759]
;W[nm]WL[1084.329]
;B[pn]BL[1126.077]C[Especially at the DDK level, it's very typical to see players atari when they have the chance. Typically speaking, atari is considered a bad move unless there is a strong follow up.]
;W[qm]WL[1079.046]
;B[on]BL[1119.84]
;W[po]WL[1070.39]
;B[no]BL[1112.784]C[Trying not to get sealed in, but this is a slow move now. ]

;B[mq]BL[1099.116]
;W[lq]WL[1030.561]
;B[pg]BL[1081.261]C[This insistence on playing in one area is a great example of kyu tunnel vision. Black's group is safe and shouldn't die, but Black's insistence on playing in this area is only helping White gain more and more influence.]
;W[pf]WL[1023.99]
;B[og]BL[1073.376]
;W[ng]WL[1012.347]
;B[nf]BL[1063.416]C[This cut shows nice fighting spirit.]
;W[nh]WL[996.69]
;B[ne]BL[1060.759]C[This is a nice calm extension.]
;W[ph]WL[993.212]C[Nice wedge by White.]
;B[qh]BL[1057.626]C[My reading ability clearly shows here.]
;W[qg]WL[991.978]C[And by show itself I mean how weak it is. Haha. Nice tesuji by White.]
;B[rk]BL[1048.153]C[This is where life and death skills really come in handy. Black wants to make sure he is alive, but this gives sente back to White.]
;W[lr]WL[984.876]
;B[de]BL[1015.536]C[Fortunately, I had enough sense to tenuki at this point.]
;W[ce]WL[870.207]
;B[dd]BL[1004.158]C[Wow. I'm surprised I tried to push here.]
;W[cd]WL[862.365]
;B[gd]BL[988.4]C[And this two space jump! How interesting.]
;W[ec]WL[856.492]
;B[df]BL[968.937]C[Nice calm extension. It seriously boggles my mind that I was keeping track of shape at DDK level. ]
;W[cf]WL[847.751]
;B[dh]BL[952.848]C[Obviously this shows my inexperience, but at least I'm trying to get ahead.]
;W[ch]WL[841.748]
;B[cg]BL[948.155]C[I had enough sense to wedge! Nice!]
;W[bg]WL[838.693]
;B[dg]BL[946.818]
;W[bh]WL[833.639]
;B[di]BL[922.84]C[Though Black is developing a nice wall, White's wall to the right is much more impressive and will negate much of anything Black will try to get from his wall.]

;B[mm]BL[828.813]C[Ouch... such bad shape...]
;W[nk]WL[754.67]
;B[kl]BL[827.454]LB[hm:A]C[I'm trying to make an eye here, but it's better to just run out.]
;W[gq]WL[746.223]

;B[im]BL[768.428]
;W[io]WL[694.704]
;B[ho]BL[762.653]LB[hm:A]C[Another example of "Oh I can atari so I'll atari!" Not good in this case since it fills in the group's liberty and makes the cut at A work.]

;B[kh]BL[727.539]LB[le:A]C[This is a great example of kyu jealously. White has barely any points in the center, but I'm still trying to reduce White instead of gaining steady profit with pushing at A.]
