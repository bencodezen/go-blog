PW[BenGoZen]PB[Tygem]BR[5d]
;B[pd]C[This is my debut back into Tygem and getting smashed by 5 dans.]
;W[dc]C[I played here thinking I would get to get a shimari fuseki....]
;B[dp]C[But cross-fuseki is perfect for Tygem players who's primary focus is fighting.]
;W[pp]
;B[de]
;W[ce]C[I decided to keep it simple and try to see how Black played when he has a good formation.]
;B[cf]
;W[cd]
;B[df]
;W[fc]
;B[dj]C[Standard sequence. This is good for Black. since it the formation works well with the D4 stone. ]
;W[fq]LB[cn:A]C[I approached here to prevent a double wing formation, and had intentions of switching directions at A if Black decided to pincer.]
;B[cn]
;W[dr]LB[jp:A]C[This move was made a little too hastily. I would've been more interested in finding out how Black would play if I played a faster move like A.]
;B[cq]
;W[iq]C[Since I dove already, might as well keep my group stable.]
;B[qn]
;W[np]C[Notice how I responded high here, this is to keep a better balance with my low stone at J3 and give my bottom some potential of growing (even if not much.]
;B[rp]
;W[qq]
;B[qk]
;W[nc]
;B[qf]C[So far it's pretty peaceful and straight forward.]
;W[jd]C[I decide to try for a faster move.]
;B[pb]C[Black continues to play solid. This is probably due to the fact that his frameworks are stronger and have more potential than mine.]
;W[ne]LB[lc:A]C[Honte (i.e. proper) move to defend against an invasion at A.]
;B[jp]C[This was a magnificently timed shoulder hit that completely flattens out White. Any prospects of growing the bottom are now completely gone.]
;W[jq]C[I push because I'm short on time and realize that my right corner still has an open skirt and not stable quite yet.]
;B[kp]
;W[lq]C[This is to stabilize my groups.]
;B[kq]C[Since White declared he wanted to keep his bottom safe, Black uses great forcing moves to strengthen himself.]
;W[kr]
;B[ip]
;W[hq]
;B[lp]
;W[mq]
;B[go]C[This move effectively seals White in and begins to grow Black's left framework.]
;W[pl]C[I try to reduce his right side in hopes of making the game more even.]
;B[ql]
;W[pn]
;B[qo]LB[pm:A]C[I thought this was an interesting response. Normal response is at A, but I think Black intended to keep sente with this move.]
;W[qm]
;B[rm]
;W[pm]
;B[gp]C[This is Black first slack move in my opinion.]
;W[fe]C[As a result, I tenuki and try to grow the top.]
;B[fg]C[This move prevents Black from growing further and also helps to grow Black's left side.]
;W[ik]C[I decided to try and reduce Black's center prospects, but the game proves that this may have been too soon.]
;B[id]C[Black's attachment shows that he begs to differ.]
;W[ie]C[I debated the hane for a while, because this generally helps to give the opponent sabaki (i.e., eye shape).]
;B[jc]
;W[kc]C[I decide to try something new.]
;B[kd]
;W[je]
;B[ic]
;W[kb]C[Here is my continued attempt to be different and try to maximize the efficiency of each of my moves.]
;B[md]
;W[nd]
;B[ke]
;W[kf]
;B[lf]
;W[le]C[This is small in retrospect, but I was just happy to read out that I could connect my groups.]
;B[ld]
;W[me]
;B[jf]
;W[kg]
;B[he]C[What I failed to realize is that this allows Black to break into my top side on the left, which means that Black's mission was successful.]
;W[if]
;B[hf]
;W[ig]
;B[hg]
;W[hd]LB[ih:A]C[This is my attempt to salvage the top, but this is too small. White should extend out to A to connect back with his reduction stone.]
;B[ih]
;W[jg]
;B[ki]TR[ik]C[Now White's marked stone is nearly surrounded and will have to fight for life on its own.]
;W[im]LB[fl:A][ll:B]C[I thought this was a good move to make miai of A or B for shape, but I think it's too slow considering I am deep in Black influence.]
;B[ll]C[Black correctly selects the right place to block. White is now truly surrounded.]
;W[fl]
;B[gm]
;W[fj]C[Trying to play light and resist playing what Black wants me to play.]
;B[gl]
;W[gk]
;B[hj]
;W[dk]
;B[ck]
;W[cj]C[If you're behind, crosscut to try and complicate things!]
;B[di]
;W[dl]C[I extend in hope of getting more shape.]
;B[cl]
;W[hk]
;B[jl]
;W[cm]
;B[bm]
;W[dm]
;B[dn]
;W[en]
;B[eo]
;W[fn]
;B[gn]
;W[hi]C[Trying to make something work here.]
;B[ii]
;W[ij]
;B[ek]C[Black's move here is proof of his reading ability. I was not able to see his end goal.]
;W[ej]
;B[em]
;W[el]LB[gi:B][fm:A]C[I thought I was alive at this point. Thinking A or B would let me live.]
;B[fm]TR[dk][dl][el][fl][cm][dm]C[And when Black calmly connects here, it becomes clear that my stones are in atari. Whoops.... xD ]
;C[With my center group dead, I resign. Not too shabby for playing a 5 dan. Haha. At least that's what I would like to believe. =D])
