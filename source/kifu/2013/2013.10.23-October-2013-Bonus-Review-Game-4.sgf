;B[qd]BL[2685.297]
;W[dd]WL[2690.718]TR[qd]C[Since Black's 3-4 komoku's weak side is already exposed, White should not hesitate to choose an opening move that prepares to take advantage of it. ]
;B[pp]BL[2671.276]
;W[dq]WL[2679.634]C[I chose the 3-4 komoku with the strong side facing the star point to avoid giving Black any simple approaches.]
;B[oc]BL[2652.964]
;W[nq]WL[2668.109]LB[qj:A]C[I decided to avoid the typical move of splitting at A and approach instead.]
;B[do]BL[2520.026]C[Black's tenuki here was a surprise.]
;W[fp]WL[2641.515]C[So I decide to response with a simple joseki that simes to builds the bottom.]
;B[cq]BL[2510.258]
;W[cr]WL[2637.498]C[Hane to prevent Black from gaining an easy base.]
;B[cp]BL[2507.79]
;W[er]WL[2635.903]C[Tiger's mouth to protect the cut and solidify the group.]
;B[ck]BL[2497.212]
;W[jp]WL[2632.499]C[This extension is farther than joseki might recommend, but I felt it worked well overall with the O3 stone.]
;B[pj]BL[2476.117]C[Though Black gets his extension at Q10, I was not too concerned since it is far from being solid territory.]
(;W[jd]WL[2551.094]C[Instead, I choose to take the last big point on the board since I did not want Black making an ideal double winged enclosure. See variation on Move 15 for an illustration of what I'm talking about.]
;B[cf]BL[2464.083]
;W[fd]WL[2506.499]LB[ch:A][ci:B][dj:C][dl:D][cm:E][dm:F]C[I decide to respond calmly because I did not want to make the same mistake as my last league game where I created a weak group. In addition, I saw that there were still quite a few weaknesses in Black's formation and would aim to utilize those later.]
;B[bd]BL[2418.355]
;W[cc]WL[2419.468]C[I decide to go ahead and protect the corner while stabilizing my group.]
;B[fn]BL[2362.923]LB[dh:A]TR[cf][ck]C[I think a move by Black at A would have been better in this situation. Here Black is trying to expand his left side, but his stones are on the third line and therefore the moyo he is trying to build is not very intimidating.]
;W[pn]WL[2384.213]C[So I decide to make the double approach and start to break up Black's formation on the right.]
;B[oo]BL[2302.848]C[Black aims to split the White groups.]
;W[qq]WL[2359.995]C[And then I decide to go ahead and remove Black's base while stealing the corner away.]
;B[qp]BL[2298.105]C[This direction seems correct.]
;W[pq]WL[2355.391]C[Extend to maintain connectivity.]
;B[rq]BL[2257.951]LB[oq:A]C[Black's hane here is slack in my opinion. The hane at A would be better since it would create defects in White's shape.]
;W[op]WL[2345.301]C[I quickly take advantage of Black's slack move to repair my shape.]
;B[no]BL[2119.603]C[I was surprised by Black's extension here.]
;W[po]WL[2334.374]C[Since he didn't protect the cut, let the fighting begin.]
;B[qo]BL[1905.66]
;W[qn]WL[2320.97]C[Block while reducing his group's liberties and preparing to seal him in.]
;B[rn]BL[1886.478]
;W[rm]WL[2301.124]LB[ro:A]C[Threatening the double atari at A.]
;B[so]BL[1869.649]
;W[rr]WL[2218.949]LB[ql:A][rp:B]TR[no][oo]C[I decided that protecting at A would be too heavy and want to gain some strength to attack the marked Black stones. So I hane here to threaten another double atari at B.]
;B[qm]BL[1854.19]C[Black must cut.]
;W[pm]WL[2190.584]TR[rm]C[Atari and sacrifice the marked stone.]
;B[ql]BL[1848.84]
;W[rp]WL[2182.597]C[Double atari.]
;B[ro]BL[1776.942]
;W[sq]WL[2180.104]LB[sp:A]C[And the best part about this capture is that it's sente. If Black ignores, White will atari at A.]
;B[rl]BL[1772.257]
;W[nm]WL[2166.191]TR[no][oo]C[And now I jump out into the center while attacking the marked Black stones.]
;B[lo]BL[1761.29]
;W[lm]WL[2157.022]LB[lp:A][lq:B]C[This may have been the wrong direction. White A or B seems like it secures profit while attacking the group.]
;B[kn]BL[1753.098]
;W[in]WL[2131.375]C[Continue the attack by removing a running direction for Black.]
;B[jm]BL[1748.433]
;W[lk]WL[1994.086]TR[lm][nm][pm][pn][qn][po]C[I decided to jump into the center to strengthen my weak group.]
;B[jo]BL[1680.229]
;W[kp]WL[1982.896]C[Here I want to take away Black's ponnuki shape while solidifying the bottom territory.]
;B[io]BL[1670.383]
;W[ip]WL[1964.307]TR[in]C[I am happy to let the marked stone get cut off while securing the bottom.]
;B[ho]BL[1664.254]
;W[lp]WL[1922.565]C[I decide to push this direction since I saw more weaknesses on this side.]
;B[pl]BL[1650.067]
;W[nn]WL[1917.884]C[Solid bamboo connection.]
;B[nj]BL[1640.731]
;W[oe]WL[1886.505]TR[lk]C[Since I had the marked stone in place, I felt that I should be able to run or make life, so I chose to go ahead and reduce Black's right side potential while I had a chance.]
;B[pf]BL[1618.406]
;W[pi]WL[1819.673]C[Then I came up with this attachment as an asking move to try and gain a foothold in Black's framework.]
;B[oi]BL[1589.795]
;W[oh]WL[1802.416]C[Counter hane.]
;B[ph]BL[1582.904]

;W[of]WL[1775.12]C[Counter atari again.]
;B[ng]BL[1525.327]
;W[qe]WL[1765.835]C[And with the net tesuji, my reduction of the right side was successful.]
;B[lc]BL[1520.883]
;W[pd]WL[1744.123]C[I decide to go ahead take advantage of my position to further destroy Black's territory here.]

;B[pb]BL[1418.275]
;W[ob]WL[1717.896]LB[qb:A][rc:B]C[Threaten to atari at A and then ladder at B.]
;B[od]BL[1319.947]C[Good forcing move by Black.]
;W[pe]WL[1715.064]C[Must connect.]
;B[qb]BL[1316.342]C[And Black connects as expected.]
;W[nd]WL[1708.579]C[But I have a bigger plan in mind.]

;B[oa]BL[1305.821]
;W[me]WL[1688.602]C[And I manage to get out into the center while almost sealing off my top side. Awesome!]
;B[ld]BL[1301.189]C[Black tries to resist.]
;W[md]WL[1683.708]
;B[jb]BL[1290.353]
;W[ic]WL[1666.707]C[Here I aim to press Black low and hold him to one eye so I can chase him around the board.]

;B[mh]BL[1234.832]

;B[nh]BL[1213.06]
;W[kf]WL[1578.145]C[And then wedge!]
;B[lf]BL[1176.179]
;W[le]WL[1575.812]C[Cut!]
;B[jf]BL[1173.201]
;W[kd]WL[1573.785]C[Cut!]
;B[dh]BL[1167.82]TR[lk][lm][nm][pm][nn][pn][qn][po]C[Thought Black's move gains territory, it is slack because White has a VERY weak group that is waiting to be severely attacked.]
;W[mo]WL[1539.33]TR[no][oo]C[White did not fail to notice his weakness though, and quickly repaired it by cutting off the marked stones.]
;B[hp]BL[1144.406]
;W[hq]WL[1528.656]C[Protect the bottom by blocking.]
;B[gk]BL[1117.492]
;W[ik]WL[1426.486]C[Now that I'm strong all of the board, I can afford to try out various invasions and reductions without any concern.]
;B[hm]BL[1002.455]
;W[fj]WL[1414.837]C[This move was a little deep. I was hoping it would work as a sholder hit of some sort.]
;B[gh]BL[996.123]C[But Black is very clear on the fact he should counter attack.]
;W[gj]WL[1375.568]C[Threaten to push out and connect.]
;B[hj]BL[950.485]
;W[fh]WL[1360.103]C[Attach to try and make shape and begin to create complications.]

;B[fi]BL[931.694]
;W[gi]WL[1221.778]TR[fh]C[I double atari here thinking Black will capture the marked stone.]
;B[hh]BL[871.562]C[But Black knows better.]
;W[ei]WL[1213.081]C[So I go ahead and capture.]
;B[eh]BL[866.835]C[And Black quickly falsifies my eye.]
;W[hi]WL[1211.081]C[But now I'm strong enough to push out and aim at Black's this shape.]
;B[dj]BL[809.066]C[Black chooses to protect his territory.]
;W[el]WL[1202.468]C[This is reckless since White is not yet alive.]
;B[fk]BL[801.416]C[In addition....]
;W[ek]WL[1195.81]C[White cannot connect. In terms of why I extended anyways, it was to possibly exploit some aji later on.]
