;B[ee]C[Splitting attack.]
;W[gf]
;B[fe]C[I thought this was sente to cut White, but it makes Black heavy and doesn't really give him a base to attack further.]
;W[if]C[White lightly dodges any complications at the moment.]
;B[kf]TR[jd][ld][kf]SQ[nc][nd]C[This move is both to strengthen the triangled group and to maintain the splitting attack against the squared group.]
;W[ch]
;B[eg]C[I thought I could split White apart here.]

;W[ij]
;B[cl]
;W[bd]
;B[cf]C[Thought this would be big and possibly kill the entire White group.]
;W[bf]
;B[ce]LB[df:A]C[Stone A is so small, so White can easily sacrifice it to live.]
;W[be]TR[dd][ce][ee][fe][cf][dg][eg][fg][gg][eh][fh][fi][gi]C[At this point, I noticed that the triangled group was getting weaker and dying.]

;B[mf]C[Attempt to salvage something!]
;W[cj]
;B[gl]TR[di][dj]C[This is me trying not to save everything. and realizing that the triangled stones are not important since both groups are very much alive.]
