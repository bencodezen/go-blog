;W[cl]C[I had never encountered a move like this in a handicap game, but then again, this is 9 stone handicap, so anything goes!]
;B[cn]C[Even at 10k, my thought was, "Pincer him and keep attacking!"]
;W[dh]
;B[fj]LB[cj:A]C[Unfortunately, my 10k self didn't realize that White could connect underneath. A would have been far more severe.]
;W[cj]
;B[dk]
;W[ck]C[White is now calmly connected.]
;B[dm]C[Black tries to stay connected.]
;W[er]
;B[dr]C[I thought I was protecting the corner this way.]
;W[dq]
;B[eq]C[But then I switch directions and plan to give him the corner in exchange for outside thickness.]
;W[cq]
;B[fr]
;W[ep]C[Then he goes and does this! Totally unexpected!]
;B[fq]
;W[do]
;B[fo]C[Trying to maintain my composure....]
;W[cr]
;B[eo]
;W[co]
;B[fp]C[Such a small move...]
;W[lq]
;B[kq]C[This is completely the wrong direction. This is a good example of trying to use thickness to make territory, which is a bad strategy.]
;W[kr]
;B[lp]LB[jr:A]C[Once again, I can't seem to make up my mind. A would have been better for my intended purpose.]
;W[mq]
;B[mp]
;W[nq]
;B[oo]C[This was a move to try and stay connected, but it looks like a mess to me now. Haha.]
;W[jq]C[And now I'm undercut.]
;B[ip]
;W[kp]
;B[ko]
;W[pl]
;B[nk]C[Trying to surround White.]
;W[nl]C["When you're weak, contact strong stones to gain strength!]
;B[ok]C[Here I think this is a good move cause it takes away his shape.]
;W[ol]C[But as you can see, White is a little heavy but is now solid and can try more shenanigans.]
;B[lk]
;W[qo]
;B[qn]C[Here's me trying to be innovative... but it looks rather stupid now. xD]
;W[pn]
;B[ql]C[Trying to remove White's base...]
;W[qm]
;B[qk]
;W[qp]C[Fail.]
;B[ml]
;W[qf]C[A normal approach! Yay!]
;B[qe]C[Kick!]
;W[pf]
;B[qh]C[And then I fail to extend at A like you normally should... Once gain, this is me trying to use thickness to make territory and trying WAY too hard to kill White.]

;B[re]
;W[rf]
;B[rc]C[I try to protect the corner, but White is now pretty strong.]
;W[qd]C[This completely surprised me. "What is he trying to do?!" I thought.]
;B[rd]C[Can't run!]
;W[pb]C[Oh wait....]
;B[qc]
;W[nb]C[So that was his intention...... ohhhhh.......]
;B[qb]
;W[oa]
;B[ne]C[Thought this peep would be good, but I should've just cut if that was my purpose. Ladder works for me anyways.]
;W[ph]
;B[oh]
;W[nf]C[I really liked this attachment. Prevents Black from cutting since he would get caught in a loose ladder. See variation.]

;B[ef]C[This was an attempt at a splitting move.]
;W[cc]C[The 3-3 was unexpected.]
;B[cd]
;W[eb]LB[dc:A]C[The only way to stop White from coming any further in is A, even though it is bad shape.]
;B[db]C[This is not the way to do it.]

;B[ed]
