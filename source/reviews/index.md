Like every other go player, you've discovered that trying to figure out what is worth your time and money can be an exhausting and expensive venture. Good news weary traveler, you no longer have anything to fear! Instead of spending your hard earned money, only to find out that the product you purchased wasn't to your expectations, you will now have the opportunity to benefit from my collector habits of trying to buy everything.

The one thing I assure you is this: **my reviews will always be objective and fair**. So rest assured, you will not hear any typical marketing BS that just talks about how wonderful the product is because they want to increase their sales numbers.

One more thing to take note, I am always open to reviewing any products that are go related. If you have something that you'd like me to take a look at and write a review on, just use the [contact form](http://www.bengozen.com/contact/)Â to send me an email and I'll see what I can do!
