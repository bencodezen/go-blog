Welcome to Go Equipment Reviews! Here you'll be able to see all of the Go equipment that I own and/or get to use along with the respective links to the reviews (once they become available). Like always, if you have any suggestions for improvements or other products you like better, please voice your opinion! Hopefully over time I'll be able to have a comprehensive Go armory that will encompass most of what people use. Until then, enjoy!
