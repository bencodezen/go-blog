		<description><![CDATA[Dunno! I have no vocabulary to figure out how good people are, and I&#039;ve encountered dramatically different levels of ability in people I&#039;ve talked to about ping pong. I know you at least know about spin, so you&#039;re not terrible, but beyond that... well, let&#039;s just say I&#039;m curious.
It&#039;d be fun to figure out a time to play - do you have a place you like to go? I&#039;ve only been to Joola.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Haha. Are you saying that just because I&#039;m Asian? That doesn&#039;t automatically mean I&#039;m good at ping pong you know? =P I have a feeling you could wipe the table with me. Haha.
And when you do have a chance to come down to the local club, be sure to let me know! =)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I don&#039;t know whether a game of ping pong with you is likely to be relaxing or not - it&#039;d definitely be fun to find out sometime.
I do wish I had the ability to go to a local club, but I just can&#039;t imagine when I would fit that in as the father of a young child. Hopefully when Axe gets older I can start taking him to play ping pong at Club Joola in Rockville.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I can completely empathize with what you&#039;re going through. It&#039;s kind of like what you said, you&#039;re probably actually progressing a lot faster; but there&#039;s something to be said about playing and growing with people of a similar rank with you so that the growth is more symbiotic and mutual.
I think what you need is a relaxing game of ping pong by demolishing me in a game. =D On a slightly more serious note though, perhaps it might be good to go to a local club and play some players there. Perhaps then you will see how far you&#039;ve come as a player! =)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve been on a big losing streak in ping pong. At work, I mainly play with two other guys, and the past few months they&#039;ve just been getting farther and farther ahead of me. I know objectively that I&#039;m playing the best ping pong of my life, but the constant defeats are hard to take. It makes me wish I could play against some weaker opponents, just to be able to feel like I&#039;m doing well.
But why should I require the arbitrary flag of victory? Why must I resent the two guys I play against? Couldn&#039;t a reasonable mind recognize that they&#039;re probably driving me to make faster progress than I might otherwise? Couldn&#039;t a reasonable mind look at some of the shots I can hit now and take pleasure in how amazing they would have seemed to me in the past?
But I do not have a reasonable mind, and I find myself weighed down by the frustration of losing.]]></description>
