		<description><![CDATA[Hey flippertie! So one of the ways you can access the variations is to click on the alternative move. It seems like in the build-in viewer, this is sometimes hidden if I marked it A. The easiest way though would probably be to download the SGF and open it in CGoban though if the built in viewer seems confusing. I&#039;ll try to make it more clear in future games though in case people only use the built-in viewer. Hope that helps!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[From time to time you mention &#039;see variation&#039; in your comments. Is this possible using the built-in viewer or do I need to download the SGF and open it in another viewer?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Move 16 - White S18 crossed my mind, but it seemed too passive and I didn&#039;t want to give Black the chance to seal me in afterwards. I think that would make his hane a good play when he was supposed to seal me in at the beginning.
You&#039;re totally right about Move 40 S12. That would have really sucked. Haha. The hane was actually an overplay. Just bad moves one after another. Haha. =D
Thanks for your feedback! See you around!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Bengo, thank you for the very nice review.
Move 16: Why not â€”â€”  White S18 ? Black can tenuki now, but after white Q18, black P18, white R19 â€¦ black has to protect P17 because the ladder is good for white. You would have regain sente and could just invade without â€žrunningâ€œ with the group? Don`t know if that makes sense, but that was my thought :-)
I think you are right about move 36, looks slowâ€¦
After move 40 what about next for black to play at S12?
Ok now  thanks again for the fine review! Cu]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Haha. It&#039;s all good. I&#039;ll have to be much more attentive next time I play him. I was multi-tasking at the time, so my slack moves just appear over and over. Haha. That won&#039;t ever happen again! =D]]></description>
