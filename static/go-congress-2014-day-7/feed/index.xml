		<description><![CDATA[I almost feel like I attended.  Thank you so much for such a well written series on the congress. I know it&#039;s late in the day to comment, but I just enjoyed reading these so much I had to say something!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Yeah. I imagine that MN would not have a lot of food options outside of campus. Ah well, I think the social factor would be a fair compensation even if the food were mediocre. Let&#039;s just hope it&#039;s not as bad as SF! And next time, we should grab meals together when possible!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The Congress in San Francisco was at a college campus with a meal plan. I am not sure if the meal plan was required or not that year. Sometimes the venue does not allow people to pass up the meal plan. I think that was the case in Tacoma. The food in the cafeteria on the SF meal plan was horrendous. I believe that they said that the meal plan will not be mandatory in Minneapolis when they were doing the presentation to the chapters at the General Assembly at the Congress this year. However, there may not be a lot of options for dining off campus. One way to meet new people has always been to fill out a table in the cafeteria. That wasn&#039;t an option this year, so I had my fears of being a mealtime wallflower. It wasn&#039;t as bad as I had expected. but I did have a fair number of meals alone.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Worst food was SF?! How is that possible?! That place is crawling with amazing food!! Haha. I just have to ask, what food was served?
Thanks for the reminder Terri. If it hadn&#039;t been for you, I probably would have felt obligated to play in Open every time. I&#039;ll be sure to keep that in mind when thinking about Congress next time!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I heard a lot of complaints about the food at the banquet. The worst congress food ever over all was in San Francisco. I think the year was 1999.
Not everyone plays in the main event at the Congress, though most people do. A woman at the congress told me one year that she never plays in the Open, but stays up late and plays a great deal of self paired games.
Forgetting about why you decided to spend the Congress as you did, it might actually be good for you since your main objective was to interact with the professional players. So don&#039;t automatically assume that you must play in the Open next year.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[It makes me so relieved to hear I&#039;m not the only one who thought the food was abysmal! But you&#039;re right, I completely forgot there was alcohol, which probably factored more into the cost than I&#039;m thinking (since I don&#039;t drink anyways).
You&#039;re welcome! I&#039;m always glad to share the achievements of those around me. Maybe next year I&#039;ll be able to compete fully and have a chance to be placed with winners like you and Diego!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The Congress was one of the best I ever attended, but the banquet was probably the worst ever in terms of the food. But you are right, it&#039;s about having the space for the ceremony. Plus was wine, which is not always the case, so it wasn&#039;t all bad.
Thanks for mentioning my award. I was totally taken by surprise when my name was called, as I thought I had missed my chance when I had not been included in the third place winners.]]></description>
