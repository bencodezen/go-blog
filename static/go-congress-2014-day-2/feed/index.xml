		<description><![CDATA[We can meet on KGS for the games assuming we each could bring ourselves to play a game. I played 10 rated games at the Congress. Since then I have only played four games and they were all with Yilun Yang so i HAD to play them because they were lesson games, and so they don&#039;t count. I&#039;ll try to get on KGS more often.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[You are right in being concerned about the fact that a first time attendee would not know to expect this, and would have hard feelings when being casually told, &quot;That&#039;s the way it&#039;s always been.&quot; So I agree that this was not a sensitive way to deal with your feelings at the time. They might have at least acknowledged that it would be good to have that information in the handbook for next year. Even if you hadn&#039;t read it and still been caught by surprise it would have taken the sting out of it for you. At least try to help others avoid future disappointment by getting in touch with next year&#039;s organizers and asking that the information be included.
Great blog, Ben. I&#039;m really enjoying the blog, and the dialogue too. Maybe I&#039;ll get down to the DC area some time.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks for playing devil&#039;s advocate Terri. I was certainly hoping someone would since I realize my emotions at the time were very one sided.
To start, I will state that I absolutely don&#039;t think that a person should have to wait the full time before winning the game. That would be crazy. However, while I absolutely realize that it&#039;s not fun for your opponent who is waiting for you for thirty minutes, the criticism and complaint is more-so against the way the logistics were handled. In fact, I don&#039;t know if I made it clear in my post above, but if it were in the fine print, I would have had no issues letting it go.
The issue with a rule like this being known to &quot;regulars&quot; and not to everyone is the fact that Go Congress is supposed to be a convention for all go enthusiasts, regardless of whether you are a tournament veteran or not. I can only imagine how a person would feel if Congress was his/her first major tournament and finding out a rule like this existed after the fact.
Therefore, at an absolute bare minimum, the rules need to be written down. Just as we are told what time settings and komi are going to be set for each and every match, forfeit rules should be no exception to this as well.
And especially with an event as large as Congress, I would also suggest that a tardy policy be instilled (especially when hosted at a place such as New York where not everyone is staying at the same hotel) where a person may call a designated number to inform the TD that they are running late (up to a reasonable amount of time). And if time constraints need to be considered, then the correct time punishment should be accounted for as well. For example, if late beyond 30 minutes, you go straight to byoyomi and forfeit the remainder of your main time.
Finally, one of the biggest things that irked me was the nonchalant attitude that most people had towards it. &quot;Well, it&#039;s always been that way.&quot; or &quot;Guess you&#039;ll know next time for Congress&quot; is absolutely not acceptable for someone like me who intends on spreading go to as many as people as possible. Can you imagine how I would feel if I had brought a group of newcomers to that Congress and they all lost by forfeit because of a rule that I (who is considered entrenched in go) didn&#039;t even know? For such a small logistical change, it&#039;s unacceptable.
And when all is said and done, I just want to reiterate that I really do appreciate you playing the devil&#039;s advocate Terri. I think it&#039;s important for both sides of an issue to be addressed (especially on a blog like mine) and I think you did a great job summarizing the opposing view to mine. Much appreciated.]]></description>
