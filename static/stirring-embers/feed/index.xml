		<description><![CDATA[I am sketching it out this week (SAAA Blog). It will be quite free-form, not tidy and so well organized as yours. I hope to bring some ideas from the chess world, relate them to Go. I&#039;ve always thought some of the Go ideas such as influence and shape were applicable to chess. John Fairbairn once spoke to world champion Anatoli Karpov about the subject and came away from the conversation with the idea that shape is indeed used in chess - but it is held as a sort of &#039;secret&#039; by the top players...
Happy Holidays to you, master. I hope your girlfriend is getting you that Lamborghini Aventador you&#039;ve been wanting. I do think painting it as a goban is a little much though... ;)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[As always, thank you Master for the remarks! You&#039;re a &#039;glass half-full&#039; sort of guy, I think. I was looking at some games in Go Review of the Takagawa-Lin Meijin in 1968. Komi was an even &#039;5&#039; with White winning a draw.
Just BTW - I like Go World but I think there was more real &#039;meat&#039; in Go Review. There was a cool life-and-death problem in one issue I&#039;d share if I knew how to get it online here.
I am thinking of starting a Go blog next year - &#039;Shodan at any Age&#039; to chronicle my offbeat approach to learning and studying the game...]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hey Molokai! To be honest, I think the fact that komi has gone up is a great sign that we are changing and re-evaluating the value of the first move. To be honest, I don&#039;t take much solace in the change in komi since my goal is always to play better moves. If I lose by one extra point cause of komi, then I need to play two points better next time. =) What are your thoughts on it?
Happy holidays to you as well! I&#039;m glad that you&#039;ve enjoyed this year&#039;s post (even though it has had its ups and downs). I&#039;m certainly looking forward to what 2015 brings as well.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi, Ben -
Just curious...How do you feel about the constantly rising komi in Go. It has gone from 4.5-&#062;5,5-&#062;6.5-&#062;7.5 over the years? Does it in anyway detract from your overall view of the game? It seems the first move in Go is even more meaningful than in chess. I don&#039;t know how it would be calibrated but 7.5 seems like close to a full pawn in chess. The first move in chess is often equated with having the serve in tennis.
Happy holidays to you and yours. Thanks for all the great articles, analyses this year. Very enjoyable and most educational! I think this year has been a &#039;digesting&#039; year for you and your strength will soar in 2015!]]></description>
