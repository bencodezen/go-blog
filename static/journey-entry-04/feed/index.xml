		<description><![CDATA[Re: pros on GoQuest. Ohashi Hirofumi 6p is the top player in 9x9 and 13x13 at the moment (spaceman). I know this from reading his Twitter feed (in Japanese): https://twitter.com/ohashihirofumi
He&#039;s a well-known problem maker, so it makes sense that he does well on small boards w/ lots of life &#038; death situations. His 13x13 games often involve interesting openings like 5-7. I think spaceman is a nickname he has from playing weird openings on 19x19.
Mannami Nao 3p also talks about GoQuest on Twitter: https://twitter.com/naonao_myu
And it&#039;s pretty clear that her account is naonaonao.
kuronekoking was #1 on 13x13 for a while, and there are rumors that this is Cho U 9p. Circumstantial evidence for this: Cho U made a 4x4 Go puzzle game called &quot;kuroneko no yonro&quot; (&#039;black cat&#039;s 4x4&#039;).
There are other pros who have tweeted about playing GoQuest, so I suspect there are quite a few of them near the top of the rankings. The top players are at worst &quot;nearly pro,&quot; and I think it&#039;s worthwhile sometimes to watch their games.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Yeah. The extra life thing is kind of weird. It seems like maybe they limit the number of games you can play a day? I don&#039;t play even close to that much each day, so I wouldn&#039;t know if there&#039;s an actual limit.
In terms of the interface though, I think it would be better if they allowed you to confirm your move since I&#039;ve made a couple of misclicks along the way. Otherwise though, solid app considering it&#039;s free.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[[&#8230;] Three weeks and count­ing! I am feel­ing like I am start­ing to make some real progress as I con­tinue to adhere to my train­ing reg­i­men. Though I thought about upping my prob­lem solv­ing reg­i­men, I think it’s at a good place where I am mak­ing decent progress while the task is rel­a­tively easy to accom­plish. And as you’ll notice, I also added a play­ing reg­i­men as well which is very eas­ily sup­ported via the GoQuest app I talked about in my jour­nal entry ear­lier this week. [&#8230;]]]></description>
