		<description><![CDATA[I liked the little L&#038;D problem in the upper-right.  One of the few things in Go that I can actually understand a little bit.  But it wasn&#039;t until move 50 that it was visually obvious to me that white had taken a bullet to the brain.  That&#039;s how I know I&#039;m still DDK, lol.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I sometimes wonder if my willingness to use big moyo type strategies is just an expression of greed or whether it&#039;s actually a good thing.
In terms of my willingness to cut, I would have to say that it is perhaps the most important thing I remember from the one private lesson I had with Shifu years ago. &quot;Gold move is always top priority. If you can cut, then you should cut!&quot;And then when you combine that with my propensity towards fighting, I guess it synergies well together. Haha.
Our games always push me to try and find the most severe move possible. And whenever you play a move, I also have to say that I usually feel a big pressure not to fall into a trap or to try and find the best counter to your attacks.
Looking forward to our next game.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I think it does expose a relative weakness in my game and a relative strength in yours. Your willingness to use big frameworks is slightly unusual at our level, and puts me a bit off-kilter... I&#039;m not as good at finding the honte move when facing that style.
Your other big strength, of course, is your willingness to cut. I went over the joseki that follows from the cut at O4 a bunch with Shifu, and it&#039;s not easy at all for either player, but it seems as if that&#039;s the only kind of game that even interests you, which is awesome. Even if you can&#039;t always play to match your ambition (here, that sequence ended in a gain for white, even if white promptly gave up that gain), it&#039;s like a guiding star for your game, leading you to get stronger and stronger.
I think I&#039;m a little that way, too, so don&#039;t think I&#039;m purely dishing out selfless praise. It&#039;s a good attitude to nurture.]]></description>

And don&#039;t be so hard on White, he put up a valiant fight that presented multiple opportunities for me to make mistakes and allow him to turn the game around. It was far from an easy game.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Haha XD
If I were to say anything, it would probably be about move 23. Couldn&#039;t you have gone to R2 and saved the corner with influence toward the center? An extension at M7 later would have worked.]]></description>
