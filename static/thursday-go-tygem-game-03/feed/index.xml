		<description><![CDATA[I see what you mean about the &quot;giant stick.&quot; Similar to what Daurak said, because he has so many liberties and is connected to so many groups, it&#039;s very difficult to harass it right now. And don&#039;t forget, after the full harassing sequence, White is most likely going to be left with a lot of weak groups which he can then come back to counter attack and probably kill.
Move 98 - The atari is necessary (from the other direction) in order to take care of my L9 group. Because I&#039;m fragmented into multiple groups, surrounding him is very hard since he can cut and try to start a capturing race.
Does that help clarify things?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Move 26 - The reason I played K17 was to have an extension and to also negate the influence of Black&#039;s wall. I thought if Black got a chance to approach, he would have nice potential at the top while I would only get a small corner.
Move 28 - Agreed. Definitely should have played in the left corner.
Move 36 - I didn&#039;t think about that! The other direction definitely seems to have more potential. Perhaps I was thinking of just stabilizing my group.
Q7 was an overplay on my part. That fight was rather unreasonable. For some reason I thought the corner would die. Haha.
J7? That&#039;s black though.
Thanks for the comments. Appreciate the insight!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[localy O18 and O16 are miai, so even if it looks like there is stick to push around, its conected with all stones (virtually alive),
I think atari is essential if u want make strong group, stronger group make it better to attack, tho at this point there isnt good way to attack, in normal game ofc, here is at this point to kill and win a game, so worth try something else, so instead of atari L11, maybe H10 to close black in and see if it manage to kill it, if not, its wrong way.
at 97 move black already got 60~ cash and white at most 45~]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Two things, after move 69, Black has one giant stick that can be potentially pushed around.  Maybe O18 and then jumping out around O15, or directly to O15/ N13?  What are your thoughts?  And also on move 98, do you even need to atari, or can you start killing his eye shape or surrounding?  Thanks!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[for me k17 (26) and b17 is kind of miai, so no point of playing there at least not from start.
28 kind of slow, but still playable tho seems lower left corner better.
I think o3 (36) I would play from R6 side since it got more potential for white than lower side. so if black would o3 on white r6 white could take big point at Q9/10.
q7 was your mistake in my opinion, o5 is good &#039;cause corner seems live either way, so that 1 lonely stone at m3 should be your point off attack
another thing was feeling of ur j7, was like overkill, I would h7 but I guess its diffrent way of attackin, but thats diffrent game tho ^^
overall game was pretty nice feelin for white ^^]]></description>
