		<description><![CDATA[Agreed. I can definitely say that I&#039;ve made the mistake of just quickly overviewing books. The advice by the dan / professional players is definitely great to keep in mind. Thanks for sharing!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I agree with you. Better to go slowly and repeatedly to acquire
a solid foundation. Quick overview of books leads to nothing. This is what strong
players say. A strong French player of Japanese descent (8d) recommends reading
the books at least 10 times before understanding something. Another player,
Chinese (8d-2p), emphasizes the very gradual acquisition by repetition. But it
is very tempting to cut corners!!]]></description>
