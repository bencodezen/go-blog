		<description><![CDATA[Hey Clement!
Glad to hear that you are back in go! Congratulations on the 1D on KGS! Definitely hope that you can hang on to it!
I&#039;ve never heard of Tsumegos by M. Noguchi. Is it a French book?
Real life tournament are awesome! I&#039;m so jealous that you&#039;re going to get to play so many! I definitely need to come to France soon!
Best of luck in your games and I hope we can play again soon. Take care till then!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Ben !
    It&#039;s been a long time I didn&#039;t post on your (always as great :-) ) blog, I was waiting forward to this Friday go Forward ^^. It seems like I am back in go, and I decided to read books not randomly as I previously did (like start a book, then later another, etc, and never know what I&#039;ve read, understood or not).
  Then here is my record recently :
     * 1 win against 1d on tygem
     * 3 wins versus 1k + 3 loss versus 2d,1k,~3k(?) on KGS, some ranked, some not
     * GREAT NEWS : I&#039;M 1D KGS ! ^^ (hope it&#039;ll last)
And about the books :
     * finished the first part of Tsumegos by M. Noguchi
     * in the middle of the introductory problems of Get Strong At The Endgame
     * starting Get Strong At Life And Death (not sure i&#039;ll like this book)
  Another news : I&#039;ll play several &quot;real life&quot; tournaments after summer, one in Bordeaux (with Tiphaine, Albane and Jean, I hope they will play and progress until here :) ) and one in Lille (and I hope some others soon).
 This week i&#039;ll try to play at least one or two serious games each morning, ranked automatches or friendly games, we&#039;ll see. Hope I&#039;ll play interesting games and learn things !
  see you soon !]]></description>
