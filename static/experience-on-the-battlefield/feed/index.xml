		<description><![CDATA[Thanks! The funny thing is that 10 minutes sounds like a really fast game, but I realized that it&#039;s actually not all that short. My games still take anywhere from 30 minutes to an hour and I do quite a bit of thinking.
As long as you&#039;re careful about not studying too much instead of playing, then I think you&#039;ll be alright. Hope to see a new post from you soon (but no pressure if you&#039;re busy with other things)!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Ah!! Thank so much for reminding me which post it was that I wrote regarding the 30 min main time! So glad that someone knew what I was referring to. Haha.
The funny thing is that I&#039;m not sure I would have really heeded advice like this in the past if it weren&#039;t from Myung Wan Kim 9P giving me the guidance.
I certainly hope that the new time setting will help you play more games and gain that next stone.
Meeting at Congress would be awesome!! I am definitely going so be sure to let me know if you decide to go!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I find the difference between this post and your &quot;the 6k screwup&quot; post from a while ago where you basically said you would not play games with less than 30 min main time as 10 minutes is just blitz pretty interesting.
Anyway, I&#039;ve been in the same boat for far longer than I&#039;d care to admit, and this post did strike a chord with me. I&#039;m going to try to follow your way and make more of an effort to play game around similar time setting soon. I was stuck at the same rank for a very long time and only recently have I gotten a few ranks stronger from playing some games, hopefully I can continue it. There&#039;s also a chance that we could play each other in this years go congress.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Great post. Was thinking about playing less recently, and i`m not playing as much as before, but sill i think it is good to play some fast games here and then, because one can gain, as you said it very good: experience. :-) ]]></description>
