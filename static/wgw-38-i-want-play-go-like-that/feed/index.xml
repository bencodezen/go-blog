		<description><![CDATA[Unfortunately, no, hulu and most services anything like it don&#039;t work in Canada at all.  We do have netflix.ca, but it&#039;s not nearly as good as in the US.
There is a way to cheat, of course, using proxy services so that they are technically streaming to an IP registered in the US.  I simply don&#039;t want to think too much about the stupidity of it all, so I&#039;ll just have to wait twenty years until the laws and business models reflect the reality of ten years ago.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Haha. Agreed. Though like I mentioned above to Daurak, what was interesting about this game was that it wasn&#039;t like her moves were particularly new or unique. Like it wasn&#039;t a tesuji or anything, it was as if the normal moves she were making had their own life and quality to them. =D]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[What&#039;s interesting is that it&#039;s not so much that her moves were brilliant tesuji or anything. It was just an emotion that overcame me as I watched her play. And to be honest, they seemed like perfectly ordinary moves you or I would play, but it felt totally different. Probably sounds crazy... but that&#039;s how it felt.
Hope you can find a good version of the anime soon! I still love the manga for being the original, but it&#039;s nice to see the anime from time to time.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[That&#039;s great that you are able to appreciate professional games so early on in your journey. I know that I&#039;ve always had issues being able to see their moves and probably still do to some extent.
What I will say is that Game 3 was definitely not an attempt for me to imitate professionals. Haha. That was just me being unable to be calm and just trying to kill everything I could. =D If it were an attempt to imitate professionals, I think I wouldn&#039;t be nearly as ashamed of it. Haha.
Appreciate hearing your side of things. Definitely reminds me that I have a ways to go when it comes to how I review professional games. =)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[That&#039;s why I spend most my time reviewing professional games.  Their moves are beautiful and powerful.  Quiet, yet full of meaning.  I enjoy every game I review, and will stay up late hours going over them.  I have to slow myself down in game, though, because my reading ability is obviously not on par with theirs.  For game three of yours, to me it looked like what I do sometimes.  I really want to play like a pro so most of my stones are light and efficient, but to play light you have to read a lot.  By playing solid, our thick, it gives me the upper hand in some of the fights.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I think I need to get a little stronger yet, in order to feel that way about well-played Go.  Nice to think it can happen before an amateur makes shodan!  I really have to watch Hikaru all the way through.  I read the manga, but I&#039;ve never watched the anime all the way through (it&#039;s not on Netflix in Canada or anything like that, so when I&#039;ve looked I&#039;ve only found bad transfers on youtube available, or DRM itunes stuff that I can&#039;t stream to my TV ... maybe I&#039;ll go see if I can actually buy disks somewhere...).]]></description>
