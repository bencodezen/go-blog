		<description><![CDATA[Nice review. I was actually hoping for you to do one, but I missed it since it doesn&#039;t show up in your book list. From what you wrote, this book seems to fit my strength quite perfectly, but it&#039;s not as if I didn&#039;t have a lot of unread go books on my shelf already. I do hope nevertheless that you get around to review the rest of the series eventually.
tl;dr: Thanks. =)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I actually just bought this book and read it in two days.  It was an excellent and simple read, creating a stronger foundation in concepts I knew, and introducing some new ones.  I highly recomend it.
I played a game in person the day after (today) I finished it, and could tell I used a lot of things from it, and without it wouldn&#039;t have done as well.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks Robbie! In terms of tesuji books, I&#039;ll be honest in that I haven&#039;t found one that I quite perfectly love for someone just starting out with tesuji. The most enjoyable one I&#039;ve read to date is &quot;Get Strong at Tesuji,&quot; but it can be a bit advanced at times which is why it&#039;s not my go to book for players around 10k.
I don&#039;t believe the fourth book of the series has been published yet, but I will be sure to post a review on it the moment it is printed and I can get my hands on it. Looking forward to seeing you this Saturday!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Superb review, Ben.  Thanks so much for the effort.  It is now being ordered at my house!  I would have never ordered this book without this review. Have you reviewed any good Tesuji books that presents things clearly and basically as well? Maybe the fourth one of the series?]]></description>
