		<description><![CDATA[Haha. Freelancing is still rather rough. And not freelancing does not make you a bad person. Haha. It&#039;s clear you know where your priorities are. Mine are clearly haywire. XD
And thanks for the congrats! Haha. Looks like I definitely don&#039;t get a handicap from you according to KGS anymore. =P]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;Chi­nese, free­lanc­ing, blog­ging, and go while work­ing full-time and hav­ing some sort of social life...&quot;
I&#039;m exhausted just thinking about it. I could never really handle even freelancing + working full-time. I just didn&#039;t have the dedication to pour my outside time into the safe stuff I did while at work. Does that make me a bad person? Yes.
Congratulations on the 4k bump - I could finally play you a rated game without giving you a handicap! (Not that I plan on it.)]]></description>
