		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m not claiming to be great at it, but learning to feel the strength of solidity, thickness, and influence like this is one of the chief parts of getting stronger. When I was weaker, I never liked these abstract moves - I wanted value! Territory! But as I learned to just *wait* for the power of moves like this to manifest themselves, I found myself having many games where the latter half of the game was fun for me, where it was my opponent who had to jump in to difficult fights and fight for their life. And as that fighting created disadvantageous exchanges, I would watch in amazement as territory materialized.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[First: it&#039;s expanding along the fourth line, the line of victory. Second: it&#039;s reaching out ahead of white toward the top, where black has tons of potential. Third: if you doubt that it&#039;s sente, imagine the most obvious followup move, at P9. THAT&#039;S a move where the feeling of power is unmistakable.]]></description>
