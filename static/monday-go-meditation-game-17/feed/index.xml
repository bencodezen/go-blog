		<description><![CDATA[I totally understand. I think that blitz games by nature generally are usually pretty one sided. Haha. Unlike you however, I have not been able to play as much and am starting to feel a little rusty in terms of playing a game. So It&#039;ll be interesting to see how tonight&#039;s game goes!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Yeah. I don&#039;t know whether it&#039;s ultimately good for me to play the frequently crappy games I play under that account, but the reality is that it lets me get in a lot more go than I otherwise would, since I can sneak in games when I don&#039;t have enough time to play a proper game. I veer back and forth between phenomenal crushings and hilarious collapses.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Haha. So that&#039;s where you&#039;re getting your playing experience from. I had a feeling there was no way you were only playing the occasional game on cloudbrows and the one game at the workshop a month. =P]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;For now, as White, I am avoiding giving Black the opportunity to start a cross-fuseki since I&#039;m trying to get a better grasp of fuseki as a whole.&quot;
That&#039;s fair, though I love the advice that I read... shit! Where did I read it? Well, somewhere I read an author claiming that in his visit to Japan, there was a lot of discussion about narrow vs. wide games. Narrow games had fewer possibilities, more obvious next steps. Wider games had more going on, more paths for development, more complication. And the general agreement was that narrow games favored black, since it offered the clearest way to maintain the advantage of going first. A cross-corner opening is an immediate jump to a wide game, which is why white will usually offer it to black.
White move 10 is another case where as white, I would be delighted to offer a wider game to black by approaching his unfinished corner at R5 rather than approach the top: more groups, more fighting, less territory, and komi becomes a bigger and bigger asset.]]></description>
