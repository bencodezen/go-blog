		<description><![CDATA[Hey Pierre. That&#039;s a pretty interesting concept! Though it begs the question of the human need to measure themselves in some sort of fashion (i.e., I&#039;m a black belt and you&#039;re a white belt), I think many players could actually benefit from that type of service. Great suggestion!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Ben,
I was thinking, it would be nice on Go Servers to have an option &quot;don&#039;t bother me with ranks&quot; that basically hides all informations about ranks (own rank and other players ranks). In the  background, the server would keep tracking progress for each players and matches players according level and habdicap preference. One would only be able to play throught automatch.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This is good news, Ben! I do think you gradually cornered yourself not playing some games. I had the same issue at chess years ago. Part of it was I enjoyed studying so much I kept thinking, &quot;I&#039;ll just wait until I am a little bit better - then start playing again.&quot; You&#039;re a sharp cookie, Master; I am confident you&#039;ll always find your way down the correct path.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hey Devin. I should have realized that it would have been interpreted that way (since I had done the same when I first encountered it), but I meant it more along the lines of &quot;rank ladder anxiety.&quot; Although to your point, I know that I certainly need more work on my ladder reading and definitely could use Kageyama&#039;s advice as a reminder to keep on working on them.
Thanks for the support as always man. Hope things are going well in YSD!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hey Ben, its interesting that you talk about &quot;ladder anxiety&quot;.  Just today I started re-reading Lessons in the Fundamentals of Go and the first subject Kageyama talks about is ladders!  :)  In fact, he talks about practicing reading out ladders every day and says, &quot;This exercise will earn you a valuable reward:  the confidence that you can read any ladder anywhere, anytime.  This confidence heralds your next big stride.  A great many people have broken through their barriers by sticking persistently to this method... Keep at it every day and soon the ladders that used to plague you will become the easiest things in the world to read out.  You will not have the slightest difficulty reading out a ladder in a few seconds -- a superhuman feat to anyone who does not know the game of go&quot;
That was really long but basically I just wanted to say, hang in there!  Keep practicing and soon your anxiety will turn into confidence.  Best of luck to you :)]]></description>
