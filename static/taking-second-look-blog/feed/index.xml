		<description><![CDATA[wow, looking forward to new changes ;) and I have to admit I started to like Thursday&#039;s posts and their format so if you can incorporate this into more reviews, the better. so not only those one-point lessons (pls do not abandon them), also structured review in form of opening, midgame, endgame, strategy, flow of game... etc are very good points for orientation regarding particular game.  keeeeep the great work going ;)]]></description>
