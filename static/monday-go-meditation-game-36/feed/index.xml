		<description><![CDATA[I think that depends on what kind of go you want to play. If you thrive in a place of greater creativity, it might be good to embrace more unusual openings. You can knock your opponent out of their comfort zone and create opportunities for more complicated fights.
I&#039;m not as good at that - I love when I can play with a kind of Lee Chang-ho style smoothness and confidence, each move flowing naturally from a clear understanding of position. Let my opponent fret as my calm opening begins to open up a lead, then let them jump in out of jealousy, create a target, and struggle to live as I develop thickness and territory that will win me the game. Obviously, it&#039;s one thing to state this as a goal and another to have the clarity of judgment to play that way.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I remember when you played that opening back when I first met you. I asked about it, and you commented that most people just let you complete the shimari with your next move. I also remember you being an ambitious, whole-board player from early on, something that never came as naturally to me. From my perspective, your core skills are a desire to play your own game (not following) and strong fighting spirit, and that&#039;s been true of you since the very first time we played.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Nice game and commentary. I think a lot of us forget how adventurous we were in our earlier days: when you don&#039;t really know the 4-4 joseki, why not try out the 5-3, or wide pincers with complicated followups, or calm progression? In a lot of our cases, the fear of blundering through unknown joseki and unstudied strategies comes later, when we&#039;ve got a few nuggets of good knowledge to wield desperately against the world =). It&#039;s a good mindset to try to re-cultivate.]]></description>
