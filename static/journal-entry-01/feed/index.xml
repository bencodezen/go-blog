		<description><![CDATA[Thanks! Believe it or not, I was having issues writing posts sometimes because I would sit there thinking what I would title things. And then next thing you know I&#039;ve titled a post something I would probably have titled an article. Classifying these types of rants / posts as simple Journal Entries should make for much fluid blogging.
Appreciate the support as always man! It&#039;s definitely much needed as I start everything back up!]]></description>
