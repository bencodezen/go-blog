		<description><![CDATA[Hahaha. Thanks! I do think that the switch from problems to time based has definitely been beneficial. And just to clarify my 20 minute time frames, those are more guidelines than anything else. My game reviews / actual games tend to take longer than that; but at the bare minimum, if I&#039;m super busy, I spend 20 minutes reviewing a pro game. =) Hope your training is going well also!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Good progress. I especially like how you changed the number of problems to timings. The video lessons seem pretty nice as well. Maybe you should try to add more time to your experience training because if you try to limit a game to 20 minutes, it could be very hard to focus on the game. KEEP TRAINING!!!!!!! =)]]></description>
