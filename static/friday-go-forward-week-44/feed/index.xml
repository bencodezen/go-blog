		<description><![CDATA[I appreciate the send off! Fortunately though, I won&#039;t be going anywhere too far! Though it felt like the blog may have been going on hiatus for a while, I&#039;ve been looking things over and it seems that it won&#039;t be as long as I thought. =) Thanks for your support!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Rob, Your words of kindness are appreciated in ways that I cannot even begin to describe. Fortunately though, I will not be going anywhere too far though! This hibernation should not be long and hopefully I will be able to be in a better position to provide the content everyone has come to enjoy regardless of whatever life throws at me. Once again, thanks again and no worries: I&#039;m sure that we will see each other soon at the tournaments. =)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Ben, you have been a tremendous inspiration to me personally and although you don&#039;t know it, to a group of go players down south in Stafford, Virginia. Each time you posted game together with comments, we went through that game as a group. Your comments often cracked us up but also taught us a great deal through both those words and the games themselves. I don&#039;t believe anyone ever told you about this, but typically we went through two, &quot;Ben&#039;s games&quot; each month and we did it as a group of 4 to 6 people. We will certainly miss your input and encouragement. Meanwhile best of luck to you, it has been a tremendous pleasure to read your blogs and to get a glimpse of your excitement for this tremendous game and for your views about not just go but life in general. You&#039;re a great man Ben and your blog will sorely be missed. I look forward to seeing it again in the future and meanwhile wish you the very best.  I&#039;ll see you at the tournaments.]]></description>
