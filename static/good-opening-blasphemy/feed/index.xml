		<description><![CDATA[Thank you for reposting this article. I had a feeling it was from a conversation I had with you. Haha.
I just think it&#039;s funny how I have a &quot;good sense&quot; of the opening when I always it was a weaker than the rest of my game. I guess that&#039;s why it&#039;s always good to get an outside opinion!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[No question.
Btw, just for reference, here&#039;s a post I often refer to by Janice Kim about the opening: http://www.samarkand.net/learn-go-blog/portland-hunger-games/
&quot;The idea of the opening is to set yourself up in the most favorable way you can so that the middle game and endgame go your way, but you can overcome even a horrific opening if your opponent makes one bad mistake afterwards. Since everyone is making bad mistakes pretty much all the freaking time, there’s not a lot of sense in focusing on fine-tuning your opening. You will improve your winning percentage far more by improving your reading skills by doing life-and-death problems, than you will by studying the opening.
&quot;That being said, you can learn how to play a great opening with *far less effort* than it takes to play a great middle or end game, so, you might as well. You might think learning the opening may be tedious or difficult, particularly memorizing several thousand joseki, and then taking the following mandatory annual continuing education joseki classes. But once you get the basic principles, particularly efficient stone deployment vis-a-vis the third and fourth lines, it will be a rare person who can play the opening better than you.
&quot;(Key words noted by asterisks: far less effort. Those are the key words. If this sounds disturbingly slacker to you, you can think: there is truth and beauty in efficiency.)
&quot;Americans tend to play the opening pretty well, because that’s been where the time is spent in books and lessons — learning middle game skills basically means time spent doing reading and counting exercises, and Go is supposed to be fun.&quot;]]></description>
