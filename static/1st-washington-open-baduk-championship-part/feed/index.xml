		<description><![CDATA[Oh man. I love the fact that you made a Hajime no Ippo analogy! And yes, it totally makes sense. I completely agree that my go ended up being entirely too passive and meek. A part of me does believe that had i played my normal go, the game would have been very very different. Haha. Thanks for the awesome reference and helping me get a clearer sense of what happened!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I read the April Go Challenge think you had a link to on this article, and I must say that I think your idea of being calm and patient ended up (at least for game 2) making your play a bit to passive and meek than it otherwise would&#039;ve been.  I like to think that your moves were like Nao&#039;s punches in his title fight with Ippo.  You both had this goal in your mind (Nao&#039;s was to just have the fight with Ippo and your&#039;s was to follow through with the challenge) that you weren&#039;t playing as otherwise might have.  Although, unlike with Nao, I think you could have beaten your opponent.  Hope the Hajime no Ippo ananlogy made some sense.  Comeback with 3-2 record for part II =)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hahaha. Just the reaction I was looking for.
(And the salmon bento box was awesome. To be honest, I think it would have totally been worth $10 if they wanted to charge for it.)]]></description>
