		<description><![CDATA[Sure - I guess I just find it interesting to think about what parts of a go set are worth sacrificing for certain savings and which aren&#039;t. For me, at least imagining it, it seems like the rigid surface is fundamental to go. This might be more useful, IMO, as a 9x9 or 13x13 board, where it&#039;s clearly just a temporary tool for teaching.
But, sure - if this has an audience, it&#039;s fine. Just thinking aloud.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I hear you man, which is why I try to push for the Go Bento Box if at all possible. On the other hand though, I had to account for the fact that there may be people where that price is still out of range. So for that consideration alone, I still felt that at least you were getting a usable go set out of it.
Not something I would recommend personally, but there is a case and situation for it, so for those people, I have left my thoughts and consideration to them. =)]]></description>
