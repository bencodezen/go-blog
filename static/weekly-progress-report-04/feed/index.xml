		<description><![CDATA[My prescription for a training regimen is always what you enjoy doing. After all, while we all may like to dream about it, few of us are seriously aiming for becoming a professional and thus the important of keeping it fun and simple to maintain is key.
So in light of that, I say keep on with your game memorizations! Any kind of work you put into the game will have long term effects in my opinion.
Of course, a little dose of tsumego and tesuji will also do your future self a bit of good as well. Haha.]]></description>

I&#039;m on the west coast, and am a bit of a night owl. What sort of hours are you usually available to play?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I haven&#039;t set a solid regimen as yet, but I&#039;ve been studying at least a couple hours a day, and have been really enjoying memorizing some pro games by players that I admire.
I like to get the commentated ones (especially with really detailed commentators like Yuan Zhou) so that I can have some hope of understanding some of what&#039;s going on.
I realize that memorizing games is not what every teacher would recommend at my level (10k-ish) but it&#039;s easy for me, and I enjoy it, and I strongly suspect that it is helping me on a subconscious level to better understand good haengma, etc.
Need to get back to doing some more tsumego and tesuji though too.]]></description>
