		<description><![CDATA[Hahaha. What a great analogy! Love the poker reference and I think it&#039;s quite appropriate. xD Thank you for helping to rephrase things in such an easy to understand way! Hopefully we will be able to avoid this tendency as we get stronger. =)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I think you are spot on with your assessment. It&#039;s funny, I think it&#039;s a self-fulfilling prophecy. We have trouble proving the territory we claim is ours so we try to put ourselves so far ahead that even if we defend poorly we&#039;re ok. This makes it harder to defend so we think &quot;We need to get every further ahead&quot;
It&#039;s like bluffing in poker: we&#039;re trying to make our opponent resign so we don&#039;t have to prove that our moyo is not a house of cards.
I think this is the same mentality that makes kyu players want to punish their opponent as soon as they make a mistake and end up giving our opponent a free move to fix it.]]></description>
