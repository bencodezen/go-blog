		<description><![CDATA[Looks a perfect portable, thanks for the review Ben.  Hey something I&#039;ve thought about mentioning before but particularly now that your in full swing review mode, larger images where more detail can be seen would be a nice bonus (think you can make it so you can keep them the smaller size on your page but then when we click the image boom FULL SCALE).  Anyway just a thought.  Continue to enjoy your observations around this awesome game, keep up the good work! :D]]></description>
