		<description><![CDATA[I agree with the revelation about losing a game since I read that part of The Empty Board which titled &quot;Partners vs. Opponents&quot;.
These were the magic words for me: &quot;You must play well, not just so that you may win, but so that you can enjoy the game. When I try something in a game, not knowing just where it will lead, I don&#039;t want my partner to just collapse. I want the other player to come up with a challenging response that will push us both to higher levels of play. That is our common goal, to reach higher levels of play, not just to win games.&quot;
Have a nice day! :)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I don&#039;t know - personally, I find that there are still TONS of lessons to take from games in which I won. There&#039;s no lack of mistakes. But it&#039;s a little easier for me to take the brutality of the review if I know that at least I won. Maybe it&#039;s my fragile ego, but I find that for me it&#039;s the better way to go.]]></description>
