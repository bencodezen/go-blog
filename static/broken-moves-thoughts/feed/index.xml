		<description><![CDATA[Haha. I think you bring up a great point Martin. To clarify though, I&#039;m not saying that correspondence games are bad though, it&#039;s just that it&#039;s not working out for me at the moment. =)
I think the comparison between younger and older minds is a perspective I hadn&#039;t quite given as much thought and will be sure to include when I write my overall review on correspondence games.
As always, thanks for your insight!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Since the topic came up on this very fine blog for a few times now I&#039;ll would like to add a point which the almost still youthfull blogger (Ben) naturally can&#039;t fully understand - at least not yet. ;-)
And that is that correspondance go is quite a good thing for older players like me. As probably anyone with ambitions to learn go knows younger players (kids, teenagers) learn and consequently play much better than older players. The reasons are of course neurological, older brains have more trouble to make new synapsis. And the very first field of thinking where all this mess starts is the fastness of thinking. This phenomen kicks in rather early in life. I&#039;m now &quot;only&quot; 38 but I don&#039;t think quite as fast as I did when I was in my twenties. Which means that short time limits like they are common on KGS tend to favor the younger player. A player who can easily crush me on a 15 minutes limit might have troubles holding his ground in a correspondance game. Therefor I think that - like correspondance chess - correspondance go is really good for people who learned the games as adults but still have some ambitions to at least sometimes win against some young ... eh ... well ... whatever. ;-)

		<description><![CDATA[I think you have a completely valid point. I think part of the difference in our approaches to correspondence games is the fact that I don&#039;t get to spend very much time on thinking about my moves for correspondence games. So it ends up being a 30 seconds or less decision for me oftentimes.
In regards to strategy, I do think that correspondence games helps to let ideas marinate over time and possibly reveal better moves with some time and distance.
And in all honesty, I think my post here was more directed to the idea of learning lessons and making mistakes quickly in the effort to gain strength as quickly as possible (which would be obviously be the antithesis to what correspondence games would allow). =)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[That&#039;s interesting, I&#039;ve had a very different experience with the two. Such is go (and life) =)
My correspondence Go is more refined than my in-person go. Partially it&#039;s having time to count and adjust strategy, or being able to let an open position simmer in the back of my mind.
I think I also have a tendency in realtime go to read out a sequence 5 moves, play that sequence to its end, then read a new sequence out. In correspondence go I&#039;m more likely to read a little further each move. So in correspondence, I&#039;m better at parrying threats rather than running straight into them and winning or losing based on a big semai.
I&#039;ve never had trouble hanging my strategic thoughts on a board. When I come back to a game after a day or two, and maybe a realtime game in between, it feels familiar and I still see the aji I had been eyeing, the big point I&#039;m struggling for sente to play...]]></description>
