		<description><![CDATA[That&#039;s a good point. I forgot that there was such a rank discrepancy when it came to Korean ranks versus KGS ranks. I haven&#039;t gotten a chance to check out the &quot;searching for exquisite moves&quot; yet, but I will definitely make it a higher priority on the list since you recommend it!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[though that&#039;s Korean 5kyu, which is a fair bit stronger than KGS 5 kyu - 1 kyu is the top Korean rank for an amateur, in case you don&#039;t know.  But yeah BadukTV is pretty good.  I especially liked the game review series &quot;searching for exquisite moves&quot; last time I was subscribed (and I will do again in the future).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks for letting me know! I&#039;ve heard a lot of things about him, but haven&#039;t had a chance to check him out. I&#039;m glad to get your consensus on him as well, so I will definitely have to check it out. =D]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Yes. They are scheduled to release at a minimum of 8 translated videos a month. This refers to videos that are translated via English subtitles (and not translated voice). In my experience so far, the quality of translations has been very good and it doesn&#039;t bother me that it&#039;s not orally translated.
In terms of the number of English subtitled videos that are on-demand, there are 100+ by my count, and the number is only growing!
Let me know if you have any more questions! Hope this helped!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[What do you use to stream to your TV?  I have a ps3, but I&#039;ve had problems getting it to work with videos from youtube (I know there&#039;s an ap of some sort, but it isn&#039;t available in Canada for some dumb reason), so I have no idea how well or conveniently it&#039;ll work with baduktv.  Anyway, I&#039;ve been thinking about baduktv for some time, and If I solve this issue, it&#039;s only a matter of time before I end up with a subscription myself; I don&#039;t think I could help myself.;)]]></description>
