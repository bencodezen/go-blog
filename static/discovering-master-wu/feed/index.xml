		<description><![CDATA[yeah, had similar experience tho I loved way back Xie He, Gu Li, both Lee and some jp masters, I replayed his games some years ago, but might be not that. Recently Iyama Yuta is the boss on my go board, cus his play style is similar to me, tho he read way deeper (deeper than deep) hehe
at this point I decided to go to shusaku commented games in invincyble, even if I dont get &quot;4d&quot; according to proverb, for sure gonna learn something, even tho my fuseki will be bad, but still it wont affect my gameplay overall, cause I always catch up from behind]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Agreed. And you have to remember that I&#039;ve been back and forth a lot on this too. I started with Lee Changho, then Lee Sedol for a little while, tried Go Seigen and then got discouraged, tried Shusaku, back to Lee Sedol, then Gu Li.... Haha. A lot of trial and error, but as long as you go step by step, you&#039;ll get there!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Wow. I had no idea so many people were Go Seigen disciples! Haha. That&#039;s great to hear that you could find your inspiration so early on!
And to answer your question, I got mine for $100USD believe it or not!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[For myself, whenever I study a bunch of games of some or another professional, whoever it may be, my play gets either sloppy or I don&#039;t enjoy/understand the game as much.  But, right when I study just one or two of Wu&#039;s games I am able to get a different understanding of the game, making my play feel way better, while at the same time making the game that much more enjoyable.  I don&#039;t know what it is with his style of play, but it is what I would like to imitate in the far far future.  :]  He has been the person I have looked up to since the very beginning of my first picking up the game of Go.
ps.  I have been leisurely looking for his games, and now I know where to find them.  Thanks!  His complete game records will be my first buy once I am done with all of Shusaku&#039;s games.  Good luck on your journey!
pss. How much does the series of books cost?  It is not available at the moment.  ($500ish?)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks! I&#039;ve always been a fan of him technically. Haha. But I&#039;ve finally realized that learning from him will be the core of my go. Just like other&#039;s study Shusaku to get stronger, I will study Go Seigen. =D]]></description>
