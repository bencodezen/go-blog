		<description><![CDATA[Very good point, but in my case, i think if i start to study mainly tesuji now i&#039;m &quot;building a house on sand&quot; because i&#039;m not yet happy enough with my L&#038;D skills ... if i have a solid ground in that , i will focus more in tesuji.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[No problem! To explain Sai&#039;s move, the whole idea is that prior to Sai&#039;s move, Black had a bit of territory in the center. However, Sai found the one move that could destroy Black&#039;s territory while avoiding capture. Hence it is a tesuji. Does that make sense?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[There&#039;s a use for life and death besides what you pointed out - it also lets you see when you can tenuki from an enclosed group. This is less flashy than killing a group, but every tenuki you don&#039;t play costs you a stone in strength.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Amen to that! And reading simply comes with practice. I know for me personally, it usually ends up with me getting obsessed with one tesuji like snapback. And then for a while all I&#039;m looking for is to see if there&#039;s a snapback somewhere. Eventually it becomes a lot easier to spot and I don&#039;t have to intentionally search it out anymore.
And to your point, I would agree that I would rather know that I convincingly out read my opponent than winning a game. Because in the end, in my experience, being able to read more consistently than your opponent will prove itself more valuable in the long run than simply &quot;winning a game.&quot;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Personally, I get excited when I can read something correctly, even if it doesn&#039;t successfully catch the opponent.  I&#039;m usually terrible at reading.  I once felt really good about a game I lost just because at one point I had seen a snapback a few moves ahead and it took my opponent a couple more moves to see it and adjust his play accordingly.]]></description>
