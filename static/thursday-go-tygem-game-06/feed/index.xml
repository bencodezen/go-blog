		<description><![CDATA[Thanks for the commentary! I do think that I need to be more careful about playing slack moves.
I mean something to keep in mind is that these games are a few weeks old. They don&#039;t line up with my current go studies (aka I played this game before starting to study Go Seigen). Haha.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[15 second line in fuseki is bad, C9/D10 is better
21 move of Black is greedy
32 would play D7 or F8 tho hard to say even H2 looks nice for me
41 would say you give to much white with it, I would close white in corner for more influence, its prolly personal style, would play q5/p5
63 seems small for me, even tho you gain teritory it doesnt feel like its important at all N2 seems more urgent there but left side is bigger
64 white I would play G8/D11
149 should be at k18
171 at B1
224 of black should be atari at E4 &#062; G2 &#062; E7 ;p try read that out ^^
But still that game was better than previous one for sure :)
ah one advice for Go Seigen games, learn from him, dont mimic, cause ure more terytorial freak than he was =P]]></description>
