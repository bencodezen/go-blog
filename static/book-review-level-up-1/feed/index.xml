		<description><![CDATA[Thank you for your input! I agree with you on the fact that I&#039;m completely sold on this series as well. Be wary of the Essential Life and Death one though, it can get super advanced very quickly. Good luck on your progression through them as well!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I was looking for a book set for my nephews as they are a bit far away and we only get to play every few weeks. Heard about this one and took a chance on it, bought the first few books. I read through the first and second and found it to be possibly perfect for their ages (3 and 6. The 6 year old on his own, the 3 year old via parents. That one might struggle a bit in life and death, but the kid LOVES his moyos). After reading into the book three, I started running into problems. There was stuff here I didn&#039;t know. This intrigued me. I opened four and was lost. From here I ordered the rest of the series for level up, jump level up, the reviews, and life and death. I have experienced before how things can go out of print right when you want them, so figured it worth the investment. It may take me five years to make it through these books, but wow.... I am sold on the series. The progression of concepts seems fluid and well designed. Yellow Mountain has a bundle deal on some of them bringing the price down to about 10 bucks per book.
Good luck!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve been curious about this serie but I don&#039;t really know where to start with it. I&#039;m currently teaching my 6 years old daughter how to play and I was looking for some books to help me get the right message across. Right now I&#039;m using some french books for this purpose (&quot;Le go: un jeu d&#039;enfant&quot;) but I&#039;m curious about books that could fill the same purpose with a focus on children (varying exercises and practice to keep their interest).]]></description>
