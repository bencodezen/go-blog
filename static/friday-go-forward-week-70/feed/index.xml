		<description><![CDATA[Glad to hear that my lesson learned is a relevant topic across the board! I know that I still have issues with it during games, but it was certainly a step forward to confront it and not let it bother me as much as it normally does.
Hope you had a good weekend as well!
PS. I would recommend you try posting on Life in 19x19 or the Reddit Baduk forum regarding heat maps. You might get a faster response that way!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The &#039;Lesson Learned&#039; here I think is huge, Ben. At least coming from the amateur chess world I can tell you that players &#039;psyching themselves out&#039; is very, very common. It is one thing to play or evaluate by instinct (usually OK) and another thing to ride an emotional roller coaster during a game (always not OK).
This is not really on topic (sorry) but perhaps Ben or someone knows: I saw a website some time back with Go &#039;heatmaps.&#039; I thought it was an intriguing idea. But now I cannot find it. :( Anyone?
I hope your weekend is good, Ben.]]></description>
