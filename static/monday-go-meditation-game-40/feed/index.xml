		<description><![CDATA[While you may think that, I wouldn&#039;t be surprised if you were actually stronger than him. I&#039;ve seen dan players review 1k games and ask them why they were making 9k moves. xD Haha. But regardless, I hope that this was interesting and valuable to you!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[To be honest, I don&#039;t know. I think that&#039;s one of the major flaws with OGS. You just don&#039;t know what kind of rank you&#039;ll actually be playing against. It kind of messes with the game a bit in my opinion.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I say that because I sometimes beat people 5+ ranks above me just because they&#039;re unprepared for my stupidity and overthink their moves.  So I think sometimes people don&#039;t realize how dumb their opponents are.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I think w42 is an example of a thank-you move: it invites black to play what he would want to anyway (B10) *in sente*. Why not just ignore? Black keeps the left side either way - it&#039;s just a question of some points. Your corner was solid - you weren&#039;t going to die.]]></description>
