		<description><![CDATA[Oh okay. So for your suggestion for Move 73 (Black) to be played at L5 instead is a good idea in terms of trying to reduce the bottom. The only thing that you risk though is coming under attack and then giving White enough strength to harass the E4 group later on. But definitely not a bad idea if you&#039;re trying to complicate things and catch up. =)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Move 27 (J5 Move) - This is an attempt to shoulder hit on the fourth line. White will either take nice profit, or since Black is weak, White will most likely just push up and split Black and create two weak groups for Black to take care of (where one will most likely die). So J5 is not really a running move.
Move 92 (Wedge) - So you are correct. He could atari from the opposite side and protect his potential territory, but you have to consider what White is getting in return (aka 5th line territory). The potential territory Black has in the center is very minimal and is not enough to try and reverse the game, which is why the atari (in the actual game) is correct since it shows an attempt to fight back. So in reality, Black gains a couple points this way. Granted, White does end up reducing the center like crazy, but you have to remember that this is one of the hardest parts of trying to surround center territory. =)
Does that help?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Great game! I enjoy the commentary. At move 27, wouldn&#039;t J5 be a good escaping move while putting pressure on the stone? Also, at move 72, wouldn&#039;t a move at the L5 are also be good? My last question is in regards to the wedge that you played at move 92. If he had ataried from the other side, then he would be able to protect his potential territory right? So why is E14 the right side? The sequence I&#039;m seeing is WF14, BG14, WE14, BL12. Is that good?]]></description>
