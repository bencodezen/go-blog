		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m glad that you brought this up Marek. I&#039;ve uploaded the respective games to both posts and will be sure to keep that in mind for future ones as well.
No worries about having limited time, as long as you are studying bits here and there, it will all add up in the future. Ganbatte!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[That would be scary, but exciting at the same time. I would definitely love to study in China or Korea sometime. That would be an awesome experience!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[sounds like u need minecraft a bit hehe, build tower from sand and on center ocean then take 2 stones from bottom and see how it fall beautifully to became something new there ^^
Put it on different perspective, You can play, and You arent afraid to play, thats most important thing, I still fighting with my will to play a game.
Yesterday I had nightmare, I went to China, not sure what for, maybe train go or something, but I went to weiqi club, and I got asked to play a game, guess what? I woke up, with desire to run away, and I was much more scared than ever..]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi,
yes I think there is such interest. I mean on one side, you are sharing here not just some plain factual data like news at 7pm in the evening, but also your thoughts, progress, etc. you somehow open your mind to those willing to listen. and for those it definitely helps, if you put the game online too, you are talking about. as I told, I now have my time very limited, but... if I see a game of yours, I always at lease browse it, just to get the glimpse of game flow.
so ... cheer up ;)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I believe you to be correct. That was my experience in chess; your mind is digesting gains, the subconscious is trying to get through, you fight it and start losing. Most chess players will tell you the same thing, even those at the  top.
Still, were I Ben I&#039;d take some time off, do something different for a week.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Good point. I did not know if it would be of interest of people to see the game, but you are right in that it helps to give context if I post the games. I will be sure to update the posts with the respective games. Thanks for the advice!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Easier said than done. Haha. I do try and enjoy myself during the game, but it is often washed away by the final result at the end. After all, it&#039;s kind of like building a tower and having it fall into pieces at the end. It might be fun during, but seeing your failed project tends to make you quickly forget about the previous enjoyment.
I definitely heed the advice of training both mind and body seriously. So although it would be great if that is the issue, I know that I haven&#039;t been really slacking off in my physical training.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[You&#039;re probably right. Hopefully I can unwind quickly since Yunguseng Dojang matches go on every week. When it&#039;s all said and done, perhaps I will take a week or so to simply allow things to digest.]]></description>
