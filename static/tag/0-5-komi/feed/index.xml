				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It&#8217;s been awhile since I last posted a kifu on here, and for my first KGS game post for 2013, it is only fitting that I post this one.<br />
To give some background to this game, it&#8217;s been about five weeks since my friend Nate and I had the opportunity to play one another. So the anticipation of the game was making me a little bit nervous since I&#8217;m quite sure that he&#8217;s stronger than his KGS rank. Nonetheless, I was excited at the opportunity to finally get to start the new year properly with a game with him.<br />
This game was a magnificent show of tenacity and fierce fighting spirit from both players (if I may say so). Both of us were unrelenting in trying to stay ahead and find a way to conclude the game in his favor. It took a whopping 1.5 hours, which was more than either of us was probably anticipating; but what an intense and awesome 1.5 hours.<br />
In regards to the blog post title, I felt like Go Seigen at certain points of the game because I was like, &#8220;Twenty points? Was that supposed to be mine? No matter! Here! Take it! Let me show you how that will dwarf in comparison to my attack!&#8221; On the other hand, this game is a mega-fail for me because of the fact that I lost my tenacity in the final move and failed to realize that the game was actually one move away from victory.<br />
I hope that you enjoy one of my craziest games to date.<br />
