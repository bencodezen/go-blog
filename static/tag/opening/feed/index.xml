[expand title=&#8221;My Review&#8221; trigclass=&#8221;expandTitle&#8221; expanded=&#8221;true&#8221;]
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p><em>The Basic Principles of the Opening and the Middle Game</em>, by Rob can Zeijst and Richard Bozulich, is the second volume to Kiseido’s new series: The Road Map to Shodan. Though the title might lead some astray, this book is not intended to be a definitive guide to all principles in regards to the opening and middle game. Instead, it would be more accurate to view the purpose of this book as a broad survey of common principles that beginner and intermediate players forget during their own games. And while some might write this book off as a simple marketing ploy, this book is truly a fantastic collection of principles that cover a wide range of material in an easy to understand manner.</p>
<h3>Summary of Content</h3>
<p>When first presented with the title, I must admit that I was initially skeptical of what it could contain. After all, I had already read 20 Principles of the Opening, Get Strong at the Opening, 501 Opening Problems, etc. To my delight, the content of the book exceeded my expectations. Just look at the topics covered: (1) Extensions and Efficiency, (2) Confinement, Linkage, and Separation, (3) Weak Stones and Weak Positions, (4) Handling Moyos &amp; Escaping, (5) Handling Thickness, (6) The Third and Fourth Lines in the Opening, (7) Defending Against a 3-3 Invasion, (8) Turning a Moyo into Territory, and (9) How to Make Sabaki.<br />
While the topics do not receive a comprehensive explanation of each topic, the book does a great job providing a survey of the topic with the key points highlighted. After all, don’t forget that this series is meant to be a guide for those who are kyu players looking to gain strength. So the most effective method for helping players do that is to provide the most common mistakes that players make and how to fix them. More advanced techniques and principles would naturally be reserved for other books.<br />
Unlike most of the other books I have read, this book does an excellent job of keeping things as simple as possible. For example, instead of inundating the reader with numerous of examples taken from professional games, the examples consist of straight-forward examples that are easy to follow. In addition, each principle is given a good mixture of examples and explanation. As a result, novice and/or more casual players would not be overwhelmed and can digest the material much more easily.</p>
<h3>Intended Audience</h3>
<p>The strength of players who would benefit most from this book would be around 10k and stronger.<br />
While there are other books out there that contain similar information in various forms, this book is best suited for players who approach the study of go with a more casual approach.<br />
In other words, the material is written in such a way that it is quite easy to get through and absorb without multiple intense readings. That’s not to say that you can read it once and be done with it, but it is not so dense that you would have to reread a paragraph multiple times just to understand its basic meaning (let alone trying to apply it in your own games). In addition, the diagrams are short enough that it is not necessary to have a board in order to comprehend the flow of the stones (though it is certainly recommended if you have it in front of you).</p>
<h3>Layout</h3>
<p>The content is laid out in a way that is analogous to a textbook. First you have a section explaining the principles that you should learn along with a few examples to illustrate their point. The explanations are then followed up with a few problems for you to reinforce what you have just learned. And to ensure that you don’t accidentally glance at the solutions while trying to solve the problems, they are kept in a separate section after the problems are presented.</p>
<h3>Analysis and Evaluation</h3>
<p>The key to understanding the brilliance of this book lies in its accessibility to players of all kinds. Even when I consider players like myself who have read numerous books and take the game quite seriously, there is something to be appreciated about the simplicity to which this book approaches the topic. And though my understanding of this topic most likely has already encroached on dan territory, I still felt that the book provided a great reinforcement of things I knew and helped fill some areas that I didn’t realize were missing.<br />
In terms of shortcomings, there is only one aspect that I would have liked to have seen: more practice problems. While there are a handful of problems to review each section, there was more than one occasion where I would have liked just a few more problems. To be clear though, this is not to say that the problems in the book do not cover the topics presented. It’s just I would have liked a few more than what is in the book.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>While there will be players who may scoff at this book, Kiseido has done a great job of finally providing a stepping stone that beginner and intermediate players can actually benefit from. So if you have any interest in the topics mentioned above and think you could benefit from the style of teaching being used, then I highly recommend that you get a copy of this book pronto!<br />

[expand title=&#8221;Before I Read This Book&#8230;&#8221; trigclass=&#8221;expandTitle&#8221;]
I bought this book way back when I started go. I felt like I was completely lost when I first tried to read it, so here I am a couple years later trying to read it once more. What I was expecting when I bought it was a book on a broad coverage of techniques one would find with go. Now that I am much stronger and more experienced, I am still hoping for a survey of techniques along with clarification on their usage.<br />
[/expand]
[expand title=&#8221;My Review&#8221; trigclass=&#8221;expandTitle&#8221; expanded=&#8221;true&#8221;]
When I first opened this book, I was a little surprised to be greeted by a chapter on opening theory. After all, this is a book on technique is it not? I recognize that selecting the correct opening move is a &#8220;technique&#8221; in a sense, but in my mind I was thinking more along the lines of haengma (i.e., the movement of the stones) or something else.<br />
With that aside though, the first chapter does cover quite a bit regarding the opening. While this is good in one sense, I still found it to be a bit dense and cannot imagine any beginner trying to work through this and achieve much success.<br />
And the next thing I know, the book is going full blown into handicap go coverage. All I could think when I kept reading was, &#8220;EH?!&#8221; I understand that these handicap go principles and techniques being described might seem &#8220;basic,&#8221; but even as a single digit kyu, even I was raising my eyebrows as I was trying to figure out what was going on. The diagrams were often rather complicated and required multiple readings just to get a sense of what was going on. After you work through a rather substantial amount of handicap go material, you finally get to the tesuji section.<br />
Here, I finally got a sense of what I was hoping for. A broad survey of different techniques used in different situations. With each tesuji, there is a brief explanation along with an example and an obvious variation or two that players might question. So while some of the material in here was a bit advanced and hard to grasp based on simple reading, this felt more like the book I was looking for when purchasing this book. And for those wondering about the problems, they are overall intermediate level and not very beginner friendly.<br />
For the last chapter, the reader is introduced to the importance of endgame. And while I would consider myself to at least be moderately versed when it comes to endgame, this was a rather tough section for me to work through. I can only imagine what it would be like for someone who had little to no exposure on endgame. Definitely not an easy chapter at all.<br />
Overall, I would divide the book into the following categories: 10% Opening Principles, 40% Handicap Go, 30% Tesuji, and 20% Endgame. And as such, I find that it is not quite aptly named as &#8220;Basic Techniques of Go&#8221; since there was far more handicap go than I think is appropriate for beginners. And not to mention, what about life and death? That deserves attention in here as well if it is going to be titled &#8220;Basic Techniques of Go.&#8221;<br />
In regards to its overall difficulty, it really does feel as if the reader needs to already have a decent grasp of the material in order to truly understand and digest the contents of this book. To be clear though, I am by no means saying that the content in this book is bad. Quite the contrary in fact, there is a lot of information considering how short the book is. It&#8217;s just that its rather dense for beginner/intermediate players.<br />
So if you fall into the category of beginner/intermediate players looking to get stronger, I do not recommend this book for you. Instead, I recommend checking out the Mastering the Basics series from Kiseido as a better alternative.<br />
[/expand]
[expand title=&#8221;Synopsis&#8221; trigclass=&#8221;expandTitle&#8221;]
<strong>What did I enjoy about the book?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>There is a lot of information on handicap go.</li>
<li>They did do a pretty nice job surveying some common tesuji.</li>
<li>There were problems to accompany the tesuji and endgame section.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What did I gain from reading this book?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Due to the dense material, I can&#8217;t say I really gained anything from this first reading.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What aspect(s) can be improved on?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>In all honesty, I don&#8217;t feel that it would be very fair for me to criticize the book at the moment since I feel that its content is generally out of reach for me. The one thing I will say is that the title is a little misleading to the unsuspecting player. Otherwise, I will save my comments for when I am able to better comprehend the book.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Is this book easy to read?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>As a mid to high single digit kyu, I felt that it was rather difficult to read due to the level of discussion that occurred in the book. However, if one could easily follow the level of content in this book, the English is rather straightforward and should be pretty easy to work through.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Bottom Line</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Content is essentially 10% opening principles, 40% handicap go, 30% tesuji, and 20% endgame.</li>
<li>Better suited to players already familiar with the content in the book. In other words, NOT for beginners.</li>
<li>If you&#8217;re a beginner/intermediate player looking to get stronger, check out the Mastering Basics series instead.</li>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Earlier today, I was reading <em>Otake&#8217;s Secrets of Strategy</em> by Hideo Otake 9P when I stumbled upon an interesting quote:</p>
<blockquote><p>In the opening there are no predetermined shapes. &#8211; Otake 9P</p></blockquote>
<p>I know that it might seem terribly obvious to some of you, but it struck me as rather profound when I read it.<br />
Otake was discussing the fact that many amateur players play joseki faithfully believing that since they are joseki it can&#8217;t be that bad. He considers this a huge flaw with our rationale because joseki are only as good as the position it was meant to be used in. So when he said that &#8220;there are no predetermined shapes&#8221; in the opening, it opened my eyes as to how unimaginative I have been with my openings lately.<br />
Perhaps this quote will cause me to start playing some very odd experimental games where I lose and drop rank; but if it means that I&#8217;m developing my own creative style as I play, I have a feeling it will be an enjoyable journey: win or lose.</p>

<strong>My Abilities</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A mid-high SDK (single digit kyu) who has read his fair share of books and has a decent foundation of most areas in go.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>My Perspective</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Since these are written to be more of a &#8220;workshop&#8221; format, I was looking forward to a new style of writing along with a refreshing perspective on some common questions that most players might have.</li>
</ul>
[/expand]
[expand title=&#8221;Synopsis&#8221; trigclass=&#8221;expandTitle&#8221;]
<strong>What did I enjoy about the book?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>As usual, Yang continues to breakdown topics into simple explanations that I could easily understand.</li>
<li>I really enjoy the fact that he takes on topics that go literature tends to overlook for amateurs. An example of this is &#8220;Handling Unusual Opening Moves.&#8221;</li>
<li>The diagrams are short and quite easy to follow.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What did I gain from reading this book?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Improved ability to recognize what areas on the board are important and big.</li>
<li>Better understanding of how to determine what my next move should be in the opening.</li>
<li>Much clearer direction in regards to how one should handle unusual opening moves.</li>
<li>An improved grasp on how I should protect my positions on the board.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What style of teaching does the book use?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Similar to his previous books in this series, the teaching format primarily consists of explanations regarding the topic at hand in conjunction with diagrams that have the reader test his/her ability. Then, after the problem is given, Yang typically goes into an extensive (but simple to understand) explanation of the various things the reader should consider when approaching the problem.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What aspect can be improved on?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>No complaints from me!</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Is this book easy to read?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Yes. The explanations are concise and the accompanying diagrams are often no more than a few moves long.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Bottom Line</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Breaks down topics into easy to understand explanations.</li>
<li>Has a lot of valuable content for such a short book!</li>
<li>Worth every penny you spend on it!</li>
</ol>

[expand title=&#8221;My Review&#8221; trigclass=&#8221;expandTitle&#8221; expanded=&#8221;true&#8221;]
The topics that are covered in this book are incredibly useful to many players (particularly kyu level players). Though I am still far from being able to implement his advice flawlessly, I am still blown away by Yang&#8217;s ability to take common topics that plague weaker players and convey them in a manner that we can understand without boring us to death. So if you have any interest in the topics covered in this volume, be sure to pick up a copy!<br />

<li>Players who are 10 kyu or stronger.</li>

<strong>What did I enjoy about the book?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>As usual, Yang continues to breakdown topics into simple explanations that I could easily understand.</li>
<li>The topics are extremely relevant to the average player since a majority of go literature assumes that the reader is already familiar and well versed in these basic concepts.</li>
<li>Yang usually has a checklist of questions for each section to remind the reader of the important things to remember.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What did I gain from reading this book?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A much better understanding of how to evaluate whether a group is weak or not.</li>
<li>Better grasp on what forcing moves are. Though applying it is still rather hazy for me.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What style of teaching does the book use?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Workshop Format
<ul>
<li>Topics of broken down into its simplest format and represents more of an outline than a thorough textbook.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Primary Learning Mechanism:
<ul>
<li>Explanations with accompanying diagrams</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Other Learning Mechanisms:
<ul>
<li>Practice problems</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What aspect can be improved on?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Though the examples can be helpful, I found that they slightly overwhelming after some time since I am still having issues actually understanding the concept solidly. A good example of this is whether or not a forcing move is good or bad. I have a general idea, but that&#8217;s all. So before I get into the weeds of how to use it, it would have been better to have more basic practice questions.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Is this book easy to read?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Yes. The explanations are concise and the accompanying diagrams are often no more than a few moves long.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Bottom Line</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Breaks down topics into really easy to understand explanations.</li>
<li>Has a lot of valuable content for such a short book!</li>
<li>Worth every penny you spend on it!</li>

[expand title=&#8221;My Review&#8221; trigclass=&#8221;expandTitle&#8221; expanded=&#8221;true&#8221;]
In this volume, I found that the sections on the opening were a little harder to grasp. This is probably due to the fact that the nature of the opening is rather vast and thus trying to condense it down into a few pages is rather difficult. The forcing move section was also a little bit tough for me to really grab hold of as well. I imagine this is due to the fact that the whole concept of &#8220;timing&#8221; in go is not so easily summed up in a few pages. On the other hand though, I was very impressed by the sections regarding weak groups. And in my opinion, those two sections make the entire book worth purchasing.<br />

<strong>My Abilities</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>I&#8217;ve read a fair number of books on the opening, so I feel decently comfortable with my opening abilities; but still not very confident in them.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>My Perspective</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>I was hoping that this book would help to clarify some of my misconceptions and boost my confidence in my opening abilities.</li>
</ul>
[/expand]
[expand title=&#8221;Synopsis&#8221; trigclass=&#8221;expandTitle&#8221;]
<strong>What did I enjoy about the book?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Covers four very popular fuseki: Chinese (high and low), ninren-sei, sanren-sei, and the Shusaku opening.</li>
<li>The problems are realistic and really help the reader to work through the process of where the best response really is, especially when you consider the purpose of each fuseki.</li>
<li>The problems build on themselves as you progres through the book. This helps to maintain continuity of what is being learned and is really helpful.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What did I gain from reading this book?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>An increased awareness for how to interpet the board position during the opening.</li>
<li>Greater sensitivity to weak groups and how to handle them.</li>
<li>Higher comfort level when it comes to the opening.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What style of teaching does the book use?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Drill Seargent Style
<ul>
<li>Once you get your direction, it&#8217;s do or die as you attempt to pick the right answer!</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Primary Learning Mechanism:
<ul>
<li>Practice Problems</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Other Learning Mechanisms:
<ul>
<li>Short introduction to the fusekis used in the book.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What aspects can be improved on?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Trivial request: It would be cool to see problems on the Orthodox fuseki.</li>
<li>I know this is due to book size constraints, but it would have been cool to see explanations for why every other options (in the multiple choice problems) are considered &#8220;failures&#8221; to the correct answer.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Is this book easy to read?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Yes. All the diagrams are only a few moves long and not to mention the explanations are all concise and only a paragraph long tops.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Bottom Line</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Covers situations that generally arise from typical openings from popular fuseki (e.g., Chinese, sanren-sei, etc.).</li>
<li>A fantastic introductory/intermediate level book with practice problems on the opening.</li>
<li>A must have for anyone looking to strengthen their understanding of the opening.</li>
</ol>
[/expand]
[expand title=&#8221;My Review&#8221; trigclass=&#8221;expandTitle&#8221; expanded=&#8221;true&#8221;]
Though this book has been sitting on my shelf for quite some time, I must admit that I am so glad that I finally got around to it. The way that Bozulich forces the reader to consider different board positions at different points of the opening was really eye opening. I would say that I would get the answer right about 40-50% of the time, but oftentimes when I was wrong my eyes were opened up to a whole new concept. So while it was great to be right at times, I found the explanations to be extremely valuable in teaching me something new.<br />
Granted, I look forward to the day where I can go through this book again and get everything correct without any effort at all; but until that day comes, this book will definitely remain a classic when it comes to providing excellent quality problems for the opening along with fantastic explanations.<br />
[/expand]

<li>Players with some basic knowledge of the opening who want to gain more familiarity with proper moves in the opening.</li>
<li>Players who want to get a better understanding of how to interpret the board position.</li>

<li>A significant increase in my comfort to tenuki in the opening.</li>

</ul>
<p><strong>What style of teaching does the book use?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Workshop Format

<strong>My Abilities</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A mid-high SDK (single digit kyu) who has read his fair share of books and has a decent foundation of most areas in go.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>My Perspective</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Since these are written to be more of a &#8220;workshop&#8221; format, I was looking forward to a new style of writing along with a refreshing perspective on some common questions that most players might have.</li>
</ul>
[/expand]
[expand title=&#8221;My Review&#8221; trigclass=&#8221;expandTitle&#8221; expanded=&#8221;true&#8221;]
This was a refreshing perspective on common go questions. Yilun Yang&#8217;s ability to break down popular topics like &#8220;Determining What Direction to Attack&#8221; was incredibly easy to understand. Contrary to some typical go literature where the concept is explained to death, Yang provides more of a road map on how to actually apply the principle instead of simply understanding it. Now granted, I will be the first to say that actually applying it to your game is not so easy; but my understanding has certainly grown and I am now trying out new things as a result. I am really looking forward to the next books in the series!<br />

[expand title=&#8221;Before I Read This Book&#8230;&#8221; trigclass=&#8221;expandTitle&#8221;]
<strong>My Abilities</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>I had little to no understanding of direction of play. I had heard the term used a lot in my reviews, but my understanding of it was practically nonexistent and any proper application of direction of play was usually just due to sheer luck. Although in my defense, I did have a moderate understanding of whole board thinking which would provide a good stepping stone to understanding this book.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>My Perspective</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Since I was going pretty much blind into the subject, I was really hoping to gain a good grasp on direction of play and be able to apply it when I was finished with the book.</li>
</ul>
[/expand]
[expand title=&#8221;My Review&#8221; trigclass=&#8221;expandTitle&#8221; expanded=&#8221;true&#8221;]
<strong>What did I enjoy about the book?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Direction of play is broken down into very simple components that make it easier for the reader to follow.</li>
<li>Kajiwara&#8217;s writing style makes for an entertaining read and helps make the lesson more memorable.</li>
<li>Although it is rather advanced and kind of went over my head, the book even goes into an explanation on how direction of play impacts fighting in a game.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What did I gain from reading this book?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A much better understanding of direction of play.</li>
<li>Though far from perfect, my ability to apply direction of play in my games has greatly improved.</li>
<li>A much greater appreciation for how important the opening and fuseki is in a game.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What style of teaching does the book use?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Lecture Approach
<ul>
<li>While there are numerous diagrams to try and illustrate the Kajiwara&#8217;s point, the gold mine of information in this book lies in his explanations and opinions about direction of play.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Primary Learning Mechanism:
<ul>
<li>Explanations with diagrams.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Other Learning Mechanisms:
<ul>
<li>Examples from actual games</li>
<li>Practice problems</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What aspect(s) can be improved on?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>While I loved the explanations and accompanying diagrams, it would have been great to have more practice problems.</li>
<li>Introductory problems that utilize the multiple choice format would also be nice for people new to direction of play.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Is this book easy to read?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Yes. Although not as entertaining as Kageyama&#8217;s writing style, Kajiwara&#8217;s writing style was still fun to read and really helped to make me feel comfortable with a topic that was once completely foreign to me.</li>
</ul>
[/expand]
[expand title=&#8221;Recommended For&#8230;&#8221; trigclass=&#8221;expandTitle&#8221;]
<ul>
<li>Players looking to learn more about direction of play, even if only to simply be exposed to its concepts.</li>
<li>A basic understanding of the opening and whole board thinking is recommended to really appreciate the book as a whole, but this should not be a deterrent since this is a book that players will read multiple times in their journey as a go player.</li>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Overall Rating: 8 / 10 Ponnuki</h2>
<h3>Basic Information</h3>

<h3>Synopsis</h3>
<ul>
<li>A great introductory book to the Chinese Opening.</li>
<li>Explanations are kept at a high level and thus allows for easy reading.</li>
<li>Appropriate for 10 kyu and stronger.</li>
<li>Recommended for serious players.</li>
</ul>
<p><span id="more-2875"></span></p>
<h3>What I Expected</h3>
<ul>
<li><span style="line-height: 13px;">An overview of the Chinese Opening that is easy to read and understand as long as there is some basic understanding of the opening.</span></li>
<li>Explanations of common approaches/responses to various responses to the Chinese Opening.</li>
</ul>
<h3>What You Can Expect</h3>
<ul>
<li>A nice and concise introduction to how the Chinese Opening grew to the popularity it receives today.</li>
<li>A clear and concise explanation as to why the high Chinese Opening fell out of popularity.</li>
<li>A good explanation for the ideal development and direction fro the Chinese Opening.</li>
<li>A [reprinted] article from Go Seigen on the Chinese Opening!</li>
<li>Over ten kifus for players to play through (although only parts of each game are utilized for commentary in the book while the rest is simply a kifu).</li>
</ul>
<h3>My Thoughts as 5 Kyu</h3>
<p>As someone who has studied the Chinese Opening rather extensively (at least from an amateur perspective), <span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Chinese Opening</span> by Yuan Zhou is a fantastic introduction to the fuseki.<br />
When purchasing this book, the key thing to understand is that this is an <em>introductory</em> book on the Chinese Opening. It&#8217;s main purpose is to introduce big concepts regarding the Chinese Opening in order to give players a broad understanding of how they should approach it. In addition, Zhou does an excellent job  illustrating how the Chinese Opening can be used by various styles of play: attacking, territorial, etc.<br />
Some of the areas it does not go extensively into include topics such as: how to respond when the opponent interrupts the Chinese Opening, different josekis and the reason for why one is better than another when considering the Chinese Opening, etc.<br />
Now of course, there is the question as to whether someone should simply purchase <a title="Book Review: The Chinese Opening (Kato)" href="//book-review-the-chinese-opening-kato/">Kato&#8217;s book</a> on the Chinese Opening instead.<br />
To put it simply, if your goal is to devote yourself solely to the Chinese Opening so that you can master it and use it to your heart&#8217;s content, then I would recommend going straight to <a title="Book Review: The Chinese Opening (Kato)" href="//book-review-the-chinese-opening-kato/">Kato&#8217;s book</a>. On the other hand, if your goal is to simply gain a better understanding of the Chinese Opening so you can counter it more effectively or use it occasionally in your games, then Zhou&#8217;s book is the one for you.</p>

<h3>Basic Information</h3>

<h3>Synopsis</h3>
<ul>
<li>An in-depth explanation of the Chinese fuseki.</li>
<li>Covers a lot of various scenarios that players might encounter when trying to play the Chinese fuseki.</li>
<li>Appropriate for 8 kyu and stronger.</li>
<li>Recommended for serious players.</li>
</ul>
<p><span id="more-2799"></span></p>
<h3>What I Expected</h3>
<ul>
<li><span style="line-height: 13px;">A thorough explanation of the purpose and goal behind the Chinese opening.</span></li>
<li>Explanation of what happens when someone tries to interrupt the Chinese opening.</li>
<li>Examples of how the Chinese fuseki is used in different situations.</li>
</ul>
<h3>What You Can Expect</h3>
<ul>
<li><span style="line-height: 13px;">Everything I mentioned above plus&#8230;</span></li>
<li>Much more detailed explanation behind the purpose of individual aspects of the Chinese opening (e.g., How to respond when your opponent approaches the star point stone as opposed to the 3-4 stone of the Chinese opening).</li>
<li>How to handle building and destroying the large frameworks that can often result from peaceful games with the Chinese opening.</li>
</ul>
<h3>My Thoughts as a 5 Kyu</h3>
<p>As the first book I read on the Chinese opening, I was very pleased with the scope and breadth that Kato covers with this book. Although it seems rather short, Kato does a fantastic job starting from the very basics of the Chinese opening to small details that are very case specific. In addition, Kato covers a number of variations for each scenarios that helps to answer a lot of questions people might have as to why one result is better than another.<br />
While this book can read like a textbook and is difficult to fully absorb after only a single reading, I think it is a fantastic reference and would recommend it to any players who are serious about <em>studying</em> the Chinese fuseki.</p>
