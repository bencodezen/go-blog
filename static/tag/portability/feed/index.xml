<h2 style="text-align: center;">Go Bowls and Stones Carrying Bag</h2>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Overall Rating: 8 / 10 Ponnuki</h2>
<h3>Important Notice</h3>
<p>This review is based on the bag that I received two years ago. Since then, <a href="http://www.ymimports.com/">YMImports</a> has upgraded the carrying bag to also include bowl straps as well. With that new feature, the bag&#8217;s review would escalate to a 9 or 10 Ponnuki status.</p>
<h3>Highlights</h3>
<ul>
<li>Best carrying bag for go stones and bowls that I&#8217;ve seen on the market.</li>
<li>The bag is made of durable material that hasn&#8217;t shown signs of ripping.</li>
<li>The handles are a little more fragile, so be a little more careful relying on those.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Product Details</h3>
<ul>
<li>Travel vinyl bag with two handles and a single zipper for the top.</li>
<li>Fits standard Go bowls up to 5&#8221; wide and 4&#8221; high</li>
</ul>

<h3>Detailed Review</h3>
<p>In my constant search for better go equipment, this bag is one of the few that I&#8217;ve seen that combines the desired functionality of providing a travel case for your stones and bowls while looking great and at a fantastic price.<br />
<strong>Size &amp; Weight:</strong> The stones have a solid weight to them that gives a great feeling when picking each one up and placing it on the board. They fit very well on the Shin-Kaya Board that I purchased, but keep in mind that each  board is unique in what their max stone size is.<br />
<strong>Durability:</strong> I am not transporting my stones every day, but in the last two years I&#8217;ve used them, I have seen very little wear and tear. My only real critique is that the handles seem a little bit more flimsy that I would like. However, I really can&#8217;t speak for the handles since I rarely use them due to being paranoid for the safety of my bowls and stones; but on the few times that I&#8217;ve used them, they hold up quite well.<br />
<strong>Usability:</strong> In addition to its expected use as a carrying bag, it also functions really well as a protective case for your bowls and stones in the event you need to store them away for whatever reason.<br />
In all honesty, this is a purchase I consider mandatory for anyone looking to purchase go stones and bowls. You will not regret making this purchase (especially with the new updated bowl straps).</p>
