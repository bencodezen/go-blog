So it seems that even though a lot of time has passed, my rank on KGS still seems to be the same as when I left. It&#8217;s not so much that I&#8217;m slightly concerned that time has not marinated my abilities or anything, but maybe I just need to give it more time.<br />
It seems that my playing lately has been extremely centered on fighting. Kill. Kill Kill. I feel as if the empty triangle devil is much stronger than the angel. Haha.<br />
In order to see whether my hypothesis on my self-destructive tendencies in go hold true, I will be adhering to the following three principles:</p>
<ol>
<li>Unless I am playing someone I know or am challenged by someone, I will no longer go out to play random online ranked games for the sake of playing.</li>
<li>I will now focus on my patience in the game by training through absolute reading for every single go problem I do.</li>
<li>If I am playing a game, I will read at least 3 moves ahead and determine whether or not the board position is favorable to myself before simply jumping in on impulse.</li>
</ol>
<p>Let&#8217;s see how this goes&#8230;</p>
