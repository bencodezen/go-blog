<ol>
<li>Though it may seem like a book about joseki, I feel it&#8217;s more of a book about understanding whole board thinking.</li>
<li>Offers a great opportunity to practice whole board thinking while getting a better understanding of why one move is better or worse in different positions.</li>
<li>Very easy to read and work through.</li>

[expand title=&#8221;Before I Read This Book&#8230;&#8221; trigclass=&#8221;expandTitle&#8221;]
<strong>My Abilities</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Although I&#8217;ve had some exposure to joseki, I have avoided studying them like the plague. I really, really don&#8217;t like studying joseki.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>My Perspective</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Though I was skeptical of the book due to seeing the work joseki, I had heard a lot of good things about this book. In addition, since I was interested in trying to learn more about whole board thinking, I thought this book might be interesting to check out.</li>
</ul>
[/expand]
[expand title=&#8221;My Review&#8221; trigclass=&#8221;expandTitle&#8221; expanded=&#8221;true&#8221;]
<strong>What did I enjoy about the book?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The problems use a multiple choice format to help players like me who don&#8217;t know any joseki.</li>
<li>There are clear and easy to understand explanations for every answer choice that allows the reader to compare and contrast why the correct answer is better than the others.</li>
<li>The problems and solution diagrams are put on completely different pages to prevent the player from accidentally seeing the solution.</li>
<li>The layout of the book was very easy to read. Each section is clearly defined and the book is not cluttered at all.</li>
<li>Though the book seems to be centered on joseki, this seems more like a book on whole board thinking than anything else.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What did I gain from reading this book?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Improved understanding of how certain moves work with the board as a whole.</li>
<li>Reduction in kyu tunnel vision since I have more practice considering the whole board position.</li>
<li>Slightly better understanding of joseki patterns for the 3-4 point, low kakari.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What style of teaching does the book use?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Off the Cliff Style
<ul>
<li>There is no gradual progression into the material.</li>
<li>You learn through trial and error as you progress through the book.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Primary Learning Mechanism:
<ul>
<li>Multiple choice practice problems.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Other Learning Mechanisms:
<ul>
<li>Clear and concise explanations with an accompanying diagram to illustrate his point.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What aspect can be improved on?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>I wish there were more problems! =D But in all seriousness, this book is amazing as it stands. Top notch!</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Is this book easy to read?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Absolutely. The explanations are no longer than a paragraph long and are very clear and concise.</li>
</ul>

[expandsub1 title=&#8221;38 Basic Joseki&#8221; trigclass=&#8221;cBookTitle&#8221;]
<a title="Book Review: 38 Basic Joseki" href="//book-review-38-basic-joseki/">38 Basic Joseki</a>, like most joseki books, actually focuses on teaching the reader about the various sequences from joseki. There is some mention of how they affect the board as a whole, but there is a lack of illustration as to how it is truly impacted. Whole Board Thinking in Joseki, on the other hand, does a perfect job filling this gap.<br />
