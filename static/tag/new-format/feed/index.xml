So it&#8217;s official. I&#8217;ve joined the <a title="Canadian Go League" href="http://members.go-canada.org/League">Canadian Go League</a> and will be participating in their Round 13-5! For those wondering what it is, it&#8217;s essentially an online tournament that is played using KGS and is completely free to participate in! They seem to have a wide range of players and have also done a great job breaking players up into appropriate divisions.<br />
As I look at the roster, there are quite a few familiar names; but unfortunately we are all in different divisions. I&#8217;m curious to see how it goes since this is a league where matches are scheduled ahead of time, and hopefully this will be a bit more accommodating to my schedule. In addition, I&#8217;m looking forward to familiarizing myself with Canadian overtime rules. I&#8217;ve only played it once or twice in the past and have yet to feel comfortable playing with it. Nonetheless, I&#8217;m looking forward to it! And inn case you are wondering, yes I plan on posting every game with my thoughts and comments after each match. =D<br />
Many thanks to Eric (@Oolong4Go) for sharing this with me and getting me to join!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 style="text-align: center;">Friday Go Forward: Week 29</h2>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>So I&#8217;m going to change up the format of my progress report in hopes of determining my own training menu and give you better insight into what I&#8217;m doing each week. Instead of an &#8220;Education and Training&#8221; section, I&#8217;ve split it up into &#8220;Training&#8221; and &#8220;Reading Material&#8221; so there is a clear distinction of what I&#8217;m actively doing. My training regimen is far from what I would like it to be at the moment, but my goal this week has been to establish consistent and disciplined habits in order to make continuous gains. I&#8217;m sure I will still find wrinkles in my system as I progress, but the key thing I&#8217;ll have to remember is to always &#8220;fail forward!&#8221;</p>
<h2>Games</h2>
