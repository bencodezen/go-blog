				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So today was pretty eventful. I am actually flooded in terms of material I want to write about, but my brain is nearly decomposed due to a lack of sleep and an overload of Go. So this post will be short and sweet.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">#1. Hail to fellow Go player chrollo and his new <a href="http://tripleko.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">blog</a> &#8211; <a href="http://tripleko.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">TripleKo</a>! Go check it out. Love the name!</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">#2. Since it&#8217;ll be awhile till I am able to properly update the resources for Go players, Go players need to totally check out GoChild. I think it&#8217;s significantly better than Goproblems.com but more on that later.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">#3. I have been very fortunate to have had my games being reviewed over the past few days. It&#8217;s been a ton of information, but I will do all I can to absorb it and eventually distill it to my readers.</p>

Meanwhile, here is a game I think that a lot of you will enjoy. This was from the ASR League so it was a free game, even, 6.5 pts komi. The matchup is me (11k) vs. my buddy chrollo (2d). I was black. To preface the game, chrollo played extremely aggressively. This was one hell of a game chrollo. Thanks again for an awesome game.<br />
