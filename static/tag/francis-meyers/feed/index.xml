<p>When I woke up, I realized that today was the last day of Congress. Man, where had all the time gone? It seemed like just yesterday I boarded the train with my brother to embark on an epic journey to New York.<br />
The morning consisted of grabbing breakfast and checking out this cool place called <a title="The High Line" href="http://www.thehighline.org/">The High Line</a> that Anders recommended the night before. Luckily for us, it was still beautiful weather so we had a great time exploring the sights.<br />
<a href="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/10/2014GC-D07-02.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5829" src="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/10/2014GC-D07-02.jpg?resize=600%2C800" alt="2014GC-D07-02" width="600" height="800" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><br />
Around lunch, I got a call from Myung letting me know that Jung, Evan, Mark, and him wanted to try a steakhouse in NY before they left. So after meeting up with them at the hotel, we went off to look for one. We found one not too far: <a title="Wolfgang's Steakhouse Yelp" href="http://www.yelp.com/menu/wolfgangs-steakhouse-manhattan-3">Wolfgang Steakhouse</a>.<br />
<span id="more-5816"></span><br />
One of the items that caught my eye on the menu was a $200 steak (to be shared by 4 people). We had five people though, so I didn’t suggest it. Instead everyone went with their Wolfgang’s Steakhouse from their lunch menu.<br />
<figure id="attachment_5819" style="width: 800px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/10/2014GC-D07-04.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-5819" src="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/10/2014GC-D07-04.jpg?resize=720%2C540" alt="Look at the size of that thing!" width="720" height="540" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Look at the size of that thing! And they really got the medium rare down perfectly!</figcaption></figure>
To be honest, I was expecting to get a small piece of steak for the $30 we were paying, but it was HUGE! And though you don&#8217;t see any sides in this picture, there was large sides of mashed potatoes and spinach for everyone to share. To say the least, everyone was very satisfied with lunch. Haha.<br />
After being stuffed with a delicious lunch, Myung had to go attend to some matters; so I was left in charge of helping to guide the rest of the group around New York. So for the rest of the afternoon, we explored Time Square and had a lot of fun seeing all the fun things going on in the city.<br />
Soon it was time for us to return for the awards banquet though. And when we arrived, everyone went to their respective rooms to get ready (except for me). As I looked around for everyone, I noticed that Satoru wasn’t present. Unfortunately, I found out that he had already left and thus we would be unable to say goodbye in person. Nonetheless, it was great seeing him and I certainly hope to see him again in the near future!<br />
Finally it was time for us to enter the banquet hall.<br />
<a href="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/10/2014GC-D07-06.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5820" src="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/10/2014GC-D07-06.jpg?resize=600%2C800" alt="2014GC-D07-06" width="600" height="800" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><br />
<a href="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/10/2014GC-D07-08.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5822" src="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/10/2014GC-D07-08.jpg?resize=600%2C800" alt="2014GC-D07-08" width="600" height="800" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><br />
<img class="aligncenter wp-image-5821 size-full" src="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/10/2014GC-D07-07.jpg?resize=720%2C540" alt="2014GC-D07-07" width="720" height="540" data-recalc-dims="1" /><br />
The menu consisted of pasta with cheese and tomato sauce, chicken fingers, cookies, brownies, bread and drinks. Considering the places I had been eating the entire week, I have to admit I was a little disappointed. However, I just want to stress that I understand that we were primarily paying for the space and not for a top notch meal. So while I was a little disappointed, it was just a personal feeling at the time and not some reflection on the event itself.<br />
<a href="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/10/2014GC-D07-09.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5823" src="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/10/2014GC-D07-09.jpg?resize=720%2C540" alt="2014GC-D07-09" width="720" height="540" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><br />
The awards ceremony was fun though. For a summary of friends who placed:</p>
<ul>
<li>Diego and Terri both placed second in their respective divisions!</li>
<li>Mark Lee went undefeated and won 1st place!</li>
</ul>
<p>A huge congratulations to them on an awesome performance!<br />
Once all the awards had been announced, I realized that this would probably be the last time I would have a chance to talk to the professionals and went to say my final goodbyes and get some pictures taken with them.<br />

With our stomachs full of delicious bagel, we headed down to Brooklyn so that she could try Grimaldi’s.<br />

After walking around a bit, it was time to get in line and eat our delicious pizza!<br />

And with the weather so beautiful, we felt it would be a travesty to take the metro back, so we walked across the Brooklyn Bridge!<br />

Before I knew it though, it was time for me to head back for my simul of the day against Francis Meyers, 1p. (At this point, I was trying to play as many different professionals as possible.) The following is the game record:<br />

<p>After my game finished, I went downstairs to help Myung and Dahye take more pictures of them while they were teaching another teacher seminar.<br />

When the class wrapped up, Myung had asked if I was available to eat dinner that night (which naturally I was). However, at the last minute he had to cancel because one of his student’s parents wanted to take him out to dinner. So I left to meet up with my girlfriend and try some great falafels and crepes!<br />

By the time I got back to Hotel Pennsylvania, Myung and Jungsang were giving a game commentary on one of the games played by Andy Liu 1p.<br />

After taking a few pictures for them, I went to see where everyone was since I didn&#8217;t see anyone in the audience. And guess where I found my friends Nate and Diego?<br />

After watching the games for a bit, I walked out of the Master’s Tournament room, I turned to my right and who do I end up seeing?!<br />

It was great to finally be able to meet Anders in person. I’m just sad I wasn’t able to hangout with him more! Oh well, at least I got the chance to meet the legendary Anders in person!</p>
