				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Lately I have been on a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fighting_Spirit_(manga)">Hajime no Ippo</a> kick and can&#8217;t seem to put it down. With each match that I read, I&#8217;m severely reminded of how much they endure in order to be crowned the victor at the end of each match. Of course, some of their battles are won in a one round KO; but for the most part, the victor rarely comes out unscathed and is often sweating profusely and breathing heavily when holding is victory pose.<br />
Being the go player that I am, I couldn&#8217;t help but draw connections between the two sports (albeit physical vs. mental, but you get my point). Too often, I have found that players are often looking for the easy win. The one-sided match where only a miracle might possibly save the opponent. And I&#8217;ll be honest, I have been and still am (to some degree) guilty of that. After all, it feels good when you&#8217;re knocking your opponent around and in full control of the game.<br />
However, the pursuit of that type of dominating game is unhealthy for a go player. More often than not, the constant attempt at trying to throw that KO punch will be met with a timely counter that reverses the position and knocks you out before you know it. It is a terrible mindset that will only corrode your go as time goes on.<br />
Instead, we must strive to be patient. Use your strengths and strike while maintaining a manageable level of risk. Endure your opponents attacks and the dips that will inevitably come with most games. All you need to remember, as you parry the board against your opponent, is that you don&#8217;t need to win by KO or by 30 points. You only need <strong>half a point</strong> to be the victor.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I recently finished the arc (in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fighting_Spirit_(manga)">Hajime no Ippo</a>) where Ippo and Sendou fighting for the championship, and I couldn&#8217;t help but realize that a game of go is very much like a match in boxing. With each stone, each player prepares the battlefield. Before you know it, a furious chase and battle occurs where the one is rushing forward in a series of attacks while the other is stepping backwards and trying to gain solid footing. When the barrage is over however, the tide changes as the opponent regains his foothold and then returns a series of attack back as you try to ensure the safety of your attacking group.<br />
In the end, a player&#8217;s ability to win a game from start to finish lies in his/her ability to withstand the exchange of blows that is sure to come in every game. Of course, there are times when the game simply boils down to a huge hitting match where the game can only in KO. So unless it is between two opponents of different caliber, no player can expect to get out of a game unscathed and unchallenged.<br />
After finishing the arc, I realized that I had forgotten the endurance and tenacity a player must bring to every game. There is no room for pity or doubt. There is only room for those who&#8217;s fighting spirits echo even after the last stone has been placed on the board.</p>

<h2>Thoughts</h2>
<p>Although I haven&#8217;t played as much as I might have liked, this week has been pretty interesting in terms of the various activities I&#8217;ve had going on. My go studying has taken on more flavors and variety, which has greatly increased my enjoyment of what I&#8217;m learning. In addition, it feels as if I&#8217;m starting to think less and less of winning, which is something I hope to ingrain permanently into my being. There are a number of reasons due to this spark of an epiphany. One that I will mention in particular is from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fighting_Spirit_(manga)">Hajime no Ippo</a>.<br />
The line comes from a scene after the main character, Ippo, manages to win against a boxer who&#8217;s goal was to become like his idol. When analyzing what happened and why Ippo won (even though he was an underdog), the idol said:</p>
<blockquote><p>It was the result of different goals between the challengers. Those who try to reach and those who try to surpass.</p></blockquote>
<p>Although I&#8217;ve heard similar lines to this before, it was rather profound to me when I read it (perhaps due to the emotional attachment to characters and the story). And to be honest, I think there&#8217;s a lot of truth in there. Because in actuality, my goal is not to simply reach shodan; but to surpass it entirely.</p>
