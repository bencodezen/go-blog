[expand title=&#8221;Before I Read This Book&#8230;&#8221; trigclass=&#8221;expandTitle&#8221;]
As a mid to high SDK (i.e., single digit kyu) player, I was expecting to see the same quality of content from previous volumes. In addition, I was hoping that I would be able to solve most problems with relative ease while finding some problems challenging.<br />
[/expand]
[expand title=&#8221;My Review&#8221; trigclass=&#8221;expandTitle&#8221; expanded=&#8221;true&#8221;]
This volume starts with a skill that I believe many players are lazy about: counting liberties. And to be honest, I did not realize how much I would have to struggle through this section. It wasn&#8217;t until I started working through these problems that I realized how lazy I&#8217;ve been and how weak I am at this fundamental skill. Though a bit of a shock, it was a good reminder of how weak my basics are.<br />
In this volume, a new problem type is introduced: profiting from your opponent&#8217;s overplays. This was by far one of the most surprising and enjoyable sections in the book since very little practice is ever given to players for this. Stronger players constantly tell weaker players to learn how to punish overplays, but there has been little material to focus on how to do so. Up till this book, I always found that learning to punish overplays came from experience and nothing else. Well, this section is that something else.<br />
Another thing that I noticed in this book is the categorization of life and death problems based on techniques. Most of the life and death books I have encountered thus far generally just include an assortment of problems, but I think that the categorization of problems based on technique is one of the more effective ways to teach players from the ground up. I definitely am hoping to see more of this in the future.<br />
And as if I wasn&#8217;t already impressed enough with this volume, they also take great care to teach the foundation behind the usage of certain moves or techniques. For example, many of us are familiar with what snapback is, but we don&#8217;t really get much training in regards to making the snapback. Another example would be practicing the double hane. Most players learn that it&#8217;s a useful move, but players are often forced to guess and learn the hard way in the middle of their game. And that can be painfully slow if you are only playing occassionally and do not have guidance at all.<br />
Finally, though it feels a little late in the series to finally see this, I&#8217;m really glad that they have a section devoted to training basic sente and gote understanding. Players can practice what I consider the most fundamental endgame problem: Find the sente endgame move. You might scoff at how simple that sounds, but I cannot count how many times I&#8217;ve seen kyu players just blatantly ignore sente plays for gote ones.<br />
Bottom line: Though I didn&#8217;t think they could improve the series much more, this volume just goes to show how well Lee Jae-Hwan understands breaking down the fundamentals of go into understable bite size pieces. Highly recommended!<br />
[/expand]
[expand title=&#8221;Synopsis&#8221; trigclass=&#8221;expandTitle&#8221;]
<strong>What did I enjoy about the book?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Forces players to understand counting liberties in capturing races.</li>
<li>Focuses on how to punish overplays that players commonly make.</li>
<li>Trains players on how to properly utilize moves like double hane.</li>
<li>Introduces sente and gote in an easy to understand manner.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What did I gain from reading this book?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Realization of how weak my liberty counting abilities are. They are stronger now, but I know that I still have a bit to go before I am confident in them.</li>
<li>Better understanding of how to use the double hane.</li>
<li>Sharpened intuition for utilizing tesuji like snapback and shortage of liberties.</li>
<li>Reinforced understanding of the foundation of endgame plays.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What is the format of the book?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The book is primarily structured as follows:
<ul>
<li>(1) A one page explanation of the topic that you are about to practice. Example: When behind in liberties. They not only show the sequence for the proper technique, but also include common mistakes and brief explanations as to why they are mistakes.</li>
<li>(2) A set of very easy to understand and follow practice problems to ensure you understand what you are learning.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What aspect can be improved on?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Page 145 &#8211; Directions should read: Black to play a sente move.</li>
<li>Page 162: Problem #20 &#8211; The solution in the answer book is technically correct in that it&#8217;s the best endgame sequence. However, it fails to what the problem is asking for (i.e., A, B, or C) since it chooses D (which does not exist in the book). For those who are looking for the simple answer, it is A.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Is this book easy to read?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Yes. It doesn&#8217;t get much more simple or straightforward than this.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Bottom Line</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Continues to live up to the quality of content you come to expect from this series.</li>
<li>Provides excellent practice for concepts many players overlook (e.g., counting liberties).</li>
<li>Completely worth your time and money!</li>
</ol>
[/expand]
[expand title=&#8221;Recommended For&#8230;&#8221; trigclass=&#8221;expandTitle&#8221;]
<ul>
<li>Though the series is designed for kids, both kids and adults alike will be able to learn everything they need to know about playing go in a fun and entertaining way.</li>
<li>People who enjoy learning things in an easy to understand format and lots of opportunities to reinforce what they are learning.</li>

They do a fantastic job taking joseki and breaking it down into its most elementary form in the effort to get players to learn the joseki instead of simply memorizing them.<br />

<strong>My Abilities</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>I have been exposed to a fair number of joseki by this point, but I was far from being able to understand why they were played the way they were. In addition, figuring out how to punish josekis was a whole level above my head as well.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>My Perspective</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>While I might have become familiar with a few joseki here and there, I was realy hoping to start from the ground up and get a much better how joseki are created and built.</li>
</ul>
[/expand]
[expand title=&#8221;Synopsis&#8221;  trigclass=&#8221;expandTitle&#8221;]
<strong>What did I enjoy about the book?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The way they teach joseki is SO easy to understand!</li>
<li>They take their time explaining why certain moves are mistakes.</li>
<li>There are many opportunities for reinforcement on picking the right move.</li>
<li>They have you evaluate the first 30-40 moves of a game and have you figure out which move was a mistake.</li>
<li>They teach joseki that takes into consider other stone positions such as a star side point that is occupied.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What did I gain from reading this book?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A much better understanding of why joseki sequences are what they are.</li>
<li>A significant boost in my comfort with joseki as a whole.</li>
<li>Higher confidence in my ability to &#8220;create joseki&#8221; rather than &#8220;memorize joseki.&#8221;</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What is the format of the book?</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>A brief introduction on why one should study joseki along with some advice for how to study joseki.</li>
<li>A brief review on the proper way to extend.</li>
<li>All chapters on joseki then following the format below:
<ol>
<li>Basic overview of the sequence for the joseki with accompanying one line explanations for each move.</li>
<li>A page or two on how to deal with mistakes and why the mistakes are good or bad for the respective player.</li>
<li>Practice problems for how to respond to different situations. This includes mistakes along with proper moves.</li>
<li>One to two problems where you have to evaluation a kifu (approximately 10-30 moves long) and determine which player played better and which move was the mistake.</li>
<li>One to two sample professional openings that usually contain the joseki that the reader just learned.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>What aspect can be improved on?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>There are some useful proverbs that are placed on the bottom of the page (e.g., &#8220;Even a moron connects against a peep.&#8221;), but they can be rather cryptic at times. This is possibly due to the fact they were translated from Korean, but they&#8217;re not as helpful as I was hoping. Although to be clear, this is not the focus of the book, so it&#8217;s not a big deal.</li>
<li>They need to make more of these books! More more more!</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Is this book easy to read?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Yes. It doesn&#8217;t get much simpler than this.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Bottom Line</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>This is how joseki should have been taught from day one!</li>
<li>An incredible way to be introduced to joseki as a whole.</li>
<li>Serves as a fantastic companion to the rest of the Level Up Series.</li>
</ol>
[/expand]
[expand title=&#8221;My Review&#8221; trigclass=&#8221;expandTitle&#8221; expanded=&#8221;true&#8221;]
One of the reasons I have always avoided the study of joseki is that most of the literature out there is EXTREMELY dense when you consider that a large portion of players interested in joseki are kyu players. In addition, I personally feel that kyu players encounter far more star point joseki in their games due to the nature of being a kyu player. In addition, star point joseki have far fewer variations and much easier to undrestand.<br />
This is seriously an incredible milestone for go literature. In all honesty, this is the book that everyone should use when they want to start learning about joseki. And in fact, this is the way that all joseki should be taught from the get go. There are so many opportunities for reinforcement. For example, I am completely in love with the new problem format they introduce: analyzing a kifu and determining not only who played better, but which move was the mistake as well! INCREDIBLE!<br />
[/expand]
[expand title=&#8221;Recommended For&#8230;&#8221; trigclass=&#8221;expandTitle&#8221;]
<ul>
<li>Players who want an easy to understand introduction to creating joseki (as opposed to memorizing them).</li>
<li>Players who want opportunities to practice the sequence through problems instead of waiting till the off-chance it occurs in their games.</li>
