				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>This week has been very sparse in terms of study and playing, but extremely heavy in regards to writing (if you didn’t notice with the Weekly Go Wednesday article). And though my time has been a bit more biased towards writing, I don’t think any of you are complaining. Haha.<br />
It’s taken some time to break into my productivity system, but the cogs and wheels are starting to mesh together better now. I’m much more aware of where my time is going along with how I’m progressing as a whole in life now. Whole board thinking. See that?<br />
I’m looking forward to when my entire system works effortlessly and I can really amp up my go training. No matter though. Slow and steady wins the race.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 style="text-align: left;">Overview</h2>
<p>Once again I&#8217;ve decided to trim down on my training regimen in order to up the quality of training. This means more time spent on each topic as well as increasing repetition in order to further solidify what I&#8217;m learning. In other words, I&#8217;m no longer simply looking to find out what the correct answer is; but to instead really try to immerse myself in it so the reading ability becomes more ingrained in me.<br />
In terms of gameplay, it has been a rather abysmal week. I got into a weird mood and ended up losing 5 games in a row. It was pretty awful considering my go deteriorated to the point where my final game was a resignation against a 4k. Playing on tilt is just not a pretty sight for me at all. Haha. But on the upside, I did manage to recollect myself enough to manage a win for my <a title="Yunguseng Dojang Official Site" href="http://www.yunguseng.com/">Yunguseng Dojang</a> match. So hooray for that!<br />
And as <a title="Taking a Second Look at the Blog" href="//taking-second-look-blog/">mentioned earlier this week</a>, there are some changes coming up on the blog that should hopefully improve the reading experience and value that this blog has. So I&#8217;ve been working on that as well and trying to iron out some of the changes I&#8217;m trying to make. Fingers crossed it goes smoothly!</p>
<h2>Training Regimen</h2>
<ul>
<li>Play 3 games a week.</li>
<li>Complete 1 section of <a title="Book Review: Jump Level Up 1" href="//book-review-jump-level-1/">Jump Level Up 1</a> per day.</li>
<li>Work on <em>Get Strong at Life and Death</em>.</li>
<li>Work on <a title="Book Review: Get Strong at Tesuji" href="//book-review-get-strong-tesuji/">Get Strong at Tesuji</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Games</h2>
<ul>
<li><a title="IGS PandaNet Official Site" href="http://www.pandanet-igs.com/">Pandanet-IGS</a> &#8211; 1 game</li>
<li><a title="KGS Website" href="http://www.gokgs.com/">KGS</a> &#8211;  9 games</li>
<li><a title="Dragon Go Server - BenGoZen's Profile" href="http://www.dragongoserver.net/userinfo.php?uid=60385">DGS</a> &#8211; 6 ongoing games</li>
<li><a title="Online Go Server - BenGoZen's Profile" href="http://online-go.com/user/view/549/BenGoZen">OGS</a> &#8211;  6 ongoing games</li>
</ul>
<h2>Books</h2>
<ul>
<li><a title="Book Review: Jump Level Up 1" href="//book-review-jump-level-1/">Jump Level Up 1</a> by Baduktopia</li>
<li><em>Get Strong at Life and Death</em> by Richard Bozulich</li>
<li><a title="Book Review: Get Strong at Tesuji" href="//book-review-get-strong-tesuji/">Get Strong at Tesuji</a> by Richard Bozulich</li>
</ul>
<h2>Lessons Learned</h2>
<ul>
<li>Playing on tilt has consequences&#8230; like dropping two stones in rank on KGS. Hahaha.</li>
<li>Take all your opponents seriously regardless of their rank. I&#8217;ve posted about this multiple times, but it&#8217;s come to bite me in the butt again.</li>
<li>There is a huge difference between winning a game and crushing your opponent. Taking one attitude versus another has a profound impact on your approach to the game mentally, but more on this later.</li>
<li>This might sound utterly basic, but I seriously need to use my brain more when I play. I miss the most common variations in my blitz reading. I read one variation and think it&#8217;s good and fail to consider other obvious alternatives. Oy vey.</li>
</ul>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 style="text-align: left;">Overview</h2>
<p>The theme of this week has been: <strong>Ben needs to improve his reading abilities</strong>. Haha. Many thanks to all those who commented on my <a title="Returning to the Fundamentals" href="//returning-fundamentals/">WGW post</a> and helped me refocus my time and energy on the correct area of weakness. I even had the pleasure of hanging out with local go player Justin (AGA 7d) who helped to straighten me out a bit. It was a fun time of playing and going over some variations on joseki that I should be familiar with. It certainly showed me that there is still much more I can do to improve, which is always motivating.<br />
Finally, as I continue trying to improve this blog, I have to keep in mind the time and energy required for each post along with whether or not that material I&#8217;m writing is even relevant anymore. After all, all of this is meant for your reading enjoyment (and a small percentage for chronicling my own journey)! As a result, over the next few weeks, I&#8217;ll be asking for feedback on what you see on this blog to help optimize everything.<br />
To start, I wanted to do a quick poll on your thoughts on this weekly series: Friday Go Forward. So if you don&#8217;t mind, please leave a comment below to let me know if you think this series is worth keeping around and/or anything I could do to improve it (i.e., specific things you&#8217;d like to see me talk about in my Overview section since I&#8217;m sometimes unsure of what to write in here)<strong>.</strong> And if you think it&#8217;s good the way it is, it would be good to hear that as well. Thanks!</p>

<li>I really need to work on my reading abilities if I want to take my game to the next level.</li>

<h2 style="text-align: left;">Overview</h2>
<p>During the past few weeks, I ended up skewing my training to playing games and sacrificing study in order to re-acclimate myself to playing games again. As a result, my weaknesses became very clear as I would lose game after game after game.<br />
After <a title="Discovering My “Master Wu”" href="//discovering-master-wu/">discovering my Master Wu</a>, my training has once again gone under another stage of growth as I really begin to immerse myself in practicing &#8220;deep learning&#8221; as is discussed in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Talent-Code-Greatness-Grown/dp/055380684X">The Talent Code</a>.  And though it&#8217;s too early to tell if it&#8217;s working, I feel like the wheels of progress are beginning to turn. Fingers crossed that I&#8217;m not wrong. Haha.</p>
<h2>Training Regimen</h2>
<ul>
<li>Play 3 games a week.</li>
<li>Complete 1 section of Level Up Review 2 per day.</li>
<li>Study 10 life and death patterns/problems.</li>

<h2>Lessons Learned</h2>
<ul>
<li>Though difficult to grasp, learning how to make proper trades throughout your game is one of the key milestones to being a strong player. This is particularly evident in the way Go Seigen plays (and yes admittedly difficult to do).</li>
<li>As I replay more and more of Go Seigen&#8217;s kifu, I&#8217;ve realized how constricted my go has become. It is missing the freedom that is so glaringly exists in Go Seigen&#8217;s games.</li>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 style="text-align: left;">Overview</h2>
<p>This week has been a great continuation of my new philosophy of gaining <a title="Experience on the Battlefield" href="//experience-on-the-battlefield/">experience on the battlefield</a>. I&#8217;ve always felt that experience on the battlefield was necessary, but it wasn&#8217;t until I really started taking it seriously that I&#8217;ve come to understand the depth of that fundamental truth. In fact, as a result of me playing more games (and of course losing more often), I was actually able to win my third round of <a title="Yunguseng Dojang Official Site" href="http://www.yunguseng.com/">Yunguseng Dojang</a>! So within a week, I already have some proof of the method working!<br />
As you will notice, my training regimen has been trimmed a bit. Unlike the past however, the reason I&#8217;ve decided to trim it down is not because it&#8217;s burning me out or anything of the sort, but instead it&#8217;s a matter of having some other activities I need to prioritize at the moment. And to be clear, what I write in the &#8220;Training Regimen&#8221; section is what I am requiring myself to work on everyday. When I have some extra time, then I will be doing other things as well.<br />
Hope that all is well with everyone and that you all have a great Memorial Day weekend!</p>
<h2>Training Regimen</h2>
<ul>
<li>Spend about 50% of your time playing games.</li>
<li>Complete 1 section of Level Up Review 2.</li>

<h2>Lessons Learned</h2>
<ul>
<li>Just because you have a three in a row shape inside your opponent’s group doesn’t mean it’s dead. Seki is possible too. (-_-)</li>
<li>When you are about to start a fight, make sure that you are not at a disadvantage.</li>
<li>A ponnuki with an empty triangle is not as efficient early on as you might think.</li>
<li>Do not underestimate the power of a good extension from your thickness.</li>
