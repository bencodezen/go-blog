[expand title=&#8221;Before I Read This Book&#8230;&#8221; trigclass=&#8221;expandTitle&#8221;]
When I first started learning about modern day go professionals, it&#8217;s to no one&#8217;s surprise that one of the first names I came upon was Lee Changho. Not only was he extremely famous, but it seemed he was undisputedly #1 at the time (although he might have started dropping ranks by the time I learned about him). So it goes without saying that I was curious what made him so strong, and thus it led me to purchasing this book.<br />
[/expand]
[expand title=&#8221;My Review&#8221; trigclass=&#8221;expandTitle&#8221; expanded=&#8221;true&#8221;]
Similar to Master Style of Play: Go Seigen, you are initially greeted with a fun little dialogue between Yuan Zhou and two amateur players to give an introduction on Lee Changho and his background. After a couple of pages of this, Zhou then dives right into the game reviews.<br />
One of the things that I enjoyed about the game diagrams in this book is that they are often only a couple moves long. This makes it a lot easier to follow what is going on and allows weaker players to have a chance to understand what is going on. In addition, the variations are kept to a minimum in order to keep a focus on Lee Changho&#8217;s style instead of go theory and technique.<br />
Upon finishing both game commentaries, I am glad that I finally took the time to gain insight into Lee Changho&#8217;s style. It&#8217;s quite simple and straightforward when compared to Go Seigen, but it is one of the more appropriate styles that I feel kyu players should check out first. This is because Lee Changho&#8217;s games convey the prime example of how one does not have to risk battles of epic proportions to win games, which is something I think many kyu players never take the time to learn or realize.<br />
At the end of the day, this is a book that is best suited for those looking to get a glimpse into Lee Changho&#8217;s style and what it means to play calm go. Definitely recommended for kyu players.<br />

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Every other blue moon, we have the opportunity to stumble onto something pretty awesome. Fellow go player Bonscott shared an incredible resource that I think you would all find just as fascinating as I did the first time I tried it:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://gostyle.j2m.cz/webapp.html">GoStyle WebApp</a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The process is really simple. Just visit the link above and enter in your KGS username (or send a zip file of a bunch of games), and click Submit. It will take a few minutes or so to process all your games, but the resulting report is just incredible.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Besides the fact that it&#8217;s free and you have nothing to lose by trying it, here are things you can expect in the report:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Estimated Strength</strong> &#8211; Believe it or not. This is not just based on the ranks of players you play with. Mine seems a little inflated (~1k), but it&#8217;s cool that they try to estimate your strength aside from your determined rank on KGS and the players you play.</li>
<li><strong>Style</strong> &#8211; On a scale of 1 &#8211; 10, it tells you where you fall in terms of: Territorality, Novelty, Agressivity, Thickness</li>
<li><strong>Professionals who have a similar style to you</strong> &#8211; *mind blown*</li>
<li><strong>Professionals whose style is farthest from yours</strong> &#8211; *mind blown*</li>
<li><strong>Distinctive patterns and tips</strong> &#8211; It analyzes the patterns in your games and tells you bad habits and even gives you inspiration for new moves to try!</li>
</ol>
<p>Granted, this is still a work in progress and not perfect by any means; but I think it&#8217;s a really cool tool for go players.<br />
If you&#8217;re interested in what the WebApp said about me, be sure to see below:<br />
