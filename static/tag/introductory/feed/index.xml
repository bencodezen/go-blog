<p><strong>Description:</strong> This is the first of many (at least I hope) joseki books from the incredible authors who created the Level Up Series. They do a fantastic job taking joseki and breaking it down into its most elementary form in the effort to get players to learn the joseki instead of simply memorizing them.<br />

<strong>My Abilities</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>I have been exposed to a fair number of joseki by this point, but I was far from being able to understand why they were played the way they were. In addition, figuring out how to punish josekis was a whole level above my head as well.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>My Perspective</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>While I might have become familiar with a few joseki here and there, I was realy hoping to start from the ground up and get a much better how joseki are created and built.</li>
</ul>
[/expand]
[expand title=&#8221;Synopsis&#8221; Â trigclass=&#8221;expandTitle&#8221;]
<strong>What did I enjoy about the book?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The way they teach joseki is SO easy to understand!</li>
<li>They take their time explaining why certain moves are mistakes.</li>
<li>There are many opportunities for reinforcement on picking the right move.</li>
<li>They have you evaluate the first 30-40 moves of a game and have you figure out which move was a mistake.</li>
<li>They teach joseki that takes into consider other stone positions such as a star side point that is occupied.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What did I gain from reading this book?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A much better understanding of why joseki sequences are what they are.</li>
<li>A significant boost in my comfort with joseki as a whole.</li>
<li>Higher confidence in my ability to &#8220;create joseki&#8221; rather than &#8220;memorize joseki.&#8221;</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What is the format of the book?</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>A brief introduction on why one should study joseki along with some advice for how to study joseki.</li>
<li>A brief review on the proper way to extend.</li>
<li>All chapters on joseki then following the format below:
<ol>
<li>Basic overview of the sequence for the joseki with accompanying one line explanations for each move.</li>
<li>A page or two on how to deal with mistakes and why the mistakes are good or bad for the respective player.</li>
<li>Practice problems for how to respond to different situations. This includes mistakes along with proper moves.</li>
<li>One to two problems where you have to evaluation a kifu (approximately 10-30 moves long) and determine which player played better and which move was the mistake.</li>
<li>One to two sample professional openings that usually contain the joseki that the reader just learned.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>What aspect can be improved on?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>There are some useful proverbs that are placed on the bottom of the page (e.g., &#8220;Even a moron connects against a peep.&#8221;), but they can be rather cryptic at times. This is possibly due to the fact they were translated from Korean, but they&#8217;re not as helpful as I was hoping. Although to be clear, this is not the focus of the book, so it&#8217;s not a big deal.</li>
<li>They need to make more of these books! More more more!</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Is this book easy to read?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Yes. It doesn&#8217;t get much simpler than this.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Bottom Line</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>This is how joseki should have been taught from day one!</li>
<li>An incredible way to be introduced to joseki as a whole.</li>
<li>Serves as a fantastic companion to the rest of the Level Up Series.</li>
</ol>
[/expand]
[expand title=&#8221;My Review&#8221; trigclass=&#8221;expandTitle&#8221; expanded=&#8221;true&#8221;]
One of the reasons I have always avoided the study of joseki is that most of the literature out there is EXTREMELY dense when you consider that a large portion of players interested in joseki are kyu players. In addition, I personally feel that kyu players encounter far more star point joseki in their games due to the nature of being a kyu player. In addition, star point joseki have far fewer variations and much easier to undrestand.<br />
This is seriously an incredible milestone for go literature. In all honesty, this is the book that everyone should use when they want to start learning about joseki. And in fact, this is the way that all joseki should be taught from the get go. There are so many opportunities for reinforcement. For example, I am completely in love with the new problem format they introduce: analyzing a kifu and determining not only who played better, but which move was the mistake as well! INCREDIBLE!<br />
[/expand]
[expand title=&#8221;Recommended For&#8230;&#8221; trigclass=&#8221;expandTitle&#8221;]
<ul>
<li>Players who want an easy to understand introduction to creating joseki (as opposed to memorizing them).</li>
<li>Players who want opportunities to practice the sequence through problems instead of waiting till the off-chance it occurs in their games.</li>
</ul>

<strong>My Abilities</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>While I have done some studying on handicap go, my knowledge is primarily a compilation of advice from other people along with my own experience as well. Overall, I would say that I believe I have a basic understanding of how handicap games should be played.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>My Perspective</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Though I&#8217;ve read tidbits on handicap go here and there, I am hoping that this book will be the first that tries to break down handicap go into into simplest components in order to provide guidance to players new to handicap go.</li>
</ul>
[/expand]
[expand title=&#8221;My Review&#8221; trigclass=&#8221;expandTitle&#8221; expanded=&#8221;true&#8221;]
<strong>What did I enjoy about the book?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The advice for Black is broken down into 20 strategic principles.</li>
<li>There is a chapter devoted to advising how one should play with White.</li>
<li>There are example games that range from professionals level to amateur dan level.</li>
<li>There are practice problems to help reinforce the concepts the reader just learned.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What did I gain from reading this book?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A better understanding of how to play as Black in handicap games.</li>
<li>Realization that as White it is not actually beneficial to make overplays consistently, but rather to play solid moves with strategic value and to take advantage of Black&#8217;s inefficient moves and/or strategic plans.</li>
<li>A new perspective on how handicap games actually should go all the way into the endgame for the handicap to be considered fair in relation to the ranks.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What style of teaching does the book use?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Textbook Approach
<ul>
<li>Explanations can be very dense at times and it uses problems or examples to try and illustrate its message. This is not a negative thing though, since it allows for re-readability in the future.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Primary Learning Mechanism:
<ul>
<li>Explanations.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Other Learning Mechanisms:
<ul>
<li>Practice problems.</li>
<li>Examples from professional and amateur level games.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What aspect can be improved on?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>In the future, I think it would be nice to see strategic principles organized for White the way it is designed for Black. Not sure how possible this really is, but it&#8217;d be neat if it were possible.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Is this book easy to read?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Yes. Though some explanations may be advanced at times, Bozulich strikes a great balance between introductory explanations and advanced concepts. It makes for a solid book that will be worth re-reading in the future.</li>
</ul>

<strong>My Abilities</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A mid to high SDK (single digit kyu) kyu who has read his fair share of go books and has a pretty strong foundation in the basics and teaching go.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>My Perspective</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>After Level Up 3, I was expecting things to start to start getting more difficult; but hopefully still manageable.</li>
</ul>
[/expand]
[expand title=&#8221;My Review&#8221; trigclass=&#8221;expandTitle&#8221; expanded=&#8221;true&#8221;]
<strong>What did I enjoy about the book?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>I enjoyed that they use &#8220;next move&#8221; questions that provide a mini-simulation of what kind of decisions you might make in a game.</li>
<li>When drilling life and death shapes, they spare no effort in making sure you not only know where the vital point of the shape is, but how to create the shape when killing your opponent or avoiding offering the opponent a chance to create the shape.</li>
<li>Does a great job introducing dame (aka neutral) points and giving the reader opportunities to practice finding them along with how to be careful about how accidentally filling the wrong dame points can actually cause problems.</li>
<li>Introduces &#8220;endgame&#8221; at its most basic level: closing off or reducing territory.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What did I gain from reading this book?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Continued polishing my reading abilities &#8211; particularly shortage of liberties and nets.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What style of teaching does the book use?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Curriculum Style
<ul>
<li>Content is organized into lessons, topics, or themes in order to facilitate learning.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Primary Learning Mechanism:
<ul>
<li>Practice problems.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Other Learning Mechanisms:
<ul>
<li>Simple explanations accompanied by equally simple diagrams.</li>
<li>Fun comics to help explain concepts like the net.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What aspect can be improved on?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Up to this point, the answer books have been great on its own. For this book however, I noticed that there were times where answers to questions that asked the reader &#8220;Which direction to block?&#8221; would be best served if there were a short explanation as to why. Granted, this may be omitted due to it being used in a school setting where a go teacher would explain it; but if the answer books are intended to be sufficient without a teacher, then this would be very helpful.</li>

[expand title=&#8221;Synopsis&#8221; trigclass=&#8221;expandTitle&#8221;Â expanded=&#8221;true&#8221;]
<ol>
<li>The best introductory book that I have encountered thus far.</li>
<li>Imagine one of those practice workbooks you used to have in school, except about go.</li>
<li>Does a fantastic job giving the reader lots of opportunity to reinforce the concepts they learn.</li>
</ol>
[/expand]
[expand title=&#8221;Before I Read This Book&#8230;&#8221; trigclass=&#8221;expandTitle&#8221;]
<strong>My Abilities</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A 5 kyu who has read his fair share of go books and has a pretty strong foundation in the basics and teaching go.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>My Perspective</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>I was looking for a series that could fill the missing niche of breaking down concepts in an easy to understand manner while giving lots of opportunity to practice what they just learned.</li>
</ul>
[/expand]
[expand title=&#8221;My Review&#8221; trigclass=&#8221;expandTitle&#8221;Â expanded=&#8221;true&#8221;]
<strong>What did I enjoy about the book?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The diagrams and explanations are very simple and very easy to follow, which is ideal for new players.</li>
<li>There are lots of opportunity to reinforce the concept being taught regardless of how &#8220;easy&#8221; it is.</li>
<li>It is very evident that a lot of effort went into structuring the content like a curriculum so that it builds upon previous concepts as the reader progresses.</li>
<li>They do a great job with acclimating the reader to more complicated diagrams. For example, the first capture scenarios literally only involve one group. Next round, they add some miscellaneous stones to the diagram while still marking the important stones to start acclimating the reader to seeing more complicated diagrams. Love it.</li>
<li>Though the book is designed for kids, both kids and adults alike will be able to learn everything they need to know about playing go in a fun and entertaining way.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What did I gain from reading this book?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Even though I already know all of these concepts, forcing myself to go through the book from start to finish was a great way for me to ensure that my reading abilities were 100% with even the most basic problems.</li>
<li>The school and workbook-like approach to teaching go has definitely helped me improve the way that I will be teaching go in the future.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What style of teaching does the book use?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Workbook Approach
<ul>
<li>They introduce concepts within one to two lines with diagrams to support them.</li>
<li>Once they introduce a concept, they provide multiple opportunities for practice.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Primary Teaching Mechanism:
<ul>
<li>Solving simple and easy problems.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Other Teaching Mechanisms:
<ul>
<li>Explanations with really easy multiple choice questions.</li>
<li>Kifus (i.e., game records) that are only around 10 moves long with short one line statements of the move&#8217;s purpose.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What aspect(s) can be improved on?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Sometimes the directions are misleading. For example, the direction is to atari the marked stones, but the problem&#8217;s solution is actually to capture. Two different objectives.</li>
<li>While most of the book is structured very well, sometimes the problems get ahead of themselves. For example, the directions are toÂ atari the stones, but you need to actually be able to read out the ladder to know which way to atari.</li>
<li>For the next edition, I would recommend that jachung (i.e., reducing your own liberties) be introduced earlier since some problems prior to the explanation actually utilize it.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Is this book easy to read?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>It was very easy to progress through the book.</li>
<li>The English is not always the most grammatically correct, but the message is still pretty clear.</li>
</ul>
