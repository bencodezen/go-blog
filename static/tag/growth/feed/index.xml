				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It occurred to me recently that it seems that all I do is nothing but study, play or write about go. Though I would love that to be the case, I can assure you that it is not the case. I am like any other working soul in society: I have a 9 to 5 job, I live on my own (which means I have to cook, clean, and do all those non-go related chores xD), I have other interests (e.g., web design, coding, tennis, sports, etc.), and I have more familial responsibility than most might care to have. Nonetheless, I have somehow managed to squeeze in go in between all the other things that I care about. Why am I writing about this? Good question.<br />
In most players pursuit to gain another stone, it seems there is an illusion that in order to do so, you must devote all your time and energy the way an insei does. Whether you believe me or not, nothing could be further from the truth.<br />
The reason why I know I can say this with absolute certainty is that most players&#8217; goal is to simply surpass the kyus and successfully live amongst the dan players. In other words, not become a professional. With that in mind, the first step to continuing progress is to realize that progress in go is rarely (if ever) made in leaps and bounds. Similar to building a house, it is important that every level be built with the most solid foundation possible. Otherwise, when the house gets to 4 to 5 stories high, it won&#8217;t take much for the whole thing to come crashing down.<br />
For those who aspire to be professional players, I applaud your tenacity and ambition. In fact, I would have to admit that even I am secretly hoping to rise to the level of a professional. So believe me when I say that the importance of our growth through one solid step at a time is more critical than anyone else. After all, professionals play at a level where the slightest mistake (such as the timing of one forcing move over another) can make the difference between winning and losing.<br />
To those frustrated with their progress, remember that go is a never ending journey where new ideas will constantly be born. The moment we think we know what we&#8217;re doing and have some new &#8220;sure-win&#8221; strategy, someone will come along and blow it away. So just keep at it with an unrelenting discipline to study (even if only for 10 minutes a day) and to focus on playing inspired games where you learn something rather than simply winning. Once you&#8217;ve grasped that, the depth and bottomless pit of wisdom that go has to offer will open its doors to you.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 style="text-align: center"><em>Weekly Go Wednesday, Issue #13</em></h2>
<p><a href="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2013/01/wgw13.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1677" alt="wgw13" src="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2013/01/wgw13.jpg?resize=300%2C342" width="300" height="342" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left">Whenever a player says that they&#8217;ve hit a wall in their growth, the first question I would ask every player is: Are you playing any even games with stronger players? That&#8217;s right. Are you putting yourself in a precarious situation where defeat is practically guaranteed? And before you go rushing off to write your rebuttal in the comments, here me out in the following Q&amp;A:</p>
<p style="text-align: left"><span id="more-1658"></span></p>
<p><em>&#8220;Ben. Are you out of your mind?! What are you trying to do? Ruin any remaining self-esteem I have and enjoyment in playing go?&#8221;</em><br />
No no. I assure you that I only have the best intentions in mind for you when I suggest such a seemingly crazy idea. And the bottom line is, if you are looking for ways to get stronger, I sincerely believe that playing even games against stronger players gives you an opportunity to elevate your game to the next level.<br />
<em>&#8220;But Ben, I am already losing to people around my level. Why would I want to increase my losing streak by playing even games against stronger players?&#8221;</em><br />
Well here&#8217;s the thing, if you are at a roadblock in your growth, what do you ever expect to gain from playing against people around the same rank? The level of play that you will constantly be exposed to will be at the same level. As a result, you will just continue to play to play moves of that level. When playing a stronger player in an even game, you find out very quickly when something you thought was a &#8220;correct&#8221; move is actually just a bad idea.<br />
<em>&#8220;Okay fine, but I play handicap games! Shouldn&#8217;t that be enough?&#8221;</em><br />
Nope. The one thing you have to remember is that handicap games are very difficult to learn from since handicap games are lopsided by nature. Your opponent will make a lot of unusual plays that may seem &#8220;high level&#8221; to you, but in reality they are overplays that would only hurt you in the long run if you try and learn from them.<br />
<em>&#8220;But my rank will drop like crazy!!!&#8221;</em><br />
Even though stronger players are the ones who really should be worrying about having their ranks messed up, my idea is centered around the idea of playing free games with stronger players. By doing this, you will find more opponents to play and not have to worry about your own rank.<br />
<em>&#8220;Okay, but I don&#8217;t know any stronger players and it&#8217;s not like I would even know why my move is bad or their move is better.&#8221;</em><br />
Fair enough. This is why I recommend that anyone who is unable to obtain any kind of private lessons to join the Advanced Study Room. It is a completely free insei-type program where you will have many opportunities to play people that are stronger than you. In addition, most of the stronger players are always happy to help you review a game. And as if that wasn&#8217;t enough, you can actually earn prizes if you do well!<br />
So bottom line: if you feel like you&#8217;re in a rut, it&#8217;s time to push your limits, expand your horizons, and have your eyes opened up by stronger players so that you can better grasp what areas you need to work on to reach the next level.</p>

It seems I can&#8217;t seem to get my wrapped up properly in a game tonight. Every time I try to play online, it has been a miserable game each and every time. I always start out playing solid, and then always seem to mess up later on.<br />
On the upside, playing with Todd and Keith today was insightful and I learned a lot. It&#8217;s still frustrating how little I feel that I&#8217;ve grown in the (almost) two months time frame. I clearly haven&#8217;t been studying as much as I should have been lately. I should probably modify my regimen for improving my abilities.<br />
Five more days until the second month is up&#8230;. sigh&#8230;.</p>

Bleh. I&#8217;ve failed so far as to keeping regular blog posts once I go up to Baltimore on the weekends&#8230;. I&#8217;ll need to fix that. But regardless, I played quite a bit with Todd over the past couple days&#8230; and I have to say it&#8217;s been frustrating yet enlightening. I know I&#8217;ve said this multiple times in the past&#8230; but I&#8217;d say that the implications of the line that &#8220;Go is 98% patience&#8221; is &#8220;Read ahead you idiot.&#8221;<br />
I&#8217;m not the first nor will I be the last to say that I believe that Go really does reveal a lot about a person&#8217;s character. What I&#8217;ve realized&#8230; is that I&#8217;m not as patient as I thought I was. I like to get things done quickly and to use talent and intuition to hope for the best result. The only problem is that this mindset doesn&#8217;t translate well in Go and in the bigger picture&#8230; life.<br />
Second epiphany is that my asinine &#8220;wanna-be pro&#8221; self keeps trying to create all these clever trick plays (e.g. shortage of liberty situations or awesome snapbacks). What does that mean for a player still in the DDK who plays an opponent of shodan strength? Complete and utter failure. As Todd so kindly reminded me, &#8220;Go is not about killing stones&#8230;.&#8221; I must&#8217;ve heard and read this about a hundred times since I&#8217;ve started, yet still it still has not sunk into my brain&#8230;. sigh.<br />
So what do I take away from all of this? Two things:</p>
<ol>
<li>Train my patience as a person so that it will not only impact my ability as a Go player, but the rest of my life as well.</li>
<li>Focus on the fundamentals of Go. Stay away from trying to do anything crazy until the basic are set and stone in my style of play.</li>
</ol>
