				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Recently, I have been trying to figure out how to resolve my problem of being undisciplined when it comes to reading out sequences or figuring out what move to play next.<br />
One of the first solutions I came up with was to simply try and practice more problems, but it didn&#8217;t really seem to help much. So the next thing I tried was reading more theoretical go books in hopes of having something click inside me that would all of a sudden fix my problem. That didn&#8217;t work out too well either.<br />
After some thought, I realized that my problem is actually multidimensional.</p>
<ol>
<li><span style="line-height: 13px;"><strong>Physical Energy</strong> &#8211; I have been a lot more tired than I would like to admit lately. Though I didn&#8217;t recognize it at the time, it was playing a major role in my being nonchalant about what or where I played next. Â </span></li>
<li><strong>Multiple Points of Focus</strong> &#8211; Those who know me personally will attest to the fact that I am the type who is constantly trying to multi-task and can jump from one thing to another in a blink of an eye. While that can be useful in certain contexts, it is actually becoming detrimental to my go in the long run (along with other things, but let&#8217;s face it, go is the first priority here. =P).</li>
<li><strong>Overload / Burnout</strong> &#8211; As a result of the previous two points, it is only natural that my brain would eventually become overloaded and simply burnout.</li>
</ol>
<p>It&#8217;s clear that I need a reboot on my system and approach to things. To start though, I&#8217;ve resolved to achieve two goals: (1) Simplify &amp; Focus and (2) Gain back the physical energy that I once had.</p>
