				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So lately, I&#8217;ve been playing pool with my family, and I have to say that I realized how accustomed I&#8217;ve become to the manner of play in go. For those who aren&#8217;t familiar with pool, a player can theoretically play the entire game from start to finish without ever letting the opponent have a single turn. Can you imagine how I felt as a go player?! It&#8217;s as if I passed every time an opponent put down a stone. AHHHHHHH!!!!!<br />
With that random anecdote, I&#8217;m still happy to report that my ranked game sabbatical has continued to be sustain. Although in all honesty, with the league games diminishing in availability, I am starting to feel the urge to start playing ranked games again. I&#8217;ve even resorted to playing two games of blitz go yesterday (which was a complete and utter mistake might I add). Â Playing league games consistently has certainly weakened my ability to play blitz go properly, but I think that&#8217;s a plus more than a negative.<br />
On that note, the month is nearly over! I&#8217;m not sure whether or not I want to continue abstaining from ranked games or not, so I guess I&#8217;ll see when the time comes.<br />
Hope everyone had a great holiday!</p>
