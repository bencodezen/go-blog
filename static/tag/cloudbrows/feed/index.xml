				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 style="text-align: center;">Introduction</h2>
<p>For this week&#8217;s go meditation, I am pleased to share with you another game from my friend and rival Nate. In this game, there is a huge struggle between both players to take the lead and resist each other&#8217;s intentions. In addition, though this game is won by resignation, I cannot stress enough how challenging this game was. I can definitely say with confidence that I gave this game everything I had that night. I can only hope that you can appreciate this incredible game as much as I did. It was quite an amazing journey.<a href="//wp-content/uploads/2013/10/2013.10.28-MGM-33.sgf"><br />

<p style="text-align: center;">If you make each move in consideration of the whole board, you will find that your games become far more interesting and you develop an entirely new appreciation for the game.</p>

<p>For today&#8217;s go meditation, we continue with another game between cloudbrows and myself! Though not nearly as explosive as the last game we played, I think that this game is an excellent example of poor attacking along and the importance of whole board thinking. In addition, I am trying to expand the breadth of the review with more commentary than before in hopes of expanding the range of players that will be able to understand and gain something from my reviews. Let me know if there&#8217;s anything more I can do!<a href="//wp-content/uploads/2013/08/2013.08.05-MGM-21.sgf"><br />

<p>For today&#8217;s go meditation, we return to even games as I show another game from my kadoban with long time friend and rival Nate. As he humorously commented after the game was over, it seems that him and I have a difficult time playing &#8220;nice games.&#8221; It seems that we either have these all or nothing games that almost always end in someone going down in glorious fire. At least from my end, I don&#8217;t ever intentionally try to force the game into that kind of direction; but perhaps my fighting style is what causes it. With that said, I hope you enjoy this week&#8217;s game review.<a href="//wp-content/uploads/2013/08/2013.08.05-MGM-21.sgf"><br />

<p style="text-align: center;"><b>Resigning because you failed to kill a group is inexcusable. One should have the decency to at least count before resigning.</b></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Last night I played a fun game against my friend Nate, but was definitely demolished by the end of the game. A 40 point loss&#8230; hahaha. Thought I admit that there was definitely a degree of disappointment in myself for playing so terribly, there is a silver lining in my complete failure.<br />
So my experiment failed miserably, but I am sure that the experience I gained with be valuable in the future. In addition,Â I am happy knowing that my mistakes were not reading mistakes this time around. Though I may have made plenty of strategic and whole board errors, reducing the number of reading mistakes should prove to be very lethal once I take care of my flawed strategies.Â For those wondering about the kifu, it&#8217;ll be featured on a Monday Go Meditation in a couple of weeks.<br />
Meanwhile, I have also decided to take my sensei&#8217;s advice and take the time to really watch <a href="http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCYMY6j5mUvPMPzvN5bxuKA">Battousai&#8217;s</a> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLv8NkgCbtGytYtHKchRMLh9l2KVlqW1z6">3D Tygem Series</a>. Perhaps I can follow in his footsteps and gain sudden insight into the game through watching the series. Not sure how it will go, but I&#8217;ll be sure to let you know if anything changes.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In lieu of my last post on <a title="The Desire toÂ Lose" href="//the-desire-to-lose/">the desire to lose</a>, I thought it would only be appropriate that I title this blog post after a marvelous game I played on Monday. It&#8217;s already slated for a Monday Go Meditation, so more on that game in a couple of weeks!<br />
With that being said, I&#8217;m sure that some of you have noticed that the email subscription widget on the right has changed a bit. And in case you didn&#8217;t, here&#8217;s the basic rundown!</p>
<ol>
<li><span style="line-height: 13px;">E-mail newsletters now have a new look and feel that should make the reading process more enjoyable!</span></li>
<li>You can now choose the frequency at which you want to receive your email newsletter!</li>
</ol>
<p>The only drawback to the plugin I&#8217;m using is that it isn&#8217;t very easy to switch to a different list, so if anyone would like to switch the frequency of their newsletter, feel free to contact me or go ahead and unsubscribe to the current list you&#8217;re on and resubscribe to the new one you want to be on. Either one works.<br />
Finally, as you all have definitely noticed, I am on a book review rampage. I&#8217;ve gotten in a really great study groove, but I&#8217;m starting to feel the need to take it down a couple of notches since I have a few books I would like to spend more time on. Anyhow, more on that later on. Need to get some studying in before I pass out. XD<br />
<em>PS. To all my first email subscribers (who were all immediately being updated whenever I posted something), in order to prevent everyone from feeling like I am spamming your inbox, I switched everyone over to the Daily Newsletter in order to keep my emails to one per day. If you would like to be switched back to the Immediate Newsletter, just let me know!</em></p>
