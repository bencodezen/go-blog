				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It&#8217;s only Day 2 of my <a title="Korean Training Reboot!" href="//korean-training-reboot/">Korean Training Reboot</a> and I&#8217;m happy to report that I am really enjoying this series. Although I could theoretically fly through most of the beginning books, I have been taking more time to be very thorough with the content. I&#8217;m hoping that this will help to reveal any inconsistencies with my basics as I work my way through the series.<br />
In terms of progress though, I&#8217;m almost done with <em>Level Up! &#8211; Volume 1 </em>and plan to post the review in the near future. For my preliminary findings though, I&#8217;m 99% sure that this series will be awarded the best introductory series to go in my book. Although it might be written and designed for kids, I have a feeling that any adult who goes through this entire series will rise through the ranks much faster than by studying any other book.<br />
This is just a preliminary analysis though, so I will let you know if my opinion changes when I&#8217;m done with the series. =D</p>
