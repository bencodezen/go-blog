So I think I have to revise my one post a day rule to exclude book reviews because at the rate I&#8217;m releasing book reviews, I&#8217;m never going to get a chance to write for the sake of writing. Haha. With that said, let&#8217;s unload some things off my brain.<br />
I recently re-watched the episode in <em>Hikaru No Go</em> (Episode 66 &#8211; &#8220;Fateful Encounter&#8221;) where they do the prelude to the whole series. For those who might not remember, the episode features a child who recently is crowned Child Meijin and wants to challenge Akira to prove he is the strongest. Right before the game, he pridefully challenges Akira with the following statement:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Child Meijin: When I win, tell everyone, &#8220;I lost to Hideki Isobe.&#8221;</p>
<p>Though most might shy away from the idea of boasting to everyone that they lost, Akira&#8217;s reaction reminded me of something I had forgotten long ago.</p>
<blockquote><p>Akira (with the utmost excited face): I will! I sure will!</p></blockquote>
<p>How long ago has it been since I last sought out a match where I would be proud to say, &#8220;Look! I lost, but it was a great game!&#8221; When was the last time I felt a desire to lose?<br />
Nowadays, I just slink away like a dog with his tail between his legs hoping secretly hoping to quickly nab a win afterwards to cover up my shame. What a pitiful state I&#8217;ve fallen into&#8230; Haha. No matter though, today is a new day! I will return back to the battlefield of Tygem and restart my training against dan players! Ikuzo!</p>
