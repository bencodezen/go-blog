<h2>Thoughts</h2>
<p>Overall, it&#8217;s been a rather eventful week since the ASR League was wrapping up and the final points were being tallied. The good news is that I managed to get promoted to Alpha!!! Woot woot! I know that some people will say, &#8220;It&#8217;s easy to get to Alpha. Just play a lot of games.&#8221; To you I say that may be true if you actually win some of your games, but otherwise it&#8217;s near impossible since your points rack up so slowly compared to people who win a majority of their games.<br />
Since February is going to be a short month, it seems I will be going on another ranked game sabbatical since I will have my hands full trying to stay in Alpha class and also keeping up with my study schedule for the month. Not to mention that <a title="North American Go Convention!!!" href="//north-american-go-convention/">North American Go Convention</a> is this month as well, and that will take out four days of studying/playing. So lots to do this month, and very little time. Something&#8217;s got to give right? =) Here&#8217;s to the start of a crazy month! Ikuzo!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There&#8217;s one thing I&#8217;ve learned recently is that leagues are a fantastic place for experimental games. Not convinced? Three reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li><span style="line-height: 13px;">They are free games. You have nothing to lose.</span></li>
<li>More often than not, you are playing people stronger than you. If you&#8217;re going to lose anyways, why not do so while learning something new?</li>
<li>The reviews of your games will yield more nuggets of wisdom than normal since you are trying to break into new territory.</li>
</ol>
<p>My record thus far has been pretty abysmal, but like the title of this post suggests, I feel like I&#8217;ve been going out with a bang each time. Don&#8217;t get me wrong, the losing aspect still stings a little bit; but I am comforted by the idea that the games are not terribly lopsided as a whole.<br />
Here&#8217;s to hoping I can hang on to my place in the Beta class&#8230; *fingers crossed*</p>

<p>When I woke up this morning to check to see if my <a title="Advanced Study Room" href="http://www.advancedstudyroom.com/ASR/">ASR</a> class had changed, I was pleasantly surprised to find out that I was actually promoted to Beta II!!! Definitely wasn&#8217;t expecting it and I&#8217;m sure it was because of the need to fill in the class after people were either demoted or dropped. Nonetheless, this is great news for me because it means that I&#8217;ve managed to graduate two classes since I started in July! Although it would be nice to be promoted to Alpha class next month, my goal for this month is to simply stay in the Beta class for now.<br />
With the upcoming <a title="North American Go Convention!!!" href="//north-american-go-convention/">North American Go Convention (NAGC)</a> in February 2013, I realized that I am extremely motivated to find out how strong I can get before the tournament/professional event. More often than not, I have found that although it is always exciting to hear professionals give lectures, I was always too weak to really appreciate their commentary and insight.<br />
As a result, I have decided on a new route of study for the month of December: <strong>no ranked games</strong>. The reason for this is because no matter how hard I try, I am still stuck in the state where ranked games still cause a bit of anxiety regarding its impact on my online rank. Although I hope that this will no longer be an issue one day, I know that this impacts my ability to try new things and simply play better go instead of trying to win.<br />
&#8220;But Ben, you&#8217;ve tried this before! And you failed miserably every time!&#8221;<br />
You are correct and incorrect at the same time. This time around, instead of simply going on &#8220;sabbatical&#8221; from playing go, I will primarily focus on league games and any free games that stronger players would be happy to play with me and help me review afterwards! With this approach in conjunction with my study of the game, I&#8217;m hoping to see results by the month of January.<br />
If this works out well, I may even continue doing this till the NAGC! But like many things in life, one step at a time. Wish me luck!</p>
