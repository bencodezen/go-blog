				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Earlier today, I was reading <em>Otake&#8217;s Secrets of Strategy</em> by Hideo Otake 9P when I stumbled upon an interesting quote:</p>
<blockquote><p>In the opening there are no predetermined shapes. &#8211; Otake 9P</p></blockquote>
<p>I know that it might seem terribly obvious to some of you, but it struck me as rather profound when I read it.<br />
Otake was discussing the fact that many amateur players play joseki faithfully believing that since they are joseki it can&#8217;t be that bad. He considers this a huge flaw with our rationale because joseki are only as good as the position it was meant to be used in. So when he said that &#8220;there are no predetermined shapes&#8221; in the opening, it opened my eyes as to how unimaginative I have been with my openings lately.<br />
Perhaps this quote will cause me to start playing some very odd experimental games where I lose and drop rank; but if it means that I&#8217;m developing my own creative style as I play, I have a feeling it will be an enjoyable journey: win or lose.</p>
