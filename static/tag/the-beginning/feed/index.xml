				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Welcome to BenGoZen! As you might&#8217;ve read in the description, this blog is for anyone looking for some personalized Go experience and advice. In case some of you haven&#8217;t had the pleasure of reading ChiyoDad&#8217;s blog, he has about three years of blogging logged in. Even though he has some great information, I thought I&#8217;d take to a blog with a more personal touch and hopefully more guidance for those who are new to the game or are looking to improve.<br />
So in case you are wondering how the blog got its name, it&#8217;s quite simple.<br />
Ben &#8211; My name<br />
Go &#8211; The name of the game and a pun on the verb as well.<br />
+ Zen &#8211; The calming state I get when playing the game.<br />
&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;<br />
= BenGoZen!<br />
In addition, it&#8217;s also three mono-syllabic words strung together with a rhyme which I thought would be catchy. (Hopefully I won&#8217;t be the only one)<br />
As the blog posts fill up, be sure to use the search box if you are searching for something specific. I&#8217;ll keep the titles simple so that you&#8217;ll hopefully find what you&#8217;re looking for without much difficulty. (e.g. If you want book reviews, type &#8220;book reviews&#8221;)<br />
In addition, any links that I post up on the sidebars are sites that I personally have verified and believe to be useful or reliable. This is particularly directed at the &#8220;Places to Buy Go Stuff&#8221; list since I wouldn&#8217;t want you purchasing from anywhere that I had no experience with. Also, the links and blogs will be exclusively English for now since I assume a number of players reading my blog won&#8217;t know Japanese of Chinese. If there is a demand for it, let me know and I&#8217;ll start posting those blogs too.<br />
Sorry for the long introduction, but I hope it gets you a better idea of what BenGoZen is all about and how to best use it for your Go needs.</p>
