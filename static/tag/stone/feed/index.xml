So the first part of my package from <a href="http://www.surroundinggamemovie.com/">The Surrounding Game</a> came in last week! As you can see above, I got my black t-shirt, white stone from the game between Daniel Ko and Calvin Sun (that determined who received the first invitation to the AGA-Tygem professional certification tournament), the correlating game record, along with a postcard as well! Still waiting on the poster and DVD (although who isn&#8217;t waiting eagerly for it), but it was still great to get at least some of it to start!<br />
On a different note, I think that I realized that while my attacking skills are rather abysmal, I have really come to terms with the fact that I may actually just be very poor at understanding what the board is telling me. In other words, am I able to look at any game in progress and already begin to get an idea as to the picture that is being painted? Is this a game of competing moyos? Or perhaps is Black behind even though his central moyo is looking enormous?<br />
More on this when I have managed to put more words to what I&#8217;m feeling, but here are some close ups of the the stuff I received:<br />
