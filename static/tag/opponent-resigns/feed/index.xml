<p><strong>Overall</strong><br />
The feeling of being in control of the board is a magnificent feeling. There wasn&#8217;t a single point in this game where I wasn&#8217;t making my moves recklessly. Each move was thought out, and had a purpose that even had some reading behind it. (I know&#8230; crazy right? After all, what crazy player reads out moves when he figures out where he wants to go&#8230;. absolute insanity&#8230;)<br />
<strong>My Opponent</strong><br />
I thought he was a great 9k, and probably in reality more of an 8k. He played a lot of unexpected moves that left me questioning how I should respond. Each move was very interesting and I most certainly look forward to playing him again.<br />
<strong>Mistakes</strong><br />
It feels like it&#8217;s been forever since I was last able to say that I don&#8217;t feel like I made any mistakes this game. The only two areas that were somewhat &#8220;unexpected&#8221; were:</p>
<ul>
<li>Move 50 (G14) &#8211; Although this ended up working out for me, I will definitely be the first to admit that this was more of an gut type move than a totally intentional one. My reading was shortsighted by the fact that the F12 group had aji that could be used against me.</li>
<li>Move 62 (K13) &#8211; In retrospect, I think this move would&#8217;ve been better used by extending at H10. It would&#8217;ve been a more proactive move while also protecting the cut at J13.</li>
<li>Move 65 (A17) &#8211; I had read out falsifying the last eye properly, but the atari definitely caught me off guard. I&#8217;m glad that it only cost me 6 points instead of the entire C17 group.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Prized Moments</strong><br />
There&#8217;s no feeling like setting up a scenario where regardless of which choice opponent makes, you&#8217;ll happily take the other&#8230;</p>
<ul>
<li>Move 36 (F12) &#8211; Can you see what I was preparing for?</li>
<li>Move 60 (F15) &#8211; The forcing move of C12 was unexpected and got my opponent the first true eye. Thankfully he ended in gote and I could play this move!</li>
<li>Move 70 (B9) &#8211; Although this may have seemed slow, this move ensured the life of my group so that I could attack or reduce as I pleased! A Lee Changho type move if I may so say myself!</li>
</ul>
