				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As I’ve been fighting off the onslaught of work and priorities that keep coming my way, I hate to admit that I’ve fallen quite behind on my go studies. In fact, they have become practically non-existent. I think the most exposure I’ve gotten to go is flipping through the new books that have been arriving. However, that cannot even begin to amount to any noteworthy type of study.<br />
And to be honest, it’s not so much that I don’t want to study or play. In fact, I would love nothing more than to dedicate a nice chunk of time each day to my go studies. However, since that has been nearly impossible, I’ve been wracking my brain for ways to make progress before an obscene amount of time has passed since I last studied go.<br />
As I was walking outside this morning, a thought occurred to me, “If you’re not moving forward, you’re moving backwards.” (Of course, one’s progress in go is not even remotely that linear, but you get the idea.) And though this might sound repetitive to some, once again I realized the necessity of taking steps forward. And at this point, it doesn’t even matter what direction I’m taking the step in. As long as I am making efforts to move forward, it will be more valuable than simply waiting for the perfect time for me to pick go back up the way I want to.<br />
So to those who are also caught up in the whirlwind of the responsibilities of adult life and being independent, I challenge you to take the smallest of steps forward (even if it is as simple as doing 10 easy life and death problems a day). For me, I will return to the Jump Level Up series to provide some structure for myself.<br />
I’ll be sure to keep you posted as I begin making my comeback.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>This week has been very sparse in terms of study and playing, but extremely heavy in regards to writing (if you didn’t notice with the Weekly Go Wednesday article). And though my time has been a bit more biased towards writing, I don’t think any of you are complaining. Haha.<br />
It’s taken some time to break into my productivity system, but the cogs and wheels are starting to mesh together better now. I’m much more aware of where my time is going along with how I’m progressing as a whole in life now. Whole board thinking. See that?<br />
I’m looking forward to when my entire system works effortlessly and I can really amp up my go training. No matter though. Slow and steady wins the race.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I played the second round of my Yunguseng match tonight. To be honest, it was a game of mixed feelings. Though I hate to admit it, I&#8217;m not quite out of my slump yet. I could definitely feel it as I started getting antsy when the game began. I started being negative and worried that I would lose again. Yet on the other hand, there were moments where I managed to give my game some life as I surged forth with a desire to attack and try to harass my opponent&#8217;s group with as much vigor as I could muster up.<br />

<div id='glift_display1' style='height:500px; width:100%; position:relative;'></div>
<script type='text/javascript'>gliftWidget = glift.create({"divId":"glift_display1","sgf":"http:\/\/bengozen.com\/\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/07\/YSD-S9-Round12.sgf","display":{"theme":"DEFAULT","drawBoardCoords":"1"}});</script>

<p style="text-align: center;">[download label=&#8221;Download Kifu&#8221;]//wp-content/uploads/2014/07/YSD-S9-Round12.sgf[/download]
<p>It was a bit weird being in this bi-polar/gray area of feeling like my go was rather aimless, having it spring back to life, making bad moves where I was completely off with my reading, and then having lively energy again. Then again I guess this is all part of trying to put the pieces together again. They don&#8217;t quite fit together at the moment, but I&#8217;m optimistic that they will become whole once again.<br />
And though I would normally be concerned with how fast it would take or when it would happen, I’ve realized that doing so will not do me any good. I’ll just keep working on my weaknesses and play to the best of my ability. Everything will fall into place in due time.<br />
PS. There won&#8217;t be any detailed commentary for this game, but I just wanted to mention that there are quite a number of mistakes and overplays in this game. So in case anyone wants to point out things like my lower left corner was supposed to die and so forth, no worries, got it all in the review.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 style="text-align: left;">Overview</h2>
<p>Once again I&#8217;ve decided to trim down on my training regimen in order to up the quality of training. This means more time spent on each topic as well as increasing repetition in order to further solidify what I&#8217;m learning. In other words, I&#8217;m no longer simply looking to find out what the correct answer is; but to instead really try to immerse myself in it so the reading ability becomes more ingrained in me.<br />
In terms of gameplay, it has been a rather abysmal week. I got into a weird mood and ended up losing 5 games in a row. It was pretty awful considering my go deteriorated to the point where my final game was a resignation against a 4k. Playing on tilt is just not a pretty sight for me at all. Haha. But on the upside, I did manage to recollect myself enough to manage a win for my <a title="Yunguseng Dojang Official Site" href="http://www.yunguseng.com/">Yunguseng Dojang</a> match. So hooray for that!<br />
And as <a title="Taking a Second Look at the Blog" href="//taking-second-look-blog/">mentioned earlier this week</a>, there are some changes coming up on the blog that should hopefully improve the reading experience and value that this blog has. So I&#8217;ve been working on that as well and trying to iron out some of the changes I&#8217;m trying to make. Fingers crossed it goes smoothly!</p>
<h2>Training Regimen</h2>
<ul>
<li>Play 3 games a week.</li>
<li>Complete 1 section of <a title="Book Review: Jump Level Up 1" href="//book-review-jump-level-1/">Jump Level Up 1</a> per day.</li>
<li>Work on <em>Get Strong at Life and Death</em>.</li>
<li>Work on <a title="Book Review: Get Strong at Tesuji" href="//book-review-get-strong-tesuji/">Get Strong at Tesuji</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Games</h2>
<ul>
<li><a title="IGS PandaNet Official Site" href="http://www.pandanet-igs.com/">Pandanet-IGS</a> &#8211; 1 game</li>
<li><a title="KGS Website" href="http://www.gokgs.com/">KGS</a> &#8211;  9 games</li>
<li><a title="Dragon Go Server - BenGoZen's Profile" href="http://www.dragongoserver.net/userinfo.php?uid=60385">DGS</a> &#8211; 6 ongoing games</li>
<li><a title="Online Go Server - BenGoZen's Profile" href="http://online-go.com/user/view/549/BenGoZen">OGS</a> &#8211;  6 ongoing games</li>
</ul>
<h2>Books</h2>
<ul>
<li><a title="Book Review: Jump Level Up 1" href="//book-review-jump-level-1/">Jump Level Up 1</a> by Baduktopia</li>
<li><em>Get Strong at Life and Death</em> by Richard Bozulich</li>
<li><a title="Book Review: Get Strong at Tesuji" href="//book-review-get-strong-tesuji/">Get Strong at Tesuji</a> by Richard Bozulich</li>
</ul>
<h2>Lessons Learned</h2>
<ul>
<li>Playing on tilt has consequences&#8230; like dropping two stones in rank on KGS. Hahaha.</li>
<li>Take all your opponents seriously regardless of their rank. I&#8217;ve posted about this multiple times, but it&#8217;s come to bite me in the butt again.</li>
<li>There is a huge difference between winning a game and crushing your opponent. Taking one attitude versus another has a profound impact on your approach to the game mentally, but more on this later.</li>
<li>This might sound utterly basic, but I seriously need to use my brain more when I play. I miss the most common variations in my blitz reading. I read one variation and think it&#8217;s good and fail to consider other obvious alternatives. Oy vey.</li>
</ul>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 style="text-align: left;">Overview</h2>
<p>The theme of this week has been: <strong>Ben needs to improve his reading abilities</strong>. Haha. Many thanks to all those who commented on my <a title="Returning to the Fundamentals" href="//returning-fundamentals/">WGW post</a> and helped me refocus my time and energy on the correct area of weakness. I even had the pleasure of hanging out with local go player Justin (AGA 7d) who helped to straighten me out a bit. It was a fun time of playing and going over some variations on joseki that I should be familiar with. It certainly showed me that there is still much more I can do to improve, which is always motivating.<br />
Finally, as I continue trying to improve this blog, I have to keep in mind the time and energy required for each post along with whether or not that material I&#8217;m writing is even relevant anymore. After all, all of this is meant for your reading enjoyment (and a small percentage for chronicling my own journey)! As a result, over the next few weeks, I&#8217;ll be asking for feedback on what you see on this blog to help optimize everything.<br />
To start, I wanted to do a quick poll on your thoughts on this weekly series: Friday Go Forward. So if you don&#8217;t mind, please leave a comment below to let me know if you think this series is worth keeping around and/or anything I could do to improve it (i.e., specific things you&#8217;d like to see me talk about in my Overview section since I&#8217;m sometimes unsure of what to write in here)<strong>.</strong> And if you think it&#8217;s good the way it is, it would be good to hear that as well. Thanks!</p>

<li>I really need to work on my reading abilities if I want to take my game to the next level.</li>

<h2 style="text-align: left;">Overview</h2>
<p>During the past few weeks, I ended up skewing my training to playing games and sacrificing study in order to re-acclimate myself to playing games again. As a result, my weaknesses became very clear as I would lose game after game after game.<br />
After <a title="Discovering My “Master Wu”" href="//discovering-master-wu/">discovering my Master Wu</a>, my training has once again gone under another stage of growth as I really begin to immerse myself in practicing &#8220;deep learning&#8221; as is discussed in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Talent-Code-Greatness-Grown/dp/055380684X">The Talent Code</a>.  And though it&#8217;s too early to tell if it&#8217;s working, I feel like the wheels of progress are beginning to turn. Fingers crossed that I&#8217;m not wrong. Haha.</p>

<h2>Lessons Learned</h2>
<ul>
<li>Though difficult to grasp, learning how to make proper trades throughout your game is one of the key milestones to being a strong player. This is particularly evident in the way Go Seigen plays (and yes admittedly difficult to do).</li>
<li>As I replay more and more of Go Seigen&#8217;s kifu, I&#8217;ve realized how constricted my go has become. It is missing the freedom that is so glaringly exists in Go Seigen&#8217;s games.</li>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 style="text-align: left;">Overview</h2>
<p>This week has been a great continuation of my new philosophy of gaining <a title="Experience on the Battlefield" href="//experience-on-the-battlefield/">experience on the battlefield</a>. I&#8217;ve always felt that experience on the battlefield was necessary, but it wasn&#8217;t until I really started taking it seriously that I&#8217;ve come to understand the depth of that fundamental truth. In fact, as a result of me playing more games (and of course losing more often), I was actually able to win my third round of <a title="Yunguseng Dojang Official Site" href="http://www.yunguseng.com/">Yunguseng Dojang</a>! So within a week, I already have some proof of the method working!<br />
As you will notice, my training regimen has been trimmed a bit. Unlike the past however, the reason I&#8217;ve decided to trim it down is not because it&#8217;s burning me out or anything of the sort, but instead it&#8217;s a matter of having some other activities I need to prioritize at the moment. And to be clear, what I write in the &#8220;Training Regimen&#8221; section is what I am requiring myself to work on everyday. When I have some extra time, then I will be doing other things as well.<br />
Hope that all is well with everyone and that you all have a great Memorial Day weekend!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 style="text-align: center;">Friday Go Forward: Week 55</h2>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Ever since getting back from Hong Kong, this week has been consumed with getting back on track with life and not to mention getting readjusted from a 12 hour jet lag. (Yes it was quite painful to switch back and forth.) However, in the process of picking things back up, I have had the opportunity to start fine tuning a number of my daily processes in order to maximize my output with minimal input. For example, I&#8217;ve actually managed to start becoming more efficient and accustomed to doing a set of go problems every day now. In fact, if I go most of the day without doing any problems, I usually find myself itching to grab my phone and practice some before bed.<br />
In addition, I&#8217;ve had a bit of a self-revelation in regards to my destructive habit of <a title="WGW 35: Stop Overthinking" href="//wgw-35-stop-overthinking/">overthinking</a> things. Since that post, I have really been trying to streamline my mental processes so that I am not hindered by any self-doubt or overly cumbersome obstacles that I create for myself. And even though it&#8217;s only been a couple of days since that post, I feel that it has had a rather large impact on my life.<br />
Anyhow, I also wanted to take the opportunity to mention an event going on in DC on April 12th, 2014 &#8211; 10:30am to 6:00pm &#8211; <a title="Sakura Matsuri Street Festival DC Site" href="http://www.sakuramatsuri.org/">54th Annual Sakura Matsuri Japanese Street Festival</a>. I had the pleasure of volunteering to teach go there last year, but failed to ever get around to writing about it. Long story short though, I had a great time and it was a fantastic experience. So if you&#8217;re in the DC area and have some time to come out for it, I&#8217;d highly recommend it and you will probably find me teaching go at the go kiosk. Hope to see you there!</p>
<h2>Training Regimen</h2>
<ul>
<li><b>Reading Ability &#8211; </b>Work on the tasks below until whichever comes first.*
<ul>
<li>Work on go problems for 30 minutes.</li>
<li>Work on 300 go problems.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>*<em>This is a way to split the difference between task based versus time based training. If you work faster than normal, and can get through 300 (or whichever number you decide on) problems. Kudos to you. But in the event you&#8217;re having trouble and need more time to work on the problems, just keep at it until 30 minutes is up (or whatever time you think it best for you).</em></p>
<h2>Games</h2>
<ul>
<li><a title="KGS Website" href="http://www.gokgs.com/">KGS</a> &#8211;  1 game</li>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When I decided to return to ranked games, I will have to be honest in that I expected my graph to just shoot up. In fact, I&#8217;ve even developed a reputation in the ASR League for being a &#8220;3k Killer.&#8221; So it should obviously follow that any even games with 6 and 7 kyus should be something I can win in my sleep right? <em><b>WRONG!</b></em><br />
For those who don&#8217;t follow me on KGS, you&#8217;ll notice that my rank graph is well&#8230; a bit different from what I imagined it would be. xD<br />
<figure id="attachment_1731" style="width: 300px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2013/01/rank2.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-1731" alt="rank2" src="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2013/01/rank2.png?resize=300%2C184" width="300" height="184" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Notice how it drops at the end? Twice?!</figcaption></figure>
Like anyone else, I was really frustrated by my progress. I mean, why was I having such a difficult time beating 6-7ks when I actually managed to beat stronger players in even games from time to time? I tried to make all kinds of excuses: the stronger players were underestimating me, my opponents were just lucky I made mistakes, I was in an off mood, etc. But after I realized how those were all just external attributions for things I had control over, I decided to look inward for the answer.<br />
<span id="more-1726"></span><br />
After some soul searching, I realized that the question I needed to ask myself was: Why are my ASR games so vastly different from my ranked games?<br />
At first, I thought that it might be because ranked games carried more pressure and so forth. While that may carry some validity, I know that it can&#8217;t be the excuse for my poor play against 6-7ks. I had to find an answer that I would be happy with. So the most obvious thing to do was compare my ranked games and my free games on ASR League.<br />
When I did, I noticed the following trends:</p>
<ul>
<li>ASR games represented a calm style that has proven quite formidable against stronger opponents.</li>
<li>Ranked games were extremely aggressive and resulted in either large wins or losses.</li>
<li>If I lost a ranked game, I would feel compelled to keep playing in an effort to &#8220;redeem&#8221; myself.&#8221;</li>
<li>This usually led to me accepting games that averaged around 10 &#8211; 15 minutes main time in order to get a quick win.</li>
<li>I usually played ranked games when procrastinating other work I should have been doing.</li>
<li>I never felt bad about losing a game where I was able to give my full efforts into each move.</li>
</ul>
<h3 style="text-align: center">EUREKA! ALL MY PROBLEMS CAN BE TRACED TO ONE THING: TIME.</h3>
<p>Here&#8217;s why:</p>
<ol>
<li>Since my nature is already prone to getting into massive fights, having the time pressure only exasperates my bad habit.</li>
<li>If I have a bitter loss, then the aggressive tendency gets worse and I start playing games with even shorter time frames.</li>
<li>The shorter time frames make me more frantic and I end up playing moves that I &#8220;think&#8221; will work out, but any closer inspection would prove otherwise.</li>
</ol>
<p>As a result, I resolve to have the minimum requirements when I play: 30 minutes main time with at least 3 periods of 30 second byoyomi.* Anything shorter than that has a good chance to throw me off course. And until I have reinforced the fundamentals in every fiber, I will stick with these guidelines in order to prevent myself from self-destructing.**After all, every game I play is a game that I can be proud of, regardless of whether I win or lose.<br />
*For other players, I would recommend a bare minimum of 20 minutes main time because 10 minutes really ends up being more like blitz than anything else.<br />
**The one exception to this rule will be my Tygem 5-dan experiment. =D</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Well everyone, looks like this will be my final post for 2012. As I look back at 2012 and all the craziness that has come with it, I am definitely glad that go is once again an important part of my life. It&#8217;s been a fun year with me getting back into go and then bringing the go blog back full force.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">In terms of how my progress, here&#8217;s my rank graph for 2012.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2012/12/2012-rank.png"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-1566" alt="2012 rank" src="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2012/12/2012-rank.png?resize=476%2C204" width="476" height="204" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><em>Note: I did not play a single ranked game in December though. So the graph seems a little weird&#8230; haha.</em></p>
<p>In terms of my big accomplishment, it would have to be that I made it into mid-SDK range. I must admit though, it seems like just yesterday when I was playing as a 10k. Not sure I feel much stronger though. =D<br />
For next year, my goal is to reach a solid dan status on KGS. Ambitious? Yes. Impossible? Don&#8217;t know till I try. =D<br />
<span id="more-1561"></span><br />
In regards to the blog, here are some things that that you can look forward to:</p>
<ol>
<li>Weekly Go Wednesdays will be back starting this very week, so please submit any topics or ideas that you might have!</li>
<li>More book reviews!</li>
<li>Go equipment review updates and new additions!</li>
<li>Guides for all players of all different budget sizes!</li>
</ol>
<p>Finally, I think it is only appropriate that I end the year with a game that I had the pleasure of playing over the weekend. It was a hard fought game where I experimented with a number of ideas. It&#8217;s a game that I am proud to include in my final kifu for 2012. As the title of this post suggest, this is a game where we both fought it out till the very last point.<br />
