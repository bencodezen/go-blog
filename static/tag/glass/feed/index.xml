[expand title=&#8221;Synopsis&#8221; trigclass=&#8221;expandTitle&#8221;]
<strong>What&#8217;s the best aspect about this product?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Gives a similar feeling of slate stones without the hefty price tag.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What is the weakest aspect of this product?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Though this is to be expected of someone who started out using yunzi stones, I found them to be a little slippery at first. However, it didn&#8217;t take long before I acclimated to the stones and had no trouble using them.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Is it durable?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Based on my usage so far, I see no reason why they wouldn&#8217;t last a lifetime if used properly. Doesn&#8217;t seem like it would chip easily.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Bottom Line</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Easy to clean and a pleasure to use.</li>
<li>If you like stones that are glossy and shine in the light, this is a great set for you.</li>
<li>For those who are not yet able to afford a set of slate and shell stones, this is a great set that gives a similar feel (i.e., smooth) and look (i.e., glossiness) without the hefty price tag.</li>
</ol>

[expand title=&#8221;My Review&#8221; trigclass=&#8221;expandTitle&#8221; expanded=&#8221;true&#8221;]
In my go collection, I&#8217;ve owned my fair share of different types of stones: yunzi, slate and shell, and plastic. The funny thing is that glass stones have always been relatively inexpensive to some of the stones I have bought; but no longer, that ends with this set!<br />

<span style="line-height: 1.5em;">As someone who started out using yunzi stones, I was a bit surprised at how slippery it was when I first started using it. Stones would slip out of my fingers constantly. However, after a bit of patience and realizing I couldn&#8217;t grip them with the same force I normally gripped yunzi stones, it came a lot easier and they did not fall out nearly as often.</span><span style="line-height: 1.5em;"><br />
</span><br />
At the end of the day, this is a beautiful set that any player would be delighted to have if they are looking for stones with a glossy finish that shine in the light. Highly recommended and as always, let me know if you have any questions about the set!<br />
