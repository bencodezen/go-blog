[expand title=&#8221;Before I Read This Book&#8230;&#8221; trigclass=&#8221;expandTitle&#8221;]
<strong>My Abilities</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>While I have done some studying on handicap go, my knowledge is primarily a compilation of advice from other people along with my own experience as well. Overall, I would say that I believe I have a basic understanding of how handicap games should be played.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>My Perspective</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Though I&#8217;ve read tidbits on handicap go here and there, I am hoping that this book will be the first that tries to break down handicap go into into simplest components in order to provide guidance to players new to handicap go.</li>
</ul>
[/expand]
[expand title=&#8221;My Review&#8221; trigclass=&#8221;expandTitle&#8221; expanded=&#8221;true&#8221;]
<strong>What did I enjoy about the book?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The advice for Black is broken down into 20 strategic principles.</li>
<li>There is a chapter devoted to advising how one should play with White.</li>
<li>There are example games that range from professionals level to amateur dan level.</li>
<li>There are practice problems to help reinforce the concepts the reader just learned.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What did I gain from reading this book?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A better understanding of how to play as Black in handicap games.</li>
<li>Realization that as White it is not actually beneficial to make overplays consistently, but rather to play solid moves with strategic value and to take advantage of Black&#8217;s inefficient moves and/or strategic plans.</li>
<li>A new perspective on how handicap games actually should go all the way into the endgame for the handicap to be considered fair in relation to the ranks.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What style of teaching does the book use?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Textbook Approach
<ul>
<li>Explanations can be very dense at times and it uses problems or examples to try and illustrate its message. This is not a negative thing though, since it allows for re-readability in the future.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Primary Learning Mechanism:
<ul>
<li>Explanations.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Other Learning Mechanisms:
<ul>
<li>Practice problems.</li>
<li>Examples from professional and amateur level games.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What aspect can be improved on?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>In the future, I think it would be nice to see strategic principles organized for White the way it is designed for Black. Not sure how possible this really is, but it&#8217;d be neat if it were possible.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Is this book easy to read?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Yes. Though some explanations may be advanced at times, Bozulich strikes a great balance between introductory explanations and advanced concepts. It makes for a solid book that will be worth re-reading in the future.</li>
</ul>
