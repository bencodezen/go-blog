[expand title=&#8221;Before I Read This Book&#8230;&#8221; trigclass=&#8221;expandTitle&#8221;]
As a mid to high SDK (i.e., single digit kyu) player, I was expecting to see the same quality of content from previous volumes. In addition, I was hoping that I would be able to solve most problems with relative ease while finding some problems challenging.<br />
[/expand]
[expand title=&#8221;My Review&#8221; trigclass=&#8221;expandTitle&#8221; expanded=&#8221;true&#8221;]
Once again, Lee Jae-Hwan has managed to sweep me off my feet when it comes to providing incredible content that really got my brain working. There were countless sections in here that I always knew about but really appreciated getting a chance to truly practice. Examples include: Identifying Seki, The Loose Connection, The Stone Pagoda, Hane Twice to Gain a Liberty, etc.<br />
Overall, I felt that the problems definitely started to increase in difficulty. While some problems are still very easy to solve and have very obvious solutions, there were numerous times where I had to really start looking at variations before concluding what my answer was going to be. I really appreciated this gradual increase in difficulty.<br />
Finally, some of you will notice that my &#8220;Things to Improve&#8221; section has become more of an Errata section (i.e., errors that I found). Although I still love the book and the series as a whole, there were a few more errors than I would have liked to have seen and some sections that weren&#8217;t as clear as they could have been (i.e., Cut On the Opposite Side).<br />
Nonetheless, this is still a wonderful addition to the series, and I&#8217;m looking forward to the next one!<br />
[/expand]
[expand title=&#8221;Synopsis&#8221; trigclass=&#8221;expandTitle&#8221;]
<strong>What did I enjoy about the book?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A very nice emphasis on evaluating seki positions.</li>
<li>Has the reader practice &#8220;fake nets.&#8221;</li>
<li>Does not hesitate to bring back basics like reading the ladder.</li>
<li>Really trains a lot of skills players often overlook like identifying vital points, hane twice to gain a liberty, and loose ladders.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What did I gain from reading this book?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>More comfortable with my ability to recognize seki positions.</li>
<li>Increased familiarity with various nets and reading out whether they work or not.</li>
<li>Increased confidence in reading out variations of basic life and death sequences.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What is the format of the book?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The book is primarily structured as follows:
<ul>
<li>(1) A one page explanation of the topic that you are about to practice. Example: When behind in liberties. They not only show the sequence for the proper technique, but also include common mistakes and brief explanations as to why they are mistakes.</li>
<li>(2) A set of very easy to understand and follow practice problems to ensure you understand what you are learning.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What aspect can be improved on?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Page 65 (#11) &#8211; Not a great example of bamboo vital point.</li>
<li>Page 66 (#5) &#8211; Answer is not the actual weakpoint. The 4-1 point is the weak point.</li>
<li>Page 69 (#4) &#8211; No solution available. Answer is the 4-1 point.</li>
<li>Page 94 Solutions &#8211; Label misprint. Skipped #10.</li>
<li>Page 122 (#12), Page 123 (#18), and Page 128 (#18) are identical problems.</li>
<li>Page 127 (#12) &#8211; In the wrong section. Different problem than expected. A save black problem in a kill white section.</li>
<li>Page 128 (#18) &#8211; In the wrong section. A kill white problem in a Save black section.</li>
<li>Page 143 (#22) &#8211; Again. Seems out of place. Problem&#8217;s solution is to maximize Black&#8217;s profit and not reduce White&#8217;s.</li>
<li>Page 148 (#3 Solution) &#8211; Wrong diagram. The answer should be the solid connection at 4-2 point. The tiger&#8217;s mouth at 4-1 works as well but leaves a ko threat of an atari at 3-2 and is therefore inferior to the solid connection.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Is this book easy to read?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Yes. Other than a few odd grammatical structures, it doesn&#8217;t get much more simple or straightforward than this.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Bottom Line</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Continues to live up to the quality of content you come to expect from this series.</li>
<li>Completely worth your time and money!</li>
</ol>

[expand title=&#8221;Before I Read This Book&#8230;&#8221; trigclass=&#8221;expandTitle&#8221;]
Around this time, my reading skills and knowledge was around 4-5 kyu. I have had a lot of success with this series up to this point, so I was looking forward to what skills I would be training next.<br />
[/expand]
[expand title=&#8221;My Review&#8221; trigclass=&#8221;expandTitle&#8221; expanded=&#8221;true&#8221;]
In this volume of the Jump Level Up Series, you will find the usual sample openings and introduction of a couple joseki along with a heavy emphasis on training techniques in capture stones. Whether this is through eye space reduction, shortage of liberties, or ways to get ahead in capturing races, there is certainly a lot to be learned and trained in this book. Other sections that may be of interest to others include finding effective connections along with an introduction of some endgame techniques as well. There is a section on ko in here as well, but it is not very robust and one should not expect too much from it. Overall however, the book has continued to live up to my expectations for this series and I would highly recommend it!<br />
[/expand]
[expand title=&#8221;Synopsis&#8221; trigclass=&#8221;expandTitle&#8221;]
<strong>What did I enjoy about the book?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Lots of training on capturing techniques.</li>
<li>It forces you to really get comfortable with capturing races.</li>
<li>Continues to provide the format and quality of content you come to expect from the series.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What did I gain from reading this book?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Improved ability to identify ways to get ahead in capturing races.</li>
<li>Some new endgame techniques that I have started to look for in my actual games.</li>
<li>Improved overall reading ability.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What is the format of the book?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The book is primarily structured as follows: (1) A one page explanation of the topic that you are about to practice. Example: When behind in liberties. They not only show the sequence for the proper technique, but also include common mistakes and brief explanations as to why they are mistakes. (2) A set of very easy to understand and follow practice problems to ensure you understand what you are learning.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What aspect can be improved on?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>On two occasions, a problem that is beyond the scope of what I was practicing popped up. Problems #23 and #24 on Page 151. This was rather left-field and threw me off quite a bit. I would recommend against these sort of problems since it can be discouraging to those without an answer book.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Is this book easy to read?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Yes. It doesn&#8217;t get much more simple or straightforward than this.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Bottom Line</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Continues to live to the high expectations I have for this series.</li>
<li>An incredible way for players to immerse themselves and gain the ability to actually apply the concepts they are learning to their own games.</li>
<li>Worth the money!</li>

<li>My reading skills and knowledge would probably equate to a solid 5 kyu at this point.</li>

<li>Improved fundamentals in endgame techniques.</li>
<li>More familiarity with haengma (e.g., stone movement) regarding diving, blockading, and connections.</li>
<li>Reinforcement on my semeai (e.g., capturing races) skills.</li>
<li>Reinforcement of my understanding of tesuji such as jachung (e.g., shortage of liberties) and clamps.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What is the format of the book?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The book is primarily structured as follows: (1) A one page explanation of the topic that you are about to practice. Example: When behind in liberties. They not only show the sequence for the proper technique, but also include common mistakes and brief explanations as to why they are mistakes. (2) A set of very easy to understand and follow practice problems to ensure you understand what you are learning.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What aspect can be improved on?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>When learning about endgame techniques, there were a couple of problems where I had to figure it out for myself when solving it. In other words, there was no prior explanation that focused on that specific techniques (e.g., snapback). To be clear though, this occurred like in 1% of the problems, so it&#8217;s not a big issue at all; but it&#8217;s something I thought I would note.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Is this book easy to read?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Yes. It doesn&#8217;t get much more simple or straightforward than this.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Bottom Line</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Continues to live to the high expectations I have for this series.</li>
<li>An incredible way for players to immerse themselves and gain the ability to actually apply the concepts they are learning to their own games.</li>
<li>Worth every penny!</li>
</ol>

[expand title=&#8221;My Review&#8221; trigclass=&#8221;expandTitle&#8221; expanded=&#8221;true&#8221;]
When I first heard that there was an intermediate level of the Level Up Series, you can only imagine how ecstatic I was. And though part of me thought that it would suddenly be a lot more advanced, I am really pleased with how the transition is actually hardly noticeable.<br />
As usual with this series, I really love how I am just forced to practice concepts to the point where I am quite sick of it. The reason for this is that when you first learn a concept, it takes a bit of efforts in order to apply the concept. However, with their study method, I am now incredibly more comfortable at spotting out things such as jachung (e.g., shortage of liberties).<br />
And another thing I&#8217;ll note with about the Jump Level Up series, they still take no chances in letting fundamental skills such as falsifying eyes get even the slightest bit rusty. Though it might seem like you are repeating something &#8220;so simple,&#8221; I really appreciate that they do this since I still found myself answering some of the problems incorrectly (which clearly goes to show that my foundational skills are not quite flawless yet).<br />

<ol>
<li>A very thorough review of the last five volumes of Level Up.</li>
<li>The game samples are starting to be rather complicated.</li>
<li>Continues to live up to the quality of problems and content you come to expect of the series.</li>
</ol>

[expand title=&#8221;Before I Read This Book&#8230;&#8221; trigclass=&#8221;expandTitle&#8221;]
<strong>My Abilities</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A mid to high SDK (single digit kyu) kyu who has read his fair share of go books and has a pretty strong foundation in the basics and teaching go.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>My Perspective</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Towards the end of the series, I noticed that I am actually starting to make mistakes here and there. So I&#8217;m going to try and take this a little slower in hopes of not making any mistakes.</li>
</ul>
[/expand]
[expand title=&#8221;My Review&#8221; trigclass=&#8221;expandTitle&#8221; expanded=&#8221;true&#8221;]
<strong>What did I enjoy about the book?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Spends quite a bit of time talking about go etiquette and one&#8217;s mindset/attitude when playing go.</li>
<li>Extremely thoroughly reviews the material you learned from Level Up 5 &#8211; 10.</li>
<li>The Next Moves problems also took a step up in difficult and complication. In fact, there were quite a few times where I was a little lost as to which was the correct answer.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What did I gain from reading this book?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Further realization of how, even at the what they consider DDK level, there are still holes in my reading abilities.</li>
<li>Reinforced understanding of the josekis that they have taught thus far.</li>
<li>Polished reading ability and improved analysis speed.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What style of teaching does the book use?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Curriculum Style
<ul>
<li>Content is organized into lessons, topics, or themes in order to facilitate learning.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Primary Learning Mechanism:
<ul>
<li>Practice problems</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Other Learning Mechanisms:
<ul>
<li>Cute and entertaining comics to teach and/or reinforce lessons.</li>
<li>Simple explantations that are accompanied by equally simple diagrams.</li>
<li>Samples of openings from professional games to further acclimate the reader to full games on a 19&#215;19 board.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What aspect can be improved on?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Page 55 #10 Solution is incorrect.</li>
<li>I enjoy the Next Move problems, but the lack of explanations for why certain moves are the correct answer leaves me a little unsettled. Don&#8217;t forget that this considers the fact that I have more knowledge than someone learning these things for the first time. So explanations for why a certain move (e.g., capping move) is correct would be very helpful.</li>
<li>The calculating endgame move value problems were actually rather difficult. I don&#8217;t feel like the previous volumes prepared me enough for these questions.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Is this book easy to read?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Yes. Other than the occasional article, the explanations are very easy short and easy to understand.</li>

</ul>
<p><strong>My Perspective</strong></p>
<ul>

[expand title=&#8221;My Review&#8221; trigclass=&#8221;expandTitle&#8221; expanded=&#8221;true&#8221;]
<strong>What did I enjoy about the book?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>I like how they correct basic misconceptions (that are rampant even in SDK games I&#8217;ve watched) like trying to block on the second line by hane early in the game.</li>
<li>I really like they show possible mistakes in joseki and teaches the reader how to handle them.</li>
<li>Introduces the reader to different techniques in winning capturing races.</li>
<li>Already starts to get the player to start being wary of trick plays, albeit not vey complicated ones.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What did I gain from reading this book?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A better understanding of the reason behind certain moves in joseki.</li>
<li>Firmer grasp of fundamental principles behind haengma (i.e. movement of the stones).</li>
<li>Greater comfort with capturing races and some of the techniques behind winning them.</li>

<li>I really like the fact that they devote time to training the reader to recognize key stones.</li>
<li>I also really liked the fact that they subtly show proper use of the &#8220;empty triangle.&#8221;</li>
<li>Once again, they do a great job with life and death by training even the most basic skills like &#8220;Making a Living 4-Point Eye Shape.&#8221; It might seem easy, but unless it&#8217;s second nature, players might actually miss it in their actual games.</li>
<li>They really try and break down the flow of moves for you. For example, the different types of blocking.</li>
<li>They start teaching how to punish overplay cuts and whether or not you should cut! *mind blown*</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What did I gain from reading this book?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Continued polishing of my reading abilities.</li>

<strong>My Abilities</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A mid to high SDK (single digit kyu) kyu who has read his fair share of go books and has a pretty strong foundation in the basics and teaching go.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>My Perspective</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>I was able to progress through Level Up 4 pretty easily, so I was hoping that this would be pretty straightforward as well.</li>
</ul>

[expand title=&#8221;My Review&#8221; trigclass=&#8221;expandTitle&#8221; expanded=&#8221;true&#8221;]
<strong>What did I enjoy about the book?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>It introduces the reader to the concept of good and bad shapes.</li>
<li>Starts training the reader to practice looking for important stones.</li>
<li>They do a great job introducing seki and offer lots of really simple but effective practice problems for it.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What did I gain from reading this book?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Polished my ability to distinguish between key stones in capturing races.</li>
<li>Started rebuilding my ability to see seki positions from the ground up.</li>
<li>Polished my abilities to use nets, shortage of liberties, ladders, and snapback.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What style of teaching does the book use?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Curriculum Style
<ul>
<li>Content is organized into lessons, topics, or themes in order to facilitate learning.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Primary Learning Mechanism:
<ul>
<li>Practice problems</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Other Learning Mechanisms:
<ul>
<li>Cute and entertaining comics to teach and/or reinforce lessons.</li>
<li>Simple explantations that are accompanied by equally simple diagrams.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What aspect(s) can be improved on?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>No complaints here. I was really happy with the progression of problems in this book.</li>
<li>Errata &#8211; Question #3 on page 51 &#8211; Black&#8217;s shape seems incorrect. The stones should form a solid triangle instead of the hanging connection.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Is this book easy to read?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Yes. It was very easy to understand all the explanations and progress through the book.</li>
</ul>
[/expand]
[expand title=&#8221;Recommended For&#8230;&#8221; trigclass=&#8221;expandTitle&#8221;]

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2><strong>Overview</strong></h2>
<p>As many of you probably noticed, I have been pretty consumed with studying go and releasing book reviews as fast as I can. My progress with the Level Up series has been great! I&#8217;ve been averaging about 1.5 days for each volume. Not as fast as I wish I was, but not bad in the scheme of things. It&#8217;s been really great to see what kids in Korea have been learning and realizing how unstable my fundamentals were in comparison. I&#8217;m hoping that I will be finished with the Level Up series by next week so that I can find out what&#8217;s in store for me in the Jump Level Up series.<br />
Also, many thanks to Malcolm for setting me on the path to finally working out the kinks in the email subscriptions. As some of you might have noticed, email newsletters are going to be looking a lot different! The design is far from finished, but I wanted to at least release the initial version of the email layout so that you wouldn&#8217;t have to deal with the horrendous layout that Jetpack was sending at one point. Hope it makes for a better reading experience!<br />
<strong>**Update:</strong> It seems that Jetpack was still turned on this morning so the email newsletter might have been sent twice. Sorry to anyone on the subscriber list! I am working to iron out all the kinks with the new email subscription plugin.</p>
