<p>So people have said my games were violent&#8230; Well a few weeks ago I finally decided to hop on IGS and check it out. I ended up losing the first couple automatches due to some rather epic blunders, but then I played this game.<br />
What I will say about it is that if you thought my previous games were bloody.. well&#8230; I just don&#8217;t know how to describe this game other than it&#8217;s was the biggest massacre I&#8217;ve ever done with someone around my strength.<br />
My opponent certainly ignores me at some critical points, so I end up getting away with what was most definitely overplays, but I thought you find the game entertaining, so here it is!<br />

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 style="text-align: center;">Introduction</h2>
<p>For this week&#8217;s meditation, I am featuring another bloody game from my kadoban with my friend Nate (who&#8217;s been featured on here numerous times). There are a few things to take away from this game:</p>
<ol>
<li>Just because you&#8217;re ahead does not give you a reason to be cocky.</li>
<li>Even when you think you think you&#8217;ve taken everything away from a group, they are still really hard to kill.</li>
<li>Connecting your groups takes priority over attacking.</li>
<li>Finally, even though you would think this is self-explanatory, ALWAYS READ.</li>
</ol>
<p>The entire game would have been very different if I had just taken 30 seconds to read. Sigh. But nonetheless, it should be a fun game for you all to witness as bloodshed is featured once again on Monday Go Meditation (MGM). (Maybe I should start putting rating on my games like: PG-13 or rated R? Haha.) Hope you enjoy the review and another big thanks to Nate for letting me use our games on MGM.<br />

<h2 style="text-align: center;"><strong>One Point Lesson</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: center;">Once you&#8217;ve established a lead, focus on repairing any weaknesses you have so that your opponent cannot stage a comeback.</p>

<p>For this week&#8217;s meditation, I will start by prefacing the fact that before I started playing this game, I noticed my opponent was German. Based on my experience thus far, there are three groups of players that have been consistently aggressive and challenged my reading abilities constantly: Russians, Koreans, and Germans. This is by no means a bad thing, but it certainly made me a tad nervous. And just as I guessed, I ended up with another bloody game on my hands. It&#8217;s starting to make me think there is a trend in my games&#8230; Enjoy!<br />

<h2 style="text-align: center;"><strong>One Point Lesson</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: center;">Always choose profit over the very difficult task of killing a group. Then if your opponent decides to neglect his group and the conditions are ripe, then it&#8217;s time to pounce.</p>

<p>For this week&#8217;s go meditation, there are only two words that would aptly describe the violence in this game: bloodshed everywhere&#8230; Although this may look odd since my opponent is 2k and I&#8217;m 4k, this is around the time I got promoted to 3k on KGS. So in reality it&#8217;s a one stone difference between us and the fact is that we have had a long standing history of having violent games. Be sure to grab your popcorn as you watch the violence unfold on the board. Enjoy.<br />

<h2 style="text-align: center;"><strong>One Point Lesson</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: center;">When preparing to engage in the bloodiest battle of your life, the most important thing to do is keep track of how strong all of your groups in relation to the epic fight.</p>
