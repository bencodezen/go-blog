				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 id="introduction" style="text-align: center;">Introduction</h2>
<p>Contrary to what I said last week, this week’s Monday Go Meditation features my Yunguseng Dojang game from last week. The reason for this is two-fold: (1) I didn’t play any other games over the past two weeks and (2) I’m still trying to keep MGM as current as possible.<br />
As I mentioned before, I was feeling rather iffy before this game. My opponent was around 4–5k in strenghth, and with my ups and downs lately, I wasn’t so sure that I could even beat him. But before I could wallow too much in my own insecurities, the game started.<br />
<em>Note: Similar to the other YSD match I posted last week, any specific things I learned from the review will be omitted in this game to respect other members’ paid membership.</em><br />

<h2 id="onepointlesson" style="text-align: center;"><strong>One Point Lesson</strong></h2>
<p>When playing a moyo vs moyo game, don’t get caught up in small gains (like taking a corner) when big points like an opponent’s corner enclosure on a double winged formation are available on the board.<br />

no,Category,Good,Bad<br />
1,Opening,<strong>Move 10</strong> &#8211; This is not so much a good move as it is a move I’m proud of because it showed kiai on my part to be willing to compete with Black on a moyo game.,&#8221;<strong>Move 18</strong> &#8211; Though this moved seemed nice at the time, it was not very effective in terms of the whole board.&#8221;<br />
2,Attack and Defense,<strong>Move 44</strong> &#8211; The fact that I was able to take a step back to defend my group first before overextending my attack was a sign of progress for me.,<strong>Move 72</strong> &#8211; Trying to invade to attack the Black group was a bad attack.<br />
3,Shape,<strong>Move 162</strong> &#8211; Recognizing this clamp instantly was a nice moment for me since it meant I was increasing my repertoire of techniques to use.,<strong>Move 108</strong> &#8211; This doesn’t really defend my corner and makes bad shape.<br />
4,Strategy,<strong>Move 148</strong> &#8211; Sacrificing my four stones to push and cut here is one of the key moves that allowed me to secure my win.,<strong>Move 62</strong> &#8211; This peep and following sequence to take the corner was too small strategically.<br />
5,Overall Reading,<strong>Move 208</strong> &#8211; Reading out Black’s subsequent atari and seeing how it played out was a pretty big moment for me even though I missed the killing move at the end.,<strong>Move 82</strong> &#8211; The following sequence was just awful for me. Complete misread.<br />
6,Endgame,&#8221;<strong>Move 120</strong> &#8211; Though this move was an overplay, the idea of taking sente instead of responding to Black was good.&#8221;,<strong>Move 86</strong> &#8211; Blocking here instead of defending my bottom group nearly allowed my opponent to reverse the game in his favor.<br />
