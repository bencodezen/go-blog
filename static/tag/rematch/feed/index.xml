				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This will be my only game for today. It was played pretty poorly in my opinion. That&#8217;s what I get for playing first thing in the morning I guess. The fun part is that I got to play an opponent that I had played before on my zenix account. At the time, he was 16k and I was 19k, and I managed to win by 30 points! Needless to say, I was excited at the prospect of being able to play with him again on equal grounds!<br />

This game was interesting because it&#8217;s the first time my opponent chose the opposing corners for the opening. Granted, I&#8217;m not strong enough to really understand the implications of such a game, but it certainly surprised me. Compared to last time though, not such a big win. My opponent made some careless errors, and I happened to read out a couple things better than him that allowed me to win the game. Otherwise though, I really think I played awfully.<br />
Check out the game record below and let me know your thoughts!<br />

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One of the fun things about getting to play go on the internet is the fact that you have a lot of opponents to play with. While that is great in a lot of aspects, I used to always get the itch to rematch with opponents so that I could see if I got any better. Call it a grudge if you will, but for me it&#8217;s usually more of a curiosity than anything else.<br />
Lo and behold, I was granted the opportunity to play against an opponent that I had previously lost to before. When I last played this guy, I lost practically every single fight that I got into. So in hindsight, I think I just wanted to reclaim some of my honor and dignity. =)<br />

As you can see in the game record, I managed to make it out alive with a ~30 point win! Woot woot! Elated feeling for the day: check! Can&#8217;t let this get to my head too much though, got to keep getting stronger!</p>
