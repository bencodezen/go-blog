				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>This week seems to have been dwindling down in terms of playing. Part of it is due to the fact that I know that I&#8217;ve been in more aggressive mood lately (which usually leads to me going on tilt), but I think the other part is that I am getting in a study groove again. I&#8217;ve gotten an urge to try and read as many books as I can possibly can before needing to burning out from studying, by which of course then it&#8217;ll be time to play more games again. On top of that, I&#8217;m also trying to really create a robust <a title="Books" href="//reviews/books/">Book Review</a> section for this blog so that players can really get a sense of what they&#8217;re buying when selecting a book.</p>
<h2>Games</h2>
<ul>
<li><span style="line-height: 13px;">KGS &#8211; 1 game (0 wins : 1 loss)</span></li>
<li>DGS &#8211; 1 ongoing game</li>
<li>Nova &#8211; 1 ongoing game</li>
</ul>
<h2>Training</h2>
<ul>
<li><span style="line-height: 13px;">Started the <em>Essential Life &amp; Death</em> series again.</span></li>
<li>Finished the theory section and some problems in <em>Mastering the Basics: Ko.</em></li>
<li>Finished my first reading of <em>Kage&#8217;s Secret Chronicles of Handicap Go.</em></li>
<li>Started reading <em>The Chinese Opening</em> by Yuan Zhou.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Lessons Learned</h2>
<ol>
<li>If I can&#8217;t give 100% of my attention to a game of go, I should refrain from playing with strangers.</li>
<li>I need to re-discipline my reading abilities so that I feel certain about what might happen instead of playing a move because it &#8220;looks like it&#8217;ll work.&#8221;</li>
</ol>
