				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A couple days ago, I was doing some mitt work with my partner at the local boxing gym. About halfway into the round, I was getting visibly tired and close to exhaustion from trying to push beyond my limits. It was then though, that my partner said something that struck me:</p>
<blockquote><p>Remember to breathe. Control your breathing.</p></blockquote>
<p>Seems like such an obvious statement no? After all, don&#8217;t we all breathe subconsciously? Without breathing, we&#8217;d all be dead! What a stupid thing to say!<br />
If you think such crude and rudimentary thoughts though, you are missing the point. The fact is that while I might have been &#8220;breathing,&#8221; the fact is that I was so caught up in punching and keeping good form that I forgot to breathe half the time. You might exclaim, &#8220;How does one forget to breathe Ben? That&#8217;s ridiculous!&#8221; And you&#8217;re right to some extent, but instead of breathing more efficiently through my nose and exhaling through my mouth, I was holding my breath half the time (without even realizing it due to concentrating so hard on punching and maintaing form) and taking short gasps of air with my mouth in between. It&#8217;s no wonder that I was winded and at the point of near collapse before the round was even halfway through.<br />
So how does this relate to go?<br />
The reason I went to great lengths to explain breathing in boxing is because it occurred to me that a similar thing was happening to kyu players. Instead of breathing however, I would make the analogy that kyu players often players fail to play moves with the whole board in mind. Similar to breathing, it is a given that every move that is played affects the board in some way shape or form. However, if we just play moves without making a conscious effort to understand or give it a purpose in regard to the entire board, it is just as if we are going through the motions of punching without remembering to breathe properly. And then the next thing you know, you&#8217;re out of breath and your opponent cuts off a big group and delivers the knockout punch.<br />
Of course with time and experience, playing moves with respect to the entire board will be second nature; but while we still remain the weak kyu players that we are, we must be sure to make a conscious effort to take the entire board into consideration at all times. So to put my partner&#8217;s advice into another context:</p>
<blockquote><p>Remember to consider the board as a whole before playing your next move.</p></blockquote>

<strong>My Abilities</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>I&#8217;ve read a fair share of books and feel decently knowledgeable about the basic tactics and strategy of the game.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>My Perspective</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>As a kyu player, I am still trying to figure out what&#8217;s wrong with my play so that I can traverse into the dan levels. So I&#8217;m hoping this book will shed some light on that.</li>
</ul>
[/expand]
[expand title=&#8221;My Review&#8221; trigclass=&#8221;expandTitle&#8221; expanded=&#8221;true&#8221;]
The first chapter, which explains the misconceptions players have when playing go, is not particularly long; but the information is absolutely critical. The beauty of it all is that it&#8217;s delivered in an extremely concise manner. No wading through a ton of terms just to understand what 1+1 is.<br />
In addition, while incorporating principles of play into his analysis, a second aspect that I absolutely love in these chapters is the fact that we get to find out why the players played the way they did. (I don&#8217;t know about you, but that really helps to make me feel less alienated since I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Hey! I&#8217;ve thought that too before!&#8221;) Once you are given the player&#8217;s reasoning (e.g. Black felt that white&#8217;s area was too big), Zhou gives immediate explanation for why it is faulty. SCORE!<br />
I also have to admit that it is actually more advanced that I thought when I first bought it. I&#8217;m not sure whether it&#8217;s just me, but I have always found example games to be rather hard to learn from since the reviews tend to require a well rounded understanding of all go basics in order for the game review to make much sense. As a result, the only real critique I have for the book is that it should be revised to be more robust with practice problems (or multiple choice questions) to further help reinforce the principles that so many kyu players violate.<br />
Overall though, I would still have to say that Zhou does a great job trying to provide some guidance for kyu players on habits that most players fail to realize are holding them back. I can definitely say that I still fall victim to some of the things that Zhou talks about. Definitely worth purchasing if you&#8217;re a kyu player and feel stuck no matter how many new tactics and tesujis you learn.<br />

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 style="text-align: center;">Weekly Go Wednesday, Issue #18</h2>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2013/02/gobanwhiteflag.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2120" alt="gobanwhiteflag" src="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2013/02/gobanwhiteflag.jpg?resize=300%2C300" width="300" height="300" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>As most of us are aware, the game of go is rather unique in the sense that it is considered honorable to resign. Unfortunately, when it comes to kyu players (particularly mid-SDK&#8217;s and below), I have found that resignation is the bane of their existence. Instead of resignation being a quiet acknowledgment of their opponent&#8217;s strength, it becomes a self-imposed obstacle that prevents kyu players from getting stronger. If you don&#8217;t believe me, read on.<br />
<span id="more-1904"></span><br />
I&#8217;ve watched my fair share of games, and more often than not, all it takes to get kyu players to resign is the capture of a decent sized group. Granted, the loss of a group can be difficult to swallow for kyu players, but this is by no means a reason to give up on the game as a whole. After all, just because you lost one battle doesn&#8217;t mean you lost the war. As if that wasn&#8217;t enough, the resignations tend to occur in the early to middle game stages. Have players forgotten that endgame can make a huge difference in terms of who wins the game?<br />
While this is by no means an absolute guideline for when to resign as a kyu player, there are only three reasons when a player should resign in casual games:</p>
<ol>
<li><span style="line-height: 13px;"><strong>You&#8217;re just plodding along hoping for some monumentally huge error on your opponent&#8217;s part.</strong> If you&#8217;re doing this, it&#8217;s time to resign, take a break, and come back with a renewed spirit for your next game. </span></li>
<li><strong>Your group which took up half the board died.</strong> In this case, obviously the battle became the war. So no point wasting any more time.</li>
<li><strong>You can legitimately count and you know that you can&#8217;t catch up.</strong> Although if you can and have the patience to do this, you probably don&#8217;t have this tendency anyways.</li>
</ol>
<p>Otherwise, it is critical to remember that there is a lot to be said about seeing a game through to the end. Just because you feel behind doesn&#8217;t mean it&#8217;s time to go running to the resign button. In fact, one of the greatest accomplishments a player can have is being able to reverse a game to his/her favor. After all, who doesn&#8217;t love a good underdog story?<br />
So the next time you are thinking about resigning when things are looking bad, remember the following:</p>
<ol>
<li><span style="line-height: 13px;"><strong>These are the best opportunities to learn how to come back from behind</strong>. Even if you can&#8217;t reverse the game entirely, being able to close the gap is a critical skill that will become a dangerous weapon in your arsenal in your future. After all, if all your games are won or loss through resignation, when do you ever plan on practicing your endgame?</span></li>
<li><strong>It will become a terrible habit that will cause you to start resigning games where you are actually ahead.</strong> That&#8217;s right. You heard me. That habit of running off with your tail in between your legs just because you feel frustrated or badly is only going to cause unnecessary resignations in the future. So don&#8217;t do it. Just stop.</li>
<li><b>You start to get used to winning or losing by resignation. </b>This is especially bad for people who plan on playing in tournaments because I will tell you one thing for sure, people will go down fighting tooth and nail in tournaments. Being able to &#8220;win a won game&#8221; or &#8220;turning the tables&#8221; becomes critical in every game that you will play. And since you can&#8217;t control your opponents, the least you can do is reduce the frequency of you resigning your own games.</li>
</ol>
<p>Never forget that it is better to lose by a lot than never having fought at all. Do not cave in and resign easily, fight on till there is nothing left!</p>
