[expand title=&#8221;Synopsis&#8221; trigclass=&#8221;expandTitle&#8221; expanded=&#8221;true&#8221;]
<ol>
<li>A great overview on a lot of different shapes that players can definitely benefit from.</li>
<li>Not a good introductory book for life and death.</li>
<li>Requires a higher reading ability level for the practice problems than I was anticipating.</li>
</ol>
[/expand]
[expand title=&#8221;Before I Read This Book&#8230;&#8221; trigclass=&#8221;expandTitle&#8221;]
<strong>My Abilities</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Having worked through other life and death books, I am confident enough to say that I have a SDK (single digit kyu) understanding of life and death.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>My Perspective</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>I was looking forward to getting exposed to a lot of basic life and death shapes. In addition, I was hoping to get a bit of practice on the different shapes so I could be a lot more confident on my life and death abilities when I finished the book.</li>
</ul>
[/expand]
[expand title=&#8221;My Review&#8221; trigclass=&#8221;expandTitle&#8221; expanded=&#8221;true&#8221;]
<strong>What did I enjoy about the book?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>There are so many shapes that you get to learn about!</li>
<li>On top of that, these shapes are ones that actually occur quite frequently in games! Case and point, I actually ran into a J shape soon after I finished the book.</li>
<li>There are a lot of &#8220;what is the status of this group&#8221; problems.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What did I gain from reading this book?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Exposure to a lot of new shapes that I never even considered life and death shapes in the past.</li>
<li>Better understanding of the weaknesses in various shapes.</li>
<li>New ideas regarding how the opponent would/should actually respond in certain life and death scenarios.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What style of teaching does the book use?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Textbook Approach
<ul>
<li>Organized in a curriculum format that reflects the learning style one might normally find in school.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Primary Learning Mechanism:
<ul>
<li>Explanations with example diagrams</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Other Learning Mechanisms:
<ul>
<li>Practice problems</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What aspect can be improved on?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Though the fact that it uses &#8220;what is the status of this group&#8221; problems is a good thing for the most part, I feel that this is counter-productive to anyone learning life and death for the first time since status problems can actually be rather difficult for players who are not accustomed to reading multiple rather complex variations in life and death situations.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Is this book easy to read?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Yes. Davies&#8217; writing style is easy to understand and his conversational style makes for a fun read. In addition, almost every diagram is accompanied by a short line or paragraph explaining the position.</li>
</ul>

[expand title=&#8221;In Comparison to Similar Books&#8230;&#8221; trigclass=&#8221;expandTitle&#8221;]
[expandsub1 title=&#8221;1001 Life and Death Problems&#8221; trigclass=&#8221;cBookTitle&#8221;]
<a title="Book Review: 1001 Life and Death Problems" href="//book-review-1001-life-and-death-problems/">1001 Life and Death Problems</a> is much more appropriate for players looking for an introduction to life and go. It does a great job providing the building blocks for being able to see the variations that are found in Davies&#8217; Life and Death.<br />
[/expandsub1]
[expandsub2 title=&#8221;Essential Life &amp; Death Series&#8221; trigclass=&#8221;cBookTitle&#8221;]
The Essential Life &amp; Death Series takes a more gradual approach with life and death and provides the reader with ample opportunities to practice. However, it does not contain the explanations that you get with Davies&#8217; Life and Death, so they complement one another very well.<br />
[/expandsub2]
[/expand]
[expand title=&#8221;Recommended For&#8230;&#8221; trigclass=&#8221;expandTitle&#8221;]
<ul>
<li>Players looking for a reference on numerous shapes that are frequently encountered in games.</li>
<li>Players who have read other life and death books and are looking to expand their knowledge and test their skills.</li>
</ul>
