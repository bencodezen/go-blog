				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I mentioned recently that I wanted to turn my attention Tygem because of how different the players are there. I tried explaining it to a friend a night or two ago but couldn&#8217;t find the right game to really illustrate it.<br />
Well, after talking with frozensoul today, I thought I&#8217;d fire up one of my old dan level accounts on Tygem and take a stab at playing on it again.<br />
Oy vey&#8230; the epitome of aggressiveness occurred tonight. Invade&#8230; fight&#8230;. invade&#8230; attach&#8230; die&#8230;. invade&#8230; fight&#8230; ahhhh&#8230;&#8230;<br />
I think I&#8217;ve lost like 5+ games in a row now. While I feel like I&#8217;m on a bit of an emotional tilt from getting pulverized game after game, I think it&#8217;s good medicine to offset my victory at the <a title="1st Washington Open Baduk Championship — Part II" href="//1st-washington-open-baduk-championship-part-ii/">Washington Baduk Open Championship</a>.<br />
Perhaps it&#8217;s the fact that I haven&#8217;t played much, or maybe it&#8217;s just that I&#8217;m really weak against Korean players. In fact, as I think back to the games I lost, I think the bottom line is that they were able to outfight me and play much sharper moves each time (which ended up killing me constantly). I tried to swing by with all my might, but it was like I was poking them with a sewing needle and then came down on me with a two handed axe.<br />
Ah well. They say to lose your first 100 games when you start playing right? Looks like I&#8217;ll be starting that exercise up again as I dive back into the war zone. *deep breath* See you on the other side.</p>
