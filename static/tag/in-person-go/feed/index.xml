				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So yesterday wasn&#8217;t as eventful as I&#8217;d like, I got to play Keith in a full on handicap game and that was fun&#8230;. but then I had to leave early so no more Go that night&#8230; I also forgot to bring my Kifu book from YMImports so bummer that.<br />
Today was interesting though.  I got to play one timed game (regular and speed) with Todd.  Definitely have a long way to go&#8230; And then I got to play two more games that were quite challenging.  I made some careless errors and reads that cost me the game, but I think I&#8217;ve learned a lot from it.  I&#8217;m still too unfamiliar with what to do and how to read things&#8230; so more studying to do.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So I visited the Greater Washington Go Club today.  Man&#8230; it was definitely a different experience playing with people in person.  I met a lot of great people, and my cousin and I learned a whole ton through their helpful comments and lessons.  We spent a lot of time playing out various positions based on the 3-3 point invasion on the 4-4 star, and that was super helpful.<br />
In addition to having a couple games commented on, I also experienced my first full game between two dan level players.  That was awesome.  And it reminds me of how much work I have to do before I can even be considered an average player.  So it&#8217;s time I get back to my studies.<br />
Shout outs go out to Hal, Betsy, and Justin for helping out.  I&#8217;m sorry but I&#8217;m totally blanking out on three other names, but thanks for making the experience an awesome one.</p>
