				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As most of you know, I&#8217;ve spent my fair share of money on this game. Perhaps one of my craziest purchases as a beginner was <a title="Amazon Purchase Link" href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/7500917260/?tag=mclambjavier999-20">The Complete Game Records of Go Seigen</a>. Yup. I bought it in <a title="BenGoZen September 2010 Archive" href="//2010/09/">September 2010</a> when I was a mere 15k.  And though it may have seemed like the biggest waste of money at the time, I can only smile as I think about how funny the world works sometimes.<br />
Since my first step onto the endless path of go, I have come to learn of many different professionals along with their various styles. And though I&#8217;ve come and gone between the various ones and learned from them, none of them ever really stuck with me. It&#8217;s not that I don&#8217;t admire their strength or am not a fan of them, but there was never one that stuck with me more than another.<br />
<span id="more-5391"></span><br />
For those who have read <a title="Book Review: First Kyu" href="//book-review-first-kyu/">First Kyu</a>, you might remember that Wook (the main character) studied endlessly from <em>Game Records of Wu</em>, which was the focal point of his study to become a professional. And as I was reading it again for like the fifth time, the following paragraph struck me.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;One day during his fifth month in the mountains, Wook suddenly experienced higher understanding. It was during his eight time reviewing the game records of Master Wu. The experience was the go equivalent of Buddha under the tree, or Jesus after forty days in the wilderness.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Wook came to find his go through studying Master Wu*, similar to how Hikaru&#8217;s go is entrenched in Shusaku&#8217;s (ultimately Sai&#8217;s) go. And after reading that again, part of me wondered who my Master Wu would be. And as the fates would have it, my mind shot straight to my collection of Go Seigen books sitting on my bookshelf at my parent&#8217;s place.<br />
I know that the more popular historical figures that most people study are legends like Honinbo Shusaku, <a title="Kitani Minoru Sensei's Library's Page" href="http://senseis.xmp.net/?KitaniMinoru">Kitani Minoru</a>&#8216;s disciples, Lee Changho, and Lee Sedol because their style is much easier to understand and imitate. And in all honesty, I have tried to study most of them, but I never felt that inspiration that many people talk about when going through a professional&#8217;s games.<br />
I&#8217;ve been told countless times that Go Seigen is very difficult to imitate and requires an immensely strong reading ability for his style to work. Yet, as I sat down with the first volume and my board and stones, a feeling of awe and inspiration came over me as I started playing out the moves on the board. And in that moment, I could feel it deep down: Go Seigen is my Master Wu.<br />
<em>*Fun Trivia: Apparently speculation is that Master Wu in <a title="Book Review: First Kyu" href="//book-review-first-kyu/">First Kyu</a> actually refers to Go Seigen. I had absolutely no idea. Isn&#8217;t that crazy?!</em></p>

<h3>Detailed Review</h3>
<p>I don&#8217;t know about you, but I always wondered what the lives of other go players are like. For example, what is life like in an Asian country where go is popular and someone, who is not an insei, decides to pursue the  goal of becoming a professional? After all, we all know that there is a test that everyone takes to become a professional, but what about the journey up to that point? There must be so much more than simply studying 24/7 and managing to pass the test. What about real life stuff?<br />
Fortunately for me and the entire go world, Dr. Sung-Hwa Hong did a brilliant job answering those questions and many more through his spellbinding story of a boy named Wook and his pursuit of becoming a professional go player.<br />
What makes this book so compelling is the fact that while the central plot is around go, Dr. Hong&#8217;s depiction of Wook&#8217;s everyday life and how it impacts his journey is just mind-blowing. As if that wasn&#8217;t enough to make it an excellent read, there are so many nuances about the Korean culture that you learn along the way that make it an even more enjoyable experience.<br />
An interesting trivia about this book is the fact that the book was actually originally written in Korean. As with most books that are written in other languages, a translator usually steps into the picture. However, Dr. Hong was concerned that a lot of the tenacity and aura of the book would be lost through a third person translator that he translated the whole thing himself (which is an impressive feat in my book). And to be honest, I&#8217;m glad he did, because I don&#8217;t think the book would&#8217;ve been nearly as awesome if he hadn&#8217;t done it himself.<br />
So if you&#8217;re still wondering how good this book is, this is an incredible book that could even serve as a catalyst for non-go players to take an interest in go. In fact, I might even go as far to say that this book could be the <a title="Hikaru no Go Wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hikaru_no_Go">Hikaru no Go</a> for adults who don&#8217;t like comics/anime. In fact, if there were ever a movie about go that could gain success with the masses, it would need to be based off this book. And finally, I finished the entire book in one sitting because I couldn&#8217;t stand the idea of stopping.<br />
That&#8217;s right. It&#8217;s that good.</p>
<h4>Table of Contents</h4>
<p><em>I&#8217;ve decided not to jot down the table of contents since it is a little revealing as to how the plot progresses. It&#8217;s better you just trust me and read it for yourself. </em></p>
<h4>Recommended Vendor:</h4>
<ol>
<li>Amazon &#8211; <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0964479699/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=be09a-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0964479699">$50.00</a>* (S&amp;H not included)</li>
</ol>
<p><em>*Amazon used to carry this book, but it seems that it&#8217;s rather difficult to locate now. So if anyone ever notices the price/availability of the book has changed or if you know of any other vendors, please let me know!</em></p>
