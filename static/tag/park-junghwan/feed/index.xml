				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Yesterday, I had the pleasure of attending another one of <a title="Yuan Zhou's Website" href="http://www.zhouyuan.com/">Yuan Zhou</a>&#8216;s Monthly Workshops!<br />
We started off with a life and death problem that is called &#8220;hunting the 6 stone bird.&#8221; Apparently it&#8217;s a very old problem that has been around for a long time, for those wondering what the shape looks like. For those who would like to try it out for themselves, here it is below:<br />
<figure id="attachment_1663" style="width: 250px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2013/01/6stonebird.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-1663" alt="6stonebird" src="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2013/01/6stonebird.png?resize=250%2C250" width="250" height="250" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Black to play.</figcaption></figure>
Afterwards, I got to hear a very captivating  review for one of <a title="Lee Chang Ho's Page" href="http://senseis.xmp.net/?YiChangHo">Lee Changho</a> 9p Vs. <a title="Park Jung Hwan's Page" href="http://senseis.xmp.net/?ParkJungHwan">Park Junghwan</a> 9p games in the most recent Ing Cup World Go Championship. It was one that was full of full of suspense, excitement, and a capturing battle on epic proportions that made Park Junghwan the decisive victor.<br />
As I listened to Yuan Zhou review the game, there were a few things that really struck me:<br />
<span id="more-1650"></span></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Professionals pay particular attention to their weak groups</strong>. They almost never let a weak group go unattended for more than a move or two.</li>
<li><strong>Professionals never play follow the leader.</strong> They try to figure out what their opponent is trying to do, and then usually come up with a move to interrupt the flow of their opponent&#8217;s game.</li>
<li><strong>Professional games tend to steer away from killing groups.</strong> The reasons lies in the fact that it is very difficult to kill a group and you usually end up sacrificing a lot of points in the process of attempting to do so.</li>
</ol>
<p>In addition, one of the biggest takeaways I had from the entire workshop is <strong>how incredibly important life and death is</strong>. I mean, sure, we all know that life and death is &#8220;important,&#8221; but I think that most players brush it off as a tedious chore that gets in the way of their game. And while I will be sure to write an article further detailing my new found appreciation for life and death, I leave you with this thought: Imagine the possibilities if you could live wherever you invaded/reduced. Wouldn&#8217;t every game become far more simpler?<br />
After the review, we had lunch and played a game with one another. As I looked back on my game, I believe that the reverse komi (-7.5 points) caused my opponent to take more risks than he needed to. In addition, our ranks are most likely about equal, so I believe that the game was rather lopsided to begin with. With that in mind, I do think that my play overall was rather poor and still shows a lack of my attention to the fundamentals of strong players.<br />
