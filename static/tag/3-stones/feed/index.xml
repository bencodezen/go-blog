<p>And we&#8217;re back to handicap games! In my kadoban with my friend Paul, it seems we are at a stalemate with 3 stones. Today&#8217;s game is one where you will see how difficult it is to truly silence an opponent&#8217;s stones in addition to how speed of development at the opening can poise White to even out the battlefield.<br />

<p>For this week, I&#8217;m happy to announce the premiere of my first official three stone handicap game (since turning a new leaf over with handicap games). At this point, my study of handicap games have come to a halt due to a necessity to revamp my training schedule, but hopefully you will still find this game review helpful in your next 3 stones handicap game!<a href="//wp-content/uploads/2013/06/2013.06.24-MGM-15.sgf"><br />

<p>My opponent made his first move: upper left star.<br />
I stared at the board as I recalled memories of playing with my friend Nate: the various approaches I tried before, the numerous times he gave me advice as to how he tries to play as white, and how I should try to play as black. I wasn&#8217;t sure what was in store for me, because this was not going to be a fun casual Monday night game. This was a game that neither of us wanted to lose. After all, I&#8217;m sure that neither of us wanted to start the tournament off with a loss. Nonetheless, only one of us would come out a victor&#8230;<br />

<p>As we were cleaning up the stones, I felt dazed as I was still in disbelief that I had managed to pull of a win, and a narrow one at that. Before I could even really collect my thoughts together however, I heard that the next pairings had been posted. I walked over and scanned the list &#8211; Ben [8k] vs. Black [12k]. At first I was relieved since I wouldn&#8217;t be playing an SDK, but then it hit me: <em><strong>I have to give him 4 stones</strong></em>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;m back and excited to be back.  So I played my first game on KGS this morning.  I have to say it&#8217;s quite an ugly game. I despise a number of my moves and misreads. So just keep that in mind when you look at it. In terms of why I&#8217;m posting it, it&#8217;s to just serve as a reminder to myself and others how different application of principles in your play is different than practicing.  One thing is for sure though, I did not let myself lose my composure when I made those mistakes. And since that was one of my main goals, I&#8217;m glad I could play well enough to come out with a half point komi win.  =D<br />

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So I think I&#8217;ll start summarizing my games with one word synopsis to describe the what I believe to be the ultimate aura and ambiance of the game. Today&#8217;s choice of word: slaughtered. In other words, like a lamb being led to the slaughter, I let a 12 kyu draw me into fighting situations where my (already poor) reading ability ruined any chance I had of beating him in the game. Let me run a few off my hand&#8230;. misreading capturing races, missing shortage of liberties, blatantly trying to save a group that was in atari which missed my reading. I do think I should have won. My strategy was far more solid overall, but I got drawn back into focusing on the fighting. There&#8217;s a little guy in my head right now yelling, &#8220;TERRITORY YOU IDIOT! THIS IS NOT FIRST CAPTURE!&#8221; Sigh&#8230; Enjoy the following horrific game that I am so ashamed to call my own.<br />

So as of this moment, I am just appalled at myself. In the blogs I&#8217;ve been reading about studying Go in China, I&#8217;ve noticed that almost there is a unanimous comment in terms of the strength of the children there. They all do one thing extremely well: fighting. Most of the bloggers comment of how they get outread in almost every situation. If I&#8217;m to even speak a word of going to study with them, I&#8217;m going to have to make sure that I at least outread my opponents here in the DDK world&#8230; (not to mention the SDK world as well). Thus, I&#8217;m switching up my regimen.<br />
Utter&#8230; brutal&#8230; training on my reading ability. KGS&#8230; I&#8217;ll see you when I return from my training.</p>
