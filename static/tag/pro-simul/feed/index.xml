<h2>Simul Games</h2>
<p>Here is a summary of all the professional simuls I played in at Go Congress:</p>
<ol>
<li><a title="Go Congress 2014 — Day 1" href="//go-congress-2014-day-1/">Day 1</a> &#8211; Dahye Lee, 4p</li>
<li><a title="Go Congress 2014 — Day 2" href="//go-congress-2014-day-2/">Day 2</a> &#8211; Ho Yuu, 6p</li>
<li><a title="Go Congress 2014 — Day 2" href="//go-congress-2014-day-2/">Day 2</a> &#8211; Jungsang Park, 9p</li>
<li><a title="Go Congress 2014 — Day 3" href="//go-congress-2014-day-3/">Day 3</a> &#8211; Bo Ding, 5p</li>
<li><a title="Go Congress 2014 — Day 3" href="//go-congress-2014-day-3/">Day 3</a> &#8211; Mariko Deguchi, 1p</li>

<li><a title="Go Congress 2014 — Day 5" href="//go-congress-2014-day-5/">Day 5</a> &#8211; Jennie Shen, 2p</li>
<li><a title="Go Congress 2014 — Day 5" href="//go-congress-2014-day-5/">Day 5</a> &#8211; Shirley Lin, 1p</li>
<li><a title="Go Congress 2014 — Day 6" href="//go-congress-2014-day-6/">Day 6</a> &#8211; Francis Meyers, 1p</li>
</ol>
<p>My goal was to play the strongest professionals that I could while experiencing as many brutal defeats from as many styles as I possibly could. In addition, while I am happy with my collection of 9 simul games, I must admit that I was aiming to hit double digits. Haha.<br />
<span id="more-5847"></span><br />
For those of you who noticed, I took some rather low handicaps in my pro simuls (went from 5 stones down to 3 stones). The reason for this is because after playing a couple simuls at the beginning, I learned that I was actually managing quite well at 4+ stones against professionals (though it’s important to remember that I’m talking about simuls which are vastly different from any legitimate game). And for those who know me, I’m always about taking a challenge head on (even if it’s completely crazy).<br />
After withdrawing from the tournament, the professional simuls became my one venue for gaining solid go experience. So naturally, the best way to do that was to challenge myself to playing my absolute best with only a 3 stone handicap. When playing with 4+ stones, I personally feel like there’s not as much opportunity for practicing decision-making in the opening and it boils down more to punishing overplayed and keeping White split. With only 3 stones, the professional will have one corner which makes for a far more interesting game. Go big or go home right? Haha.</p>
<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
<p>While I was not fully immersed in Congress and ended up withdrawing from the tournament, I really don’t feel like the trip was a waste in any sense. I made the best of it with great company and amazing food. On top of it all, I got to spend a lot of time with the pros, which was really what I wanted to do at Congress anyhow.<br />
After talking with a number of Go Congress veterans, I came to learn that Go Congress in NY was quite different from the standard Go Congress. From what I heard, most Congresses are generally had at smaller community areas (i.e., college campuses) where meals are usually together which allows for a lot more socializing and interaction. With Congress being hosted in New York, you can only imagine how many people dispersed (like I did) to either eat or even just to do touristy activities. So while it was awesome having Go Congress in New York, I am definitely interested in experiencing Go Congress in its more typical environment.<br />
At the end of the day though, I had a blast and am really glad that I got to see everyone in person. Many thanks go out to all of the professionals who took time out of their busy schedule to come and impart their knowledge to go enthusiasts like myself. Of course, extra thanks goes out to Myung (9p), Jungsang (9p), and Dahye (4p) for their help and spending time with me. It was great getting to see you all in person! Finally, a big shoutout to all my friends who I got to see and/or meet: Nate, Diego, Satoru, Michael, Dalan, Anders, Keith, Mark, Nathan, Gurujeet, Terri, Mark Lee, and Evan!<br />
And to all those who couldn’t make it, I hope that you’ve enjoyed this series and will have the opportunity to attend a Go Congress sometime! Thanks for reading!</p>

<p>The next morning we woke up and headed off to get breakfast at a popular bagel place called Brooklyn Bagels.<br />

With our stomachs full of delicious bagel, we headed down to Brooklyn so that she could try Grimaldi’s.<br />
<figure id="attachment_5781" style="width: 600px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/10/2014GC-D06-02.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-5781" src="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/10/2014GC-D06-02.jpg?resize=600%2C800" alt="The famous Grimaldi's!" width="600" height="800" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">The famous Grimaldi&#8217;s!</figcaption></figure>
We got there before they opened, so we went by the harbor to take some pictures.<br />

After walking around a bit, it was time to get in line and eat our delicious pizza!<br />
<figure id="attachment_5783" style="width: 800px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/10/2014GC-D06-10.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-5783" src="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/10/2014GC-D06-10.jpg?resize=720%2C540" alt="Margarita pizza...

And with the weather so beautiful, we felt it would be a travesty to take the metro back, so we walked across the Brooklyn Bridge!<br />
<a href="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/10/2014GC-D06-12.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5784" src="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/10/2014GC-D06-12.jpg?resize=600%2C800" alt="2014GC-D06-12" width="600" height="800" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><br />
Before I knew it though, it was time for me to head back for my simul of the day against Francis Meyers, 1p. (At this point, I was trying to play as many different professionals as possible.) The following is the game record:<br />

<p>After my game finished, I went downstairs to help Myung and Dahye take more pictures of them while they were teaching another teacher seminar.<br />

When the class wrapped up, Myung had asked if I was available to eat dinner that night (which naturally I was). However, at the last minute he had to cancel because one of his student’s parents wanted to take him out to dinner. So I left to meet up with my girlfriend and try some great falafels and crepes!<br />
<figure id="attachment_5792" style="width: 800px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/10/2014GC-D06-44.jpg"><img class="wp-image-5792 size-full" src="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/10/2014GC-D06-44.jpg?resize=720%2C540" alt="2014GC-D06-44" width="720" height="540" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">This was from a place called Taim.

By the time I got back to Hotel Pennsylvania, Myung and Jungsang were giving a game commentary on one of the games played by Andy Liu 1p.<br />
<a href="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/10/2014GC-D06-48.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5794" src="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/10/2014GC-D06-48.jpg?resize=720%2C480" alt="2014GC-D06-48" width="720" height="480" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><br />

After taking a few pictures for them, I went to see where everyone was since I didn&#8217;t see anyone in the audience. And guess where I found my friends Nate and Diego?<br />
<figure id="attachment_5796" style="width: 800px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/10/2014GC-D06-77.jpg"><img class="wp-image-5796 size-full" src="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/10/2014GC-D06-77.jpg?resize=720%2C720" alt="2014GC-D06-77" width="720" height="720" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Promoted to the big league as game recorders!</figcaption></figure>
After watching the games for a bit, I walked out of the Master’s Tournament room, I turned to my right and who do I end up seeing?!<br />

It was great to finally be able to meet Anders in person. I’m just sad I wasn’t able to hangout with him more! Oh well, at least I got the chance to meet the legendary Anders in person!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center;"><a title="Go Congress 2014 — Prelude" href="//go-congress-2014-prelude/">Prelude</a> &#8211; <a title="Go Congress 2014 — Day 1" href="//go-congress-2014-day-1/">I</a> &#8211; <a title="Go Congress 2014 — Day 2" href="//go-congress-2014-day-2/">II</a> &#8211; <strong>III</strong> &#8211; <a title="Go Congress 2014 — Day 4" href="//go-congress-2014-day-4/">IV</a> &#8211; <a title="Go Congress 2014 — Day 5" href="//go-congress-2014-day-5/">V</a> &#8211; <a title="Go Congress 2014 — Day 6" href="//go-congress-2014-day-6/">VI</a> &#8211; <a title="Go Congress 2014 — Day 7" href="//go-congress-2014-day-7/">VII </a>&#8211; <a title="Go Congress 2014 — Conclusion" href="//go-congress-2014-conclusion/">Conclusion</a></p>
<p>When I woke up, I sat in silence for a while as I thought about what I was going to do. Although some would simply shrug off the forfeit and continue playing in the tournament, I couldn’t stand the idea of continuing in the tournament. And with my brother in town and my girlfriend coming up to visit the second half of the trip, my mind was made up.<br />
When I arrived at Hotel Pennsylvania, I went and officially withdrew myself from the tournament. I know that this decision might not sit well with some of you, but it was really the best decision for me as a whole. While it would have been great to have played in the tournament, withdrawing from the tournament freed up my schedule to spend time with my brother (and girlfriend eventually) while also allowing me the freedom to do whatever I wanted (i.e., spending time with professionals).<br />
Anyhow, I then entered the tournament room to see if anyone was up and around. As I walked around, I found Diego and Gurujeet in the middle of an intense game.<br />
<a href="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/09/2014GC-D03-01.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5689" src="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/09/2014GC-D03-01.jpg?resize=720%2C540" alt="2014GC-D03-01" width="720" height="540" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><br />
I vaguely remember catching Nate and Michael before the round started and wishing them the best of luck. And before I left, I went ahead and signed up for three simuls that day. After all, I could play in tournaments anytime I wanted back at home, it’s the professionals that made Congress as epic as it is.<br />
<span id="more-5682"></span><br />
After going to breakfast, I came back to play my first simul against Zhang Yu Hong, 5p.<br />
<a href="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/09/2014GC-D03-04.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5690" src="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/09/2014GC-D03-04.jpg?resize=600%2C800" alt="2014GC-D03-04" width="600" height="800" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><br />
The game record is as follows:<br />

<p>Shortly after finishing my simul, I got a call from Myung 9p asking me if I was free to help take pictures for him and Dahye 4p while they were teaching a class. Since the next simul was not for a while and I had finished my game early, I rushed off to help them take pictures.<br />
<a href="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/09/2014GC-D03-10.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5691" src="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/09/2014GC-D03-10.jpg?resize=720%2C480" alt="2014GC-D03-10" width="720" height="480" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><br />
Once the class was done, I headed up to the top floor (where the main convention was held). When I arrived, I ran into Michael who informed me that the store was now open. Words cannot describe how excited I was to go check the store out. After all, one of the major aspects of a convention is the store where you can spend your money on souvenirs and such!<br />
<figure id="attachment_5692" style="width: 800px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/09/2014GC-D03-28.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-5692" src="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/09/2014GC-D03-28.jpg?resize=720%2C540" alt="You can see Michael in this shot!" width="720" height="540" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">You can see Michael in this shot!</figcaption></figure>
It was like being a kid in the candy store. I seriously couldn’t believe my eyes as tables full of books were stretched across the room. There wasn’t as much go equipment as I would have liked to seen, but it was a respectable collection nonetheless. And on that note, they were selling autographed fans from professionals as well! Though memory isn’t serving me well at the moment, Michael purchased one of these fans. I can’t remember which professional it was, but I’m pretty sure he’ll be commenting below on which one he got whenever he sees this.* Nonetheless, it was great to see so much go merchandise in one place.<br />
<em>*Update: Michael got a Sakata Eio fan. Many thanks to Satoru for the reminder! I should&#8217;ve remembered! Haha.</em><br />
Once we were done browsing the shop, I can&#8217;t remember if this is precisely when it happened, but Michael and I finished our game from yesterday. The following is the game record:<br />

<p>After the game, I was scheduled for another simul and parted ways with Michael. I was slotted to play against another Chinese professional, Ding Bo, 5p. The following is the game record:<br />

<p>After the simul, I can’t really remember what I did; but I imagine it consisted of exploring New York city with my brother and trying more food. Towards the evening though, I came back to Hotel Pennsylvania to play my third and final simul of the day. Nate, Michael and Dalan were scheduled to play against one of the new Japanese professional, Francis Meyers, 1p. You can see them here in action!<br />
<a href="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/09/2014GC-D03-29.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5693" src="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/09/2014GC-D03-29.jpg?resize=720%2C540" alt="2014GC-D03-29" width="720" height="540" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><br />

I had signed up to play against a Japanese professional as well, Deguchi Mariko, 1p. Satoru was on the waiting list, but fortunately the people who signed up didn’t show up and he was allowed to play.<br />
<a href="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/09/2014GC-D03-40.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5702" src="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/09/2014GC-D03-40.jpg?resize=720%2C540" alt="2014GC-D03-40" width="720" height="540" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><br />
The following is the game record:<br />

<p>After the game, I ran into Myung who asked me if I was up for getting food. Like he needed to ask. Haha. Jungsang hadn’t even yet however, so we waited for him to finish him simul game before heading out.<br />
<figure id="attachment_5701" style="width: 800px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/09/2014GC-D03-38.jpg"><img class="wp-image-5701 size-full" src="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/09/2014GC-D03-38.jpg?resize=720%2C540" alt="2014GC-D03-38" width="720" height="540" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">That guy stared at the board for so long trying to find a way to win&#8230; Let it go man.</figcaption></figure>
To keep a long story short, Jungsang’s simul game was an informal one he agreed to that took FOREVER. Seriously, the guy was playing to win and taking forever to make his moves. And when it comes to go etiquette, that’s extremely rude when you consider the fact that it is an informal game that also is a simul.<br />
While we waited, I went around and took pictures of the crazy go event that was going on on the other side of the room. Here you’ll see pictures of go in all shapes and sizes:<br />

After what seemed like forever, Myung, Jungsang and I were finally off to grab Shake Shack again. Haha. Except this time, we didn’t have the luxury of eating in since it was so crowded. So we brought the food back to Hotel Pennsylvania and holed up in one of the lecture rooms on the 6th floor.<br />
As we were sitting there and eating our delicious burgers, we talked about numerous things. Of course, as usual though, there were times where Jungsang wanted to say something more complicated and switched to Korean. And as I sat there listening to Myung and Jungsang talk, I came to a conclusion: I need to learn Korean. There’s just no getting around it. Haha. After all, with how invested I am in the go world and my increasing exposure to Korean professionals, it just didn’t make sense not to learn it.<br />
Anyhow, before long it was time for everyone to head off to bed and get some rest. And as I prepared to go to sleep, I couldn’t help but feel even more assured in my decision to withdraw from the tournament. After all, if I had participated in the tournament, I probably would have been too tired to play in all those simul games. And if I left early to find food, I wouldn’t have gotten a chance to hangout with Myung and Jungsang! No matter though, I had experienced the day fully and nodded off to sleep with no regrets.</p>

<p>The next day I woke up late. Since I knew that my games took a long time, I figured that it would be best for me to grab breakfast before heading off to the match. After all, the worst thing that would happen is that I would have less time. Right?<br />
When I arrived, I found everyone sitting and playing their matches. As I looked down the pairings list, I noticed that my name was already marked with results. F? My opponent’s name circled? What the heck? Does that mean what I think it means?<br />
As I scanned the list, I saw there were quite a few others as well. So I rushed off to find the tournament director, and sure enough, it was what I feared: forfeit.<br />
<span id="more-5665"></span><br />
Needless to say, I was furious. After all, the worst I expected was that my time would be reduced. I was fuming for quite some time, and tried my best to calm down. I even tried to read through the entire handbook thinking that at least if it were written somewhere I would at least acknowledge my ignorance. Nope. Nothing.<br />
To be honest, this bothered me for quite some time. I tried my best to let it go, but I just couldn’t help myself from feeling so wronged. Some tried to tell me that it was announced during before the match, but announcements are only useful if you were there to hear it. And if you were there to hear it, I don’t really think you need to worry about a forfeit rule. And also, during the registration phase, they ask you point blank if you plan on playing in all the tournament rounds. What’s the point of that if you’re going to forfeit people after they’re late?! Especially when the rule is nowhere to be found!!<br />
Once all the matches were over, I caught up with Michael and started a game with him. We had to adjourn midway through the game since the pro events were starting, but don&#8217;t worry, we get around to finishing the game (which I&#8217;ll show the kifu of later on).<br />
As Michael went off to his pro event, I waited around in hopes of getting a simul game against Ho Yuu, 6p. Fortunately for me, the people who had signed up didn’t show up and I was able to get a seat.<br />

Here are the results of that game:<br />

<p>Though I ended up losing, he told me that I played quite well and would have actually won if I had not let me connection get cut apart. It was a game I was certainly proud of and one that helped me release some of my frustration since I poured all my energy into playing the best go I could possibly play.<br />
Everyone had dispersed at that point, so I wandered around a bit while waiting for the next simul to begin. For this next one, I was really hoping to be able to get a simul against Park Jungsang, 9p. Yes, the very same person I just had late dinner with last night! The reason I was a bit iffy on this one however, is because it was a simul that was reserved for dan players.<br />
Nonetheless, I went ahead and asked if I could play anyhow. Thanks to Jungsang’s kindness, I was allowed to play even though I wasn’t technically registered as a dan player.<br />

The following is the game record:<br />

<p>Here’s the thing. I’ve played against a fair of number of professionals at this point in simul games, but the feeling I was left with after Jungsang crushed me was incredible. Even though I was well aware of how strong professionals could be, the simul against Jungsang took it to a whole new level of respect and awe.<br />
Once I was done with the game, it seemed like everyone had run off in different directions. Since my brother and I hadn’t eaten lunch yet, I decided that we would go ahead and go grab something to eat.<br />
After being indecisive for a while, we finally decided on this sushi place. Funny thing is that we didn’t see anything impressive on the menu when we got there, and ended up trying their yakitori instead.<br />
<a href="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/09/2014GC-D02-19.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5672" src="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/09/2014GC-D02-19.jpg?resize=720%2C540" alt="2014GC-D02-19" width="720" height="540" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><br />
It was a fantastic time and I had a blast hanging out with my brother. During this time, I vented about my frustration with what happened and my thoughts on what I wanted to do next. To experience that injustice of getting burned by a rule that wasn’t written and available to all players really put a damper on my experience at Congress. I mean seriously, it’s the equivalent of finding out that there is a rule that your opponent gets an extra 20 points of komi if the game is longer than 250 moves.<br />
To be honest, the rest of the day is a bit hazy to me as I try to recall it now. The forfeit was rather traumatic and affected me more than I would like to admit.What I can say for sure though, is that I spent a good part of that day evaluating whether or not I actually wanted to continue playing in a tournament.<br />
And if memory serves me correctly, my brother and I wandered around a bit more and got Halal Guys (aka famous food truck in NY for a $6 meal that is amazing). And after that food adventure, I went to dinner with Diego, Michael, Satoru, and Diego’s friend Mark. It was a fun dinner full of great conversation and I got a glimpse into the awesome world of judo as well. While the forfeit was a big damper on the day, I’m glad I was able to end the day with friends and good times.<br />
<em>Update: I just wanted to clarify that I&#8217;m not in any way saying that my conduct in being late to the match is excusable or acceptable. If I could have gone back and done it again, I would have ran to Congress first and at least let my opponent know I would be back after 10-15 minutes. The reason for my frustration and rant resides in the way the rule itself is implemented / enforced. While it is common courtesy to simply be on time for things, there are numerous reasonable situations where a person could be running late. And yes, sometimes people make incorrect decisions in the moment, but it should be penalized in a way that is fair for all.</em></p>
