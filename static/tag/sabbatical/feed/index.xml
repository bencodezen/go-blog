				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So I&#8217;ve started reading my go books again, and I did not realize how poorly I&#8217;ve been playing lately. As a result, I&#8217;m taking a break from online games (once again) because I&#8217;ve only been reinforcing really poor playing habits.<br />
At first I was troubled as to why I was still a DDK, but it does not surprise me any longer. It&#8217;s time for me to undergo some serious training.<br />
Go ability transformation here I come!<br />
<em>UPDATE: So I noticed I tend to get overly frustrated and then determine to take a &#8220;sabbatical&#8221; only to find myself playing again the next day. Thus, scratch that idea, it&#8217;s just time to play better.</em></p>

So I know I wrote about coming back from the sabbatical, but it looks like I&#8217;ll have to retract that statement unfortunately. There are some things that have come up in my life that are going to require a significant amount of attention and energy. So it&#8217;ll be some time before I will be able to attend to Go for awhile. I&#8217;m more than willing to play with anyone here and there if they want. The difference is that I won&#8217;t be able to just hang around KGS anymore to play.<br />
To all my fellow Go players, thanks for all the help so far. I&#8217;m sorry I have to dip for a little while, but rest assured you can always get a game with me anytime you like. Just shoot me an e-mail or comment on the blog and we&#8217;ll set something up. Take care everyone!

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sorry everyone. It&#8217;s been awhile since I&#8217;ve been able to seriously update or post anything. I&#8217;m currently on a mini-sabbatical and trying to get a lot of things in my life straightened out.  Progress on my Go studies has been close to none so it&#8217;ll be interesting to see how I do when I get back to the game.  I&#8217;m planning on doing a major overhaul on the blog so that it is a bit easier to navigate and just heavier on content. So I&#8217;ll be back in a week to give you guys what I&#8217;ll be projecting.  Till then!</p>
