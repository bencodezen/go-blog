<h2 style="text-align: center;">Slate and Shell Go Stones &#8211; Sample Pack &#8211; Size 36 Biconvex</h2>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> &#8220;This is a sample pack of our size 36 slate and shell Go stones, which are among the highest quality Go stones available. It contains three black stones and three white stones. Size 36 refers to the thickness of the stone (in this case 10.4 mm or 0.41 inches). The additional thickness and weight of these stones gives them a pleasant feeling in your hand and produces a sharp and satisfying snapping sound when the stones are played.&#8221; &#8211; GoGameGuru<br />

<strong>What&#8217;s the best aspect about this product?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>It&#8217;s slate and shell. &#8216;Nuff said.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What is the weakest aspect of this product?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Size 36 is pretty big, so if someone is not accounting for it, their board might seem a bit crowded if the board is not drawn to accommodate for it.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Is it durable?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>It&#8217;s slate and shell. Haha. I&#8217;d recommend you handle with care.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Bottom Line</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Totally worth the money if you wanted to ever check out what slate and shell stones are like before investing a lot of money into a set.</li>

[expand title=&#8221;My Review&#8221; trigclass=&#8221;expandTitle&#8221; expanded=&#8221;true&#8221;]
The sample comes in a nice little cloth bag with the BadukBrother logo clearly marked.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/02/slateshellsample02.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-4594" alt="slateshellsample02" src="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/02/slateshellsample02.jpg?resize=490%2C368" width="490" height="368" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">When you remove the stones from the bag, you can see that it is in a nice plastic bag (which provides the actual protection in shipping).</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/02/slateshellsample03.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-4595" alt="slateshellsample03" src="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/02/slateshellsample03.jpg?resize=368%2C490" width="368" height="490" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">With the stones removed, you can see them glistening in the light. Very pretty. =)</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/02/slateshellsample04.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-4596" alt="slateshellsample04" src="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/02/slateshellsample04.jpg?resize=490%2C368" width="490" height="368" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The one thing I will say is that the beautiful pattern you are used to seeing on shell stones was harder to capture in the pictures. I think that this is due to the fact that the size of the stones (and for those who don&#8217;t know, size 36 is pretty large) and that this is a sample pack is a reason for why the pattern is more faded compared to the set that I own. However, since this is not a full set, I would not take this as an alarming fact since your purpose with this sample pack is to really get a feel for slate and shell as opposed to just the look.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/02/slateshellsample05.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-4597" alt="slateshellsample05" src="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/02/slateshellsample05.jpg?resize=490%2C368" width="490" height="368" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">At the end of the day, they arrived in perfect condition which is precisely what someone needs when they want to find out if they really want to own a set of slate and shell. If you&#8217;re interested in getting a slate and shell stone set but worried if the value is worth the price, be sure to grab one of these sample packs from GoGameGuru to help you make an informed decision. Good luck!</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">PS. I do own a full set of slate and shell stones, so let me know if you ever have any questions.</p>

<h3>Detailed Review*</h3>
<p>When purchasing my first go set, this was by far the most anticipated piece of equipment. After all, the prospect of playing with real stones and making the aesthetic sound as you play each move was so exciting! However, I digress, here is what the package looked like when it came in. As with all other items I&#8217;ve received from <a href="http://www.ymimports.com/">Yellow Mountain Imports</a>, everything was packaged and protected very well.<br />
<figure id="attachment_2351" style="width: 300px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2010/09/yunziset.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2351" alt="Top layer of styrofoam (not in picture)" src="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2010/09/yunziset.jpg?resize=300%2C225" width="300" height="225" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Top layer of styrofoam (not in picture)</figcaption></figure>
When you open the bag, here&#8217;s what you see.<br />
<a href="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2010/09/yunziset03.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2353" alt="yunziset03" src="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2010/09/yunziset03.jpg?resize=300%2C225" width="300" height="225" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><br />
<a href="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2010/09/yunziset04.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2354" alt="yunziset04" src="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2010/09/yunziset04.jpg?resize=300%2C225" width="300" height="225" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><br />
For those who are have never purchased yunzi before, they do not come all fresh and shiny when you receive them. The stones come with a white powder coat in order to protect from damage during shipment.<br />

Although it requires a bit of elbow grease and time to get them shined up and ready to go, I personally found the process very enjoyable and rewarding. It&#8217;s hard to say what it is exactly, but there&#8217;s just something about personally taking care of your stones that makes your stones that much more enjoyable to use. For those who are curious as to what the process is for cleaning yunzi stones, visit <a title="How to Oil Your Yunzi Stones" href="//how-to-oil-your-yunzi-stones/">my guide</a> for more information.<br />
<strong>Size &amp; Weight:</strong> The stones have a solid weight to them that gives a great feeling when picking each one up and placing it on the board. They fit very well on the Shin-Kaya Board that I purchased, but keep in mind that each  board is unique in what their max stone size is.<br />
<strong>Durability:</strong> I have not found durability to be an issue. Granted, I have not tried taking a sledgehammer to them, but I think it could survive anything short of that.<br />
<strong>Usability:</strong> This set is a fantastic all in one package. Great for leaving at home or bringing with you to the local coffee shop.<br />
If you&#8217;re in the market for biconvex stones, this is the set for you.** The bag carries the stones pretty well. The bowls are freaking awesome. And I love the feel of real stones in my hands. Though the price may seem a little high, you are buying a quality set that has so much value and will last a long time.<br />
*<em>Since most people are probably more interested in the stones, I have separated out the bowls and bag review to prevent the review from being overcluttered. You can find the reviews at the following links: <a title="Equipment Review: Kitani Jujube Bowls" href="//equipment-review-kitani-jujube-bowls/">Kitani Jujube Bowls</a> &amp; <a title="Equipment Review: Go Stones and Bowls Carrying Bag" href="//equipment-review-go-stones-and-bowls-carrying-bag/">Go Stones and Bowls Carrying Bag</a>.</em><br />
