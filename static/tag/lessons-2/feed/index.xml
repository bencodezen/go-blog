				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Kaz&#8217;s Online Go School is finally here! For those who don&#8217;t know about Kaz, I discovered him from his site (<a href="http://www.kazsensei.com/">http://www.kazsensei.com/</a>) a couple of years ago and have been waiting for his website to become fully live and functional. The website is a bit hard to navigate, but after going through it, I thought that it would be great if I ever got a chance to learn from him. So after waiting for a couple of years, I am psyched to tell you that the opportunity is finally here!<br />
So for those curious about this online go school, let me start with this: <strong>The first session of Kaz&#8217;s Online Go School is 8 classes for only $6 USD.</strong> Now that I have your attention, here&#8217;s my elevator pitch for the school.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>His teaching style emphasizes teaching amateur players who are adults which is quite unique!</strong> In fact, he states in his ad that the range of players he normally teaches is 30 to 70+ years old and talks about how teaching children is very different from teaching adults! So in other words, it sounds like he has a lot of experience working with amateur players (which is precisely what many of us need).</li>
<li><strong>Kaz will generate a text for student&#8217;s to study after each lesson.</strong> It&#8217;s great to get online reviews and such, but I think it&#8217;s great that Kaz will also be generating offline content for students to study as well in order to reinforce the concepts learned from the last lesson.</li>
<li><strong>You get 8 two-hour group lessons with Kaz for only $6 USD.</strong> This is such an incredible value and such a great deal if anyone has done even the slightest bit of research on the other online schools available. For those who haven&#8217;t, one of the most popular online go schools charges about $135 a month. So yeah. &#8216;Nuff said.</li>
</ol>
<p>Bottom line: I think any player who has even been remotely interested in participating in an online go school needs to do this. There is just no reason for why you shouldn&#8217;t give this a shot for $6 USD. It&#8217;s seriously an incredible deal.<a href="//wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Kaz-Go-Problem-Set.zip"><br />
</a><br />
For more details on his school, you can find it here <a href="//wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Kaz’s-Online-Go-School.pdf">Kaz’s Online Go School (PDF)</a>. I took the liberty of taking his email and updating some of the language and structure in order to make it easier to find the information you need. And for those interested in the free problems set that he attached to his email, you can download it [download label=&#8221;here&#8221;]//wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Kaz-Go-Problem-Set.zip[/download].<br />
And just in case it isn&#8217;t clear, I have already paid my $6 and will definitely be participating in this. Let me know if you guys have any other questions and I&#8217;ll do my best to answer them. Hope to see you in class!</p>

</ul>
<p><span id="more-1393"></span></p>
<h3>Detailed Review</h3>
<h4>Readability &#8211; 10 / 10</h4>
<p>When it comes to readability, I&#8217;m not sure there&#8217;s a single go book out there that can outclass Kageyama&#8217;s ability to show his humorous and delightful personality through his writing. There is almost never a dull moment in this book. Often times, he will seem to be going off on a tangent (like baseball), but he will always find a way to bring it back full circle to emphasize one of his points. His pragmatic and straight forward advice is something that every go player can make use of, regardless of how strong you desire to be. In fact, even if we set aside the actual treasure trove of go advice that is in this book, I would argue that the entertainment value of his writing makes the book worth every penny.</p>
<h4>Content Quality &#8211; 10 / 10</h4>
<p>Although this is not your classic tsumego book, it does have a similar style to the <a href="http://senseis.xmp.net/?ElementaryGoSeries">Elementary Go Series</a> where there are a few problems at the end of most chapters. In addition, I will be the first to admit that some of these problems are rather difficult and can be discouraging if you are under the impression you need to be able to solve them the first time you see them. In fact, the value of this book lies in its ability to expose you to so many different concepts and ideas. Considering the size of the book and the how short each of the chapters are, the amount of content he covers is nothing short of incredible.</p>
<h4>Final Thoughts</h4>
<p>Although this is my third time reading the book, and it still has not lost a bit of its charm. I continue to learn something new every time I read it, and never fail to crack a smile when Kageyama goes on one of his rants about how amateur players always try to find shortcuts to reading ladders. Nonetheless, this is truly a classic that I believe will never be outdated. So do yourself a favor, and if you are going to only have a small collection of go books, this is definitely one you will want to have.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 style="text-align: center"><em>Weekly Go Wednesday, Issue #14</em></h2>
<p><a href="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2013/01/wgw14.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1723" alt="Proofreading Credit to TitanWebMarketingSolutoins" src="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2013/01/wgw14.jpg?resize=300%2C235" width="300" height="235" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><br />
While nothing can replace the experience of playing games, one of the greatest mistakes that players make is to play games endlessly without any mind as to why they are winning or losing. There is nothing wrong with this approach as a whole, but it is contrary to the whole notion of getting stronger. After all, how can anyone learn from their mistake if they never knew it existed?<br />
The one thing we have to remember as kyu players is that we often fall victim to being ignorant to fundamental go principles. It&#8217;s not so much that we&#8217;re not aware of them, but applying them in our game is a completely different story. Often times in the middle of a game, we will think one way and will not realize our mistake till later on. As a result, an extremely important aspect of getting stronger is to review your games.<br />
<span id="more-1717"></span><br />
Here is an overall guideline (in order of level of effort) as to how you should approach your game reviews:<br />
<strong>#1. Start by reviewing the game on your own (or with a friend).</strong><br />
Casually go through the game and see what things you might have done differently, or how you think the game might have gone if you had responded differently. The important thing to remember is not to spend a lot of time going over the game, but to go over any mistakes you&#8217;ve made and learn from it as best as you possibly can. This is the absolute bare minimum you should do after each game.<br />
<strong>#2. Get a stronger player to review your game (preferably at least 3 stones stronger than you).</strong><br />
Stronger players fulfill the gap that we lack when it comes to understanding why certain things work and certain things don&#8217;t. In fact, it is their guidance that helps bring us back from the edge of self-delusion when one of our &#8220;brilliant tesujis&#8221; turns out to be easily countered by a different response. So make no mistake, this type of review can do wonders for your understanding of the game.<br />
<strong>#3. Come prepared to a game review with a stronger player (again, preferably at least 3 stones stronger).</strong><br />
If you want to get the most out of your reviews, come to a review prepared to with the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Pick three moves that you are really proud of.</li>
<li>Pick three moves that you were not sure about.</li>
<li>Pick three moves that you thought were bad in hindsight.</li>
</ol>
<p>By doing this, you will be doing yourself a huge favor since your reviewer will have a clear insight into how you are thinking. In addition, this will allow the reviewer to easily tailor the lessons towards your habits and style of play instead of making it generic.<br />
So yes. While <a title="Even Games with Stronger Players" href="//even-games-with-stronger-players/">last week&#8217;s Weekly Go Wednesday</a> focused on how playing against stronger players against stronger players is a good method for getting stronger, the game reviews that come afterwards can make the difference between feeling awful about yourself and having your eyes opened to brand new possibilities.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Rating: 4 /5 Ponnuki</h2>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">Synopsis:</h3>
<ul>
<li>A fantastic resource for game reviews when you don&#8217;t have time for real-time reviews.</li>
<li>It&#8217;s FREE!!!!</li>
<li>The reviews are not instantaneous, but what you&#8217;d expect from a volunteer based service?</li>
</ul>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">Detailed Review:</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;"><a title="Go Teaching Ladder Website" href="http://gtl.xmp.net/">GoTeachingLadder</a> is a fantastic resource for players want to have their games reviewed.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">As it is a completely volunteer based service, one cannot expect the same level of reviews that you might receive from strong players online; but this does not diminish the value of this website.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The process for submitting a game for review is very simple:</p>
<ol>
<li>Click the link for submitting a game.</li>
<li>Fill out the form.</li>
<li>Verify that the information is correct.</li>
<li>Submit your request.</li>
<li>Enjoy your game review when you receive it!</li>
</ol>
<p>One of the things about GTL that makes it so effective is the fact that they allow you to ask specific questions about your game so that you can be sure those aspects are given the attention you desire. If it weren&#8217;t for this aspect, the value of the reviews would be diminished greatly.<br />
The only downside to this resource is the fact that the wait time can be up to a couple weeks at a time depending on your reviewer. While you should expect nothing less from a volunteer based site, this can diminish the value of the game reviews since you may not quite remember the lessons as vividly as shortly after the game.<br />
