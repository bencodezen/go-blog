<h2>Thoughts</h2>
<p>This week has been rather unfruitful in regards to training and what not. Been really busy with work, and as many of you are aware, I&#8217;ve been pretty busy trying to recap all that happened at last week&#8217;s <a title="North American Go Convention — Day 1" href="//north-american-go-convention-day-1/">North American Go Convention</a>. My games have been somewhat hit or miss. Not the happiest with my performance this week, but I plan on finding ways to continue improving my game.<br />
Meanwhile, the next week will probably be spent restructuring my schedule regarding blog posts and how training will all fit together without detracting from other aspects of my life. I&#8217;ll be sure to keep everyone posted when I have a finalized schedule that you all can look forward to. =)</p>
