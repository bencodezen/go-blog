				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Originally, as you all well know, I had intended on just continuing abstaining from ranked games, but it seems that the time has come for me to return to ranked games. What spurred this sudden change of ideas?<br />
Well, I was talking to Tilwen today, and he said the following, &#8220;You&#8217;ll have to earn your true rank soon so that you can no longer just say that you won games because you are lucky that stronger players are underestimating you since you have a 6k next to your name.&#8221;<br />
As I sat there struck by his comment, other players&#8217; comments about my true rank began to flood into my head.<br />
&#8220;Oh man&#8230; are people starting to see me as a sandbagger?!&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>(o.O)</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">For those who don&#8217;t know what sandbagging is, it&#8217;s purposely lowering your rank so that you can easily win. Definitely not my definition of enjoyment.</p>
<p>Starting off my return to ranked games has been rough though: four straight losses. It was so unbelievably frustrating at the time because I had just spent the last month playing against stronger players and actually managing to win in even games. So to lose consecutively to players that are supposedly around my &#8220;fake 6k&#8221; rank has been rather depressing. Although why I&#8217;m losing is not a mystery to me, it is due to one thing and one thing only: my ego.<br />
More on this later&#8230;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Yesterday I went on tilt and promptly lost four games in a row. After that, with no sleep and a ten page paper on my mind, it was game over for any other games I tried to start. It wasn&#8217;t until last night where I finally ended my streak with a win over a 14k.<br />
So the question for new players is: how do we prevent this tilt? It&#8217;s something that I hope to be able to write about in length in the future; but for now, I hope that the following perspective will help shed some light for you.<br />
<span id="more-60"></span><br />
It dawned on me last night that I&#8217;ve been spending most of my days trying to improve at Go. There&#8217;s nothing wrong with this, except I feel that perhaps I may have neglected other priorities of mine. Why did I do so? I believed that by improving at Go I could derive my own weaknesses and improve myself in the real world. While I have found that I have achieved that so far, the reverse is the same as well. If I can improve myself in other areas outside of the board, it will show up in my play as well.<br />
So what&#8217;s the critical point? Everything is connected with everything. You can spend 24/7 studying Go books, but if this devotion takes away from your other priorities, you&#8217;ll find that the emotional stress and pressure will eventually impact your game. Focusing solely on Go is like staring at one portion of the board, you may play a perfect corner, but you&#8217;ve lost the rest of the board.<br />
And one more thing, I&#8217;m going to stop paying attention to my rank. No I won&#8217;t naively be ignorant of it, but<strong> it&#8217;s pointless to keep letting KGS monopolize my own perception of my strength</strong>. It makes me feel bummed when I rabbit jump, and frankly there are far more opponents that I want to outclass than simply gaining a stone on KGS. So from this point on, it&#8217;s all introspection and getting stronger on my own&#8230; regardless of KGS&#8217; estimation of my strength. My opponent is myself, and my opponents are simply there to test my strength and help me grow.<br />
If you&#8217;re wondering where my emotional tilt began, it all started with my first game where I did not protect a vital cut and could not regain control of the game past that point. It occurs at Move 47.<br />

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So I&#8217;m unbelievably busy with grad school work now, but that didn&#8217;t stop me from trying to play today. I have a ten page paper to finish by 7:00pm, and I played go&#8230; I know&#8230;. Anyhow, I lost my first game due to failing to defend a single point. Unfortunately, with all the stress, lack of sleep, and urgency of other things that I need to do, I went on tilt and could not regain composure. Against my better judgment, I went ahead and played another game after that. No good either. Two resignations. Ugh&#8230;<br />
The lesson of the day is simple. It&#8217;s just like Yuan Zhou told me, &#8220;When you play Go, you don&#8217;t want to have other distractions or other tasks eagerly waiting your attention.&#8221; And I definitely think that all this school stuff definitely impacted the quality of my games. sigh. It was two games&#8230; need to just move on.<br />
Make that three losses&#8230; this is just an awful streak. I&#8217;m being outfought in every battle&#8230; absolutely pathetic&#8230;</p>
