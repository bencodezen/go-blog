				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A couple days ago, I was doing some mitt work with my partner at the local boxing gym. About halfway into the round, I was getting visibly tired and close to exhaustion from trying to push beyond my limits. It was then though, that my partner said something that struck me:</p>
<blockquote><p>Remember to breathe. Control your breathing.</p></blockquote>
<p>Seems like such an obvious statement no? After all, don&#8217;t we all breathe subconsciously? Without breathing, we&#8217;d all be dead! What a stupid thing to say!<br />
If you think such crude and rudimentary thoughts though, you are missing the point. The fact is that while I might have been &#8220;breathing,&#8221; the fact is that I was so caught up in punching and keeping good form that I forgot to breathe half the time. You might exclaim, &#8220;How does one forget to breathe Ben? That&#8217;s ridiculous!&#8221; And you&#8217;re right to some extent, but instead of breathing more efficiently through my nose and exhaling through my mouth, I was holding my breath half the time (without even realizing it due to concentrating so hard on punching and maintaing form) and taking short gasps of air with my mouth in between. It&#8217;s no wonder that I was winded and at the point of near collapse before the round was even halfway through.<br />
So how does this relate to go?<br />
The reason I went to great lengths to explain breathing in boxing is because it occurred to me that a similar thing was happening to kyu players. Instead of breathing however, I would make the analogy that kyu players often players fail to play moves with the whole board in mind. Similar to breathing, it is a given that every move that is played affects the board in some way shape or form. However, if we just play moves without making a conscious effort to understand or give it a purpose in regard to the entire board, it is just as if we are going through the motions of punching without remembering to breathe properly. And then the next thing you know, you&#8217;re out of breath and your opponent cuts off a big group and delivers the knockout punch.<br />
Of course with time and experience, playing moves with respect to the entire board will be second nature; but while we still remain the weak kyu players that we are, we must be sure to make a conscious effort to take the entire board into consideration at all times. So to put my partner&#8217;s advice into another context:</p>
<blockquote><p>Remember to consider the board as a whole before playing your next move.</p></blockquote>

I&#8217;ve recently taken an interest in boxing, and I have to say that the more I study it, the more I can&#8217;t help but see similarities between boxing and go. Here are a few off the top of my head:</p>
<ol>
<li>There are two players in each match.</li>
<li>Regardless of how badly each player might want to win, there can only be one victor at the end of the match.</li>
<li>Exchanging blows with your opponent is inevitable and necessary for a good match.</li>
<li>There are different styles of boxing that seem analogous the go styles as well (e.g., technician/point counter, infighter/fighting, etc.).</li>
</ol>
<p>But most importantly of all, <strong>those who rise to the top are those who are instinctively faithful to the fundamentals</strong>.<br />
After all, look at any boxer&#8217;s training regimen and what are you going to find? Running, jump rope, shadow boxing, combinations, sparring. Repeat. Repeat. Repeat. There might be a few deviations occasionally depending on what muscle groups they need to build for certain techniques, but the training menu almost always consists of the fundamentals. And what does a fight primarily consist of? The basics: jab, cross, hook, uppercut, jab, jab&#8230;<br />
So how is this relevant to go? Well, one topic that I know runs rampant throughout the community is the idea of getting stronger (especially for kyu players who want to reach dan level). And as I begin to study boxing, I can&#8217;t help but wonder what a go players training menu should look like? I mean sure, everyone will say do life and death problems, but that advice is so incredibly generic and subject to interpretation (as to how to study it) that I would guarantee that many players have gone astray and become frustrated with their progress because they couldn&#8217;t figure out what to do to keep getting better.<br />
I know that no one has a magical formula for getting better at go; but I think that there is more wisdom that can be offered from my study of boxing in terms of trying to discover better guidelines for designing a training menu for go. After all, it&#8217;s not about knowing the most complicated joseki or knowing the common trick plays, but to instead constantly improve the fundamentals.<br />
More on this as I continue researching and testing out different things&#8230;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>In case it wasn&#8217;t apparent to everyone, this week has been entirely centered around boxing analogies along with handicap go. There hasn&#8217;t been as many ranked games as I might have liked, but the amount of go I&#8217;ve been playing/studying seems to be harmonizing much better with the rest of my life. Still fine tuning a number of things, but just glad to not feel overwhelemed by go anymore.</p>
<h2>Games</h2>
<ul>
<li><span style="line-height: 13px;">KGS &#8211; 2 games (2 wins : 0 losses)</span></li>
<li>DGS &#8211; 2 ongoing games</li>
<li>Nova &#8211; 3 ongoing games</li>
</ul>
<h2>Training</h2>
<ul>
<li><span style="line-height: 13px;">20 tsumego problems each day.</span></li>
<li>Worked <em>Mastering the Basics: The Basics of Go Strategy</em>.</li>
<li>Started reading <em>Kage&#8217;s Secret Chronicles of Handicap Go.</em></li>
</ul>
<h2>Lessons Learned</h2>
<ol>
<li>When attacking, strike at the vital points while maintaining strength and not overextending yourself.</li>
<li>It&#8217;s okay to let things live or give your opponents points, as long as you are getting more in return.</li>
<li>Don&#8217;t over think your moves in turn based go. Rather than spend hours staring at the screen trying to make the perfect move, you will learn and gain more by playing more games and learning from your mistakes.</li>
</ol>

In an effort not to spoil it for anyone who plans on reading or watching the show, all I will say is that his faithfulness to his fundamentals was incredibly moving. No matter what the situation, people&#8217;s faith in the fundamentals is what allow them to pull themselves out of the most difficult situations.<br />
Aside from that though, I&#8217;ve had one of the most eye opening lessons to date. My whole perspective on moyos and just go in general has completely changed. Granted, integrating this new perspective into my play will probably be terribly exhausting for awhile; but ho ho ho&#8230;. this could change everything&#8230;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Lately I have been on a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fighting_Spirit_(manga)">Hajime no Ippo</a> kick and can&#8217;t seem to put it down. With each match that I read, I&#8217;m severely reminded of how much they endure in order to be crowned the victor at the end of each match. Of course, some of their battles are won in a one round KO; but for the most part, the victor rarely comes out unscathed and is often sweating profusely and breathing heavily when holding is victory pose.<br />
Being the go player that I am, I couldn&#8217;t help but draw connections between the two sports (albeit physical vs. mental, but you get my point). Too often, I have found that players are often looking for the easy win. The one-sided match where only a miracle might possibly save the opponent. And I&#8217;ll be honest, I have been and still am (to some degree) guilty of that. After all, it feels good when you&#8217;re knocking your opponent around and in full control of the game.<br />
However, the pursuit of that type of dominating game is unhealthy for a go player. More often than not, the constant attempt at trying to throw that KO punch will be met with a timely counter that reverses the position and knocks you out before you know it. It is a terrible mindset that will only corrode your go as time goes on.<br />
Instead, we must strive to be patient. Use your strengths and strike while maintaining a manageable level of risk. Endure your opponents attacks and the dips that will inevitably come with most games. All you need to remember, as you parry the board against your opponent, is that you don&#8217;t need to win by KO or by 30 points. You only need <strong>half a point</strong> to be the victor.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I recently finished the arc (in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fighting_Spirit_(manga)">Hajime no Ippo</a>) where Ippo and Sendou fighting for the championship, and I couldn&#8217;t help but realize that a game of go is very much like a match in boxing. With each stone, each player prepares the battlefield. Before you know it, a furious chase and battle occurs where the one is rushing forward in a series of attacks while the other is stepping backwards and trying to gain solid footing. When the barrage is over however, the tide changes as the opponent regains his foothold and then returns a series of attack back as you try to ensure the safety of your attacking group.<br />
In the end, a player&#8217;s ability to win a game from start to finish lies in his/her ability to withstand the exchange of blows that is sure to come in every game. Of course, there are times when the game simply boils down to a huge hitting match where the game can only in KO. So unless it is between two opponents of different caliber, no player can expect to get out of a game unscathed and unchallenged.<br />
After finishing the arc, I realized that I had forgotten the endurance and tenacity a player must bring to every game. There is no room for pity or doubt. There is only room for those who&#8217;s fighting spirits echo even after the last stone has been placed on the board.</p>
