Bleh. I&#8217;ve failed so far as to keeping regular blog posts once I go up to Baltimore on the weekends&#8230;. I&#8217;ll need to fix that. But regardless, I played quite a bit with Todd over the past couple days&#8230; and I have to say it&#8217;s been frustrating yet enlightening. I know I&#8217;ve said this multiple times in the past&#8230; but I&#8217;d say that the implications of the line that &#8220;Go is 98% patience&#8221; is &#8220;Read ahead you idiot.&#8221;<br />
I&#8217;m not the first nor will I be the last to say that I believe that Go really does reveal a lot about a person&#8217;s character. What I&#8217;ve realized&#8230; is that I&#8217;m not as patient as I thought I was. I like to get things done quickly and to use talent and intuition to hope for the best result. The only problem is that this mindset doesn&#8217;t translate well in Go and in the bigger picture&#8230; life.<br />
Second epiphany is that my asinine &#8220;wanna-be pro&#8221; self keeps trying to create all these clever trick plays (e.g. shortage of liberty situations or awesome snapbacks). What does that mean for a player still in the DDK who plays an opponent of shodan strength? Complete and utter failure. As Todd so kindly reminded me, &#8220;Go is not about killing stones&#8230;.&#8221; I must&#8217;ve heard and read this about a hundred times since I&#8217;ve started, yet still it still has not sunk into my brain&#8230;. sigh.<br />
So what do I take away from all of this? Two things:</p>
<ol>
<li>Train my patience as a person so that it will not only impact my ability as a Go player, but the rest of my life as well.</li>
<li>Focus on the fundamentals of Go. Stay away from trying to do anything crazy until the basic are set and stone in my style of play.</li>
</ol>
