				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/09/thedivinemovemovie.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-5625" src="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/09/thedivinemovemovie-209x300.jpg?resize=209%2C300" alt="thedivinemovemovie" width="209" height="300" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><br />
When I first saw the trailer for this movie, there were two things that I noticed: go and martial arts. And as someone who grew up on kung fu movies and watching subtitled Asian movies, I was sold immediately.<br />
One of my concerns was that I would have to find some bootleg version of the movie online or wait forever to buy the DVD and have it shipped to the U.S. However, fortunately they had a limited theatrical release in the United States and one of the theaters was only about a 35 min drive away from me. Awesome!<br />
In case you’re planning on seeing it soon and don’t want to have any of my opinion impact your viewing of the movie, I will just say that I recommend you check it out. The only word of caution I would advise is for people who are squeamish about blood and violence. It’s not anything horrific or terribly gory (like a horror movie), but it’s certainly not completely sugar coated (like some martial art movies where the people never bleed or have injuries).<br />
If you’d like to hear a bit more opinionated review, read on!<br />
<span id="more-5624"></span><br />
So while I refuse to give away any plot details since I hate when people give spoilers, here’s what I will say about it.</p>
<ol>
<li>Overall, the movie had elements that reminded me of “The Count of Monte Cristo,” “Ocean’s 11,” and “Thai Warrior.”</li>
<li>I was worried that it would end up being an action movie with only a splash of go, but the theme of go was central to the entire movie and there was very few scenes where there were no references to go or some aspect of it.</li>
<li>My younger brother (who does not play go) really enjoyed it and even has some interest to learn some more about it now.</li>
</ol>
<p>In regards to the blood and violence, I will stress again that this movie is a bit more bloody and violent than I anticipated. In most martial arts movies (that I grew up watching), there was not much blood and blatant violence (like someone’s finger being broken while being tortured). However, it doesn’t even come close to what I’ve seen/heard about in horror movies in regards to gore and violence (i.e., there are no scenes of people’s heads getting sliced off or scenes of a person being gutted and the insides spewing out). In fact, the violence is used more as a means of showing the pain the characters are going through instead of for sheer gore factor.<br />
Overall, I had a great time watching the movie and enjoyed it. I’m sure that a movie connoisseur can pick the movie apart for X, Y, and Z reasons; but if you approach the movie as a story centered around go while having martial arts and showing some cultural insight into the gambling go scene in Korea, it should be an enjoyable watch.<br />
Definitely a movie I would recommend and one that I hope to add to my collection in the near future!</p>

<p>After my third game in Yunguseng Dojang, I became a lot more comfortable playing White. Maybe it&#8217;s because I&#8217;ve started to really appreciate having komi. Either way, I&#8217;m glad to have broken away from my fear of playing White.<br />
This game was the first one I played after being dispelled of that anxiety of playing White. And believe it or not, it was actually a rather calm game where no dramatic battles of life and death occurred. See for yourself below!<br />

1,Opening,<strong>Move 30</strong> &#8211; Using the knight’s move to gain sente from the 3-3 invasion was a big reason why I could get an advantage this game., Surprisingly I cannot find any fault with my opening. Please let me know if you spot something I missed!<br />
2,Middle Game,&#8221;Overall it was quite peaceful and neither played created any big weak groups, but I managed to take more territory overall.&#8221;, N/A<br />
3,Fighting,&#8221;To my surprise, there wasn’t much fighting in this game.”, N/A<br />
4,Endgame,<strong>Move 164-175</strong> &#8211; I was proud to find this sequence that reduced a lot of Black’s points in sente., Hard to find any big flaws in my endgame. It seemed I was stronger than my opponent in this area.<br />
5,Overall Reading,<strong>Move 100</strong> &#8211; Finding this preparatory move for the resulting sequence was a big step forward for me.,Move 52 &#8211; I completely missed the double atari when I played here. Shame on me.<br />
6,Strategy,<strong>Move 78</strong> &#8211; Realizing that it would be difficult to continue severely attacking the Black group and simply cashing in on territory is a move I used to find it impossible to do.,&#8221;<strong>Move 52</strong> &#8211; Even if we assume this move works, there wasn’t much strategic value here since White did not have great potential in the center nor a weak group to attack.&#8221;<br />

<p>This opponent was a unique one since he thought longer than I did and took his time. He actually ended up in byoyomi early on in the game and used most of his byoyomi time which is really weird for Tygem since most players I&#8217;ve encountered play pretty quickly and I&#8217;m the one usually running out of time. Overall though, I felt that I was in control for most of the game. Hopefully you&#8217;ll agree! And if I&#8217;m totally wrong, please let me know!<br />

no,Category,Good,Bad<br />
1,Opening,<strong>Move 9-11</strong>: Ignoring White in the upper left was good in that I did not unnecessarily strengthen my opponent by trying to struggle.,&#8221;Other than the inconsistency of Move 21, I don’t see any egregious errors in regards to the opening.&#8221;<br />
2,Middle Game,<strong>Move 39-63</strong>: It felt like I did a good job attacking White while gaining nice 4th line territory on the right.,Can’t see any major mistakes at the moment.<br />
3,Fighting,Overall the fighting seemed to be in my favor most of the game. Nothing terribly complicated.,Didn’t see any real weaknesses in my fighting this game.<br />
4,Endgame,<strong>Move 219</strong>: Ignoring White’s atari at M1 to make an extra point showed I was not making automatic moves and trying to look for bigger plays.,<strong>Move 164</strong>: Letting what get the diagonal here first was rough.<br />
5,Overall Reading,<strong>Move 121</strong>: I was proud to be able to read out this attachment and know it could not be cut without some loss to White.,<strong>Move 70</strong>: I could sense there was double cut aji here but failed to read it out properly.<br />
6,Strategy,<strong>Move 81</strong>: Sacrificing the F3 group in exchange for breaking up the left side seemed to show good judgment.,&#8221;<strong>Move 21</strong>: Though successful, the 3-3 invasion seems to be contrary to my initial plan at making a moyo. So negative points for inconsistency.&#8221;<br />

<p>Before this game, I had been getting white in most of my even games and had trouble playing properly. Games were often very rushed and I could hardly play a good game as White. However, after listening to Inseong talk about his views on playing White, I gave it a lot of thought and tried to get in a similar mindset.<br />
This game is the first game that I felt successful when playing White. Not only was my game not rushed and ill-conceived, but I felt like I was able to maintain control for most of the game. Hopefully you&#8217;ll agree! Enjoy the game.<br />

1,Opening,<strong>Move 20</strong> &#8211; I liked this extension in regards to the whole board since it seems like a proactive move., <strong>Move 9</strong> &#8211; I am unfamiliar with this position. Need to learn more about it in the future.<br />
2,Middle Game, <strong>Move 44</strong> &#8211; The cap started a sequence that allowed me to take the initiative in the middle game.,<strong>Move 104</strong> &#8211; Bad move that could have cost me the game.<br />
3,Fighting, <strong>Move 112</strong> &#8211; Ignoring Black to play here showed good fighting spirit., Can&#8217;t say that any of the fighting was bad for me this game. Correct me if I&#8217;m wrong though!<br />
4,Endgame, Not Applicable, Not Applicable<br />
5,Overall Reading, &#8220;<strong>Move 106</strong> &#8211; Though the reading is relatively simple, I was happy that I could read it out instantly with no doubt in my mind.&#8221;,<strong>Move 104</strong> &#8211; Worth mentioning twice. This was an overplay. I am lucky Black let me off the hook and made life instead.<br />

<p>I recently had a conversation regarding the importance of ladders. And while the topic of ladders will probably cause many people to roll their eyes at the topic time and time again, it&#8217;s simply one of those things that you keep having a deeper and deeper respect for as you dive into the abyss of go. Today&#8217;s game is short, but it illustrates the severity of not being able to perfectly read out a ladder.<br />
So whether you like it or not, you need to make your peace with ladders and make them your best friend. It&#8217;s the only way to climb to the top!<br />

1,Opening, <strong>Move 10</strong> &#8211; I&#8217;m proud of experimenting with a new joseki move I learned., <strong>Move 34</strong> &#8211; This seems questionable to me; but perhaps it was a necessary defense.<br />
2,Middle Game, <strong>Move 36</strong> &#8211; The sequence around here worked out really well in my favor., <strong>Move 52</strong> &#8211; This was rather small in regards to the whole board.<br />
3,Fighting, <strong>Move 48</strong> &#8211; My confidence in believing I could figure out the upper right corner was a good sign of healthy kiai., &#8220;<strong>Move 54</strong> &#8211; Though I was successful locally, this was small in regards to the whole board.&#8221;<br />
4,Endgame, Not Applicable, Not Applicable<br />
5,Overall Reading, <strong>Move 74</strong> &#8211; Being able to confidently read out this ladder was awesome., <strong>Move 58</strong> &#8211; The sequence around here didn&#8217;t quite work out the way I expected. Didn&#8217;t realize I needed a ladder to be able to really gain a foothold in this area.<br />

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 style="text-align: center;">Introduction</h2>
<p>Before playing this game, I had been studying one of Seo Bong Soo&#8217;s games from <a title="Book Review: The Fighting Styles of Kato Masao and Seo Bong Soo" href="//book-review-fighting-styles-kato-masao-seo-bong-soo/">Master Play: The Fighting Styles of Kato Masao and Seo Bong Soo</a>. And as I was replaying his game against Otake Hideo, I couldn&#8217;t help but wonder whether or not I had been wrong about my style of go this entire time. After all, I always thought I had a fighting style; but perhaps that is not really the case.<br />
Anyways, inspired by his game, I decided to try and imitate that same feeling in this game. And though I end up collapsing in on myself with a really basic reading mistake, I hope you&#8217;ll still find this game entertaining.<br />

1,Opening,Overall it felt okay considering it was a non-traditional opening; but nothing spectacular.,<strong>Move 28: </strong>This may have been too slow. Giving Black the initiative on the lower left was rough.<br />
2,Middle Game,It felt more or less in my favor; but a bit risky.,Black got a big left side which sort of forced me to try and kill his group.<br />
3,Fighting,<strong>Move 38:</strong> I was proud of starting this fight since I had an advantage in this area.,<strong>Move 98:</strong> This is probably my losing move. Letting my stones get weakened like that was bad.<br />
4,Endgame,Not Applicable,Not Applicable<br />
5,Overall Reading,<strong>Move 74-97:</strong> Felt proud for being able to continually harass this group / almost killing it.,<strong>Move 106:</strong> No excuses for this move. Complete misread.<br />

<p>And we&#8217;re back for the second week of Thursday Go Tygem! Unfortunately since the last game, I was demoted to 2d. No matter though! The opponents are still dans, so we march onwards!<br />
This game I take White against a 2d. The opening starts out with a terrible exchange on my part, and then a crazy fight for supremacy in the middle game breaks out after he makes a mistake in trying to cut apart my groups. Definitely a game that demonstrates how kiai (i.e., fighting spirit) can make a big difference in a position where you are initially at a disadvantage.<br />
As always, please let me know if there is anything I can do to improve this series for you guys!<br />

no,Category,Good,Bad<br />
1,Opening,<strong>Moves 44:</strong> Was proud to find this move to resist Black’s attempt to get an overwhelming advantage in the opening.,<strong>Move 18+:</strong> The push cut exchange made me over-concentrated and in bad position.<br />
2,Middle Game,Overall it felt like the middle game was in my favor and I outplayed my opponent.,<strong>Move 168:</strong> Avoiding the ko was so indescribably bad because there was no ko. *hangs head in shame* Could have been such an easy game&#8230;<br />
3,Fighting,<strong>Move 122+:</strong> I was quite proud to be able to fight on even grounds in such close proximity here.,<strong>Move 168:</strong> So shameful it gets restated twice. Just so bad.<br />
4,Endgame,<strong>Move 212:</strong> I was proud to find this attachment quickly to reduce Black’s area., Can’t say I was great at identifying the biggest value on the board; but tried to use sente/gote moves as my points of reference.<br />
5,Overall Reading,<strong>Move 80:</strong> Outreading Black by knowing the cut didn’t work was very satisfying.,<strong>Move 188:</strong> This should have been at R3 to make life in the corner and would have changed the result of the game.<br />

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 style="text-align: center;">Introduction</h2>
<p>Welcome to my new Thursday Go Tygem series! This series is inspired by fellow go blogger Eyecatcher&#8217;s <a title="Eyecatcher's WBaduk Series Intro" href="http://www.truthandgo.com/?p=442">WBaduk Challenge series</a> where he posts the games from WBaduk to keep himself disciplined and force himself to review his games from there as well. As you might have guessed from the title of this series, the games featured on here will solely be from Tygem.<br />
I&#8217;m sure some of you are wondering though, &#8220;What&#8217;s the difference between this and Monday Go Meditation?&#8221;</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Higher Level Commentaries</strong> &#8211; Instead of being extremely detailed with every move, this series focuses on higher level commentary that highlights big points and any key aspects of how I thought the game went. In addition, it will abstain from any detailed explanation regarding variations in order to save on time and effort. By doing this, I am hoping that this will help speed up my process (since reviewing all my games via Monday Go Meditation is practically impossible).</li>
<li><strong>Exclusively Dan Level Opponents</strong> &#8211;  The unique kicker to this entire series is that it will consist entirely of me playing dan players on Tygem. As some of you might remember, frozensoul once gave me the challenge to exclusively play dan players on Tygem in order to get stronger. Well, your wish is granted sensei. This series is the start of me embarking on that journey.</li>
</ol>
<p>And since this is a new series, it would be great if you could leave some feedback below to let me know whether or not I should continue with this series or if there are things I should do to improve it! Here we go!<br />

1,Opening,<strong>Moves 8-10</strong>: Ignoring White&#8217;s pincer to make my own enclosure and then diving in the corner felt like good timing overall.,<strong>Move 11</strong>: I messed up the lower left joseki due to carelessness.<br />
2,Middle Game,<strong>Move 45-49</strong>: I was really proud of this sequence since I could break up White&#8217;s area while counter attacking at the same time., <strong>Move 56</strong>: I feel I may have mishandled this crosscut fight and gave away too much to White as a result.<br />
3,Fighting,<strong>Move 158-160</strong>: I was proud of myself for not backing away from the ko fight., Nothing bad as far as I can tell.<br />
4,Endgame,My endgame felt average this game. Nothing special.,<strong>Move 134</strong>: Letting White get this hane was really painful.<br />
5,Overall Reading,Overall I think I did alright. Nothing I&#8217;m particularly proud of though., <strong>Move 100</strong>: Didn&#8217;t see that coming!<br />

<figure id="attachment_5198" style="width: 500px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/washingbadukopenpart2-01.png"><img class=" wp-image-5198" alt="washingbadukopenpart2-01" src="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/washingbadukopenpart2-01.png?resize=500%2C375" width="500" height="375" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Hikaru No Go, Kuwabara Hon’inbo (Epsiode 29)</figcaption></figure>
When I woke up the next day, I felt like a brand new person. I know that I could have been like a lot of other players who would have recalled the performance from the first day and felt sorry for themselves, but the the experience I had watching Park Sohyun (3p) play the night before had struck me and really opened my eyes.<br />
I was running a little late that morning, and ended up getting there around 9:35am. According to the schedule, I was already late and so I half-expected to find everyone already playing their games and my clock already running. However, it seemed like I wasn&#8217;t the only one running late because the pairings hadn&#8217;t even been put up when I arrived.<br />
After catching up with some people though, the roster was finally put up. As I scanned the list, I found my opponent: a 5 kyu. He would be taking Black and I was giving him no handicap.<br />
My opponent was 5 kyu and I wasn&#8217;t giving him a handicap. Had it been yesterday, I probably would have been frustrated that I was &#8220;demoted;&#8221; but I was past those stupid egotistical thoughts today.<br />
As I sat down in front of my opponent, I was very clear on what I was going to do: I was going to try and play like Sohyun did the night before. It was going to be strong and interesting go. That&#8217;s the go I would play. Below is the kifu. (The commentary version will be Monday Go Meditation: Game 63)<br />

<div id='glift_display8' style='height:500px; width:100%; position:relative;'></div>
<script type='text/javascript'>gliftWidget = glift.create({"divId":"glift_display8","sgf":"http:\/\/bengozen.com\/\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/04\/2014.04.27-WashingtonOpen-Round-4.sgf","display":{"theme":"DEFAULT","drawBoardCoords":"1"}});</script>

<p style="text-align: center;">[download label=&#8221;Download Kifu&#8221;]//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014.04.27-WashingtonOpen-Round-4.sgf[/download]
<p style="text-align: left;">It was an exciting game, but one that I felt far more in control of than any of the games previously. When my opponent resigned, I let out a sigh of relief. &#8220;Yes.&#8221; I thought, &#8220;At least I&#8217;m now 2-2. And to top it off, I&#8217;m feeling a hell of a lot better than yesterday.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">After Round 4, Myung Wan Kim (9p) and I grabbed our bento boxes (unfortunately I didn&#8217;t take a photo this time, but I got the <a title="Galbi Wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galbi">galbi</a> one) and I took him back to the hotel so he could rest / work on other things (since there was a few hours gap before he had to be back).</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">When I dropped him off, he asked me to pick him up around 3:10pm. So when I arrived back at the tournament, I looked at the time.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">&#8220;1:00pm is when Round 5 starts,&#8221; I thought, &#8220;And assuming my game takes even just the main time alone, I would be over time and late picking up Myung.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">With my record at 2-2, I seriously debated not playing in the 5th round and taking a buy. After all, 2-2 isn&#8217;t a bad record to end the tournament with right?</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">A good part of this was my insecurity at the prospects of possibly ending the tournament with a record of 2-3 and losing the final round, but I realized quickly that it was stupid. I decided to simply play in the 5th Round, and if push came to shove, I would resign the game if it took too long because I wanted to make sure I would pick up Myung on time.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Before I knew it, the fifth round pairings were up. My opponent was a 4 kyu that I knew from the area. There would be no handicap and I was taking white. Below are the results of the my final game for the tournament. (The commentary version will be Monday Go Meditation: Game 64)</p>

<div id='glift_display9' style='height:500px; width:100%; position:relative;'></div>
<script type='text/javascript'>gliftWidget = glift.create({"divId":"glift_display9","sgf":"http:\/\/bengozen.com\/\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/04\/2014.04.27-WashingtonOpen-Round-5.sgf","display":{"theme":"DEFAULT","drawBoardCoords":"1"}});</script>

<p>When the game was coming close to the end, time was also drawing near as well. It was around 2:30pm when I had begun my final hunt to kill the group on the top; but my opponent still had plenty of time left on his clock, so I couldn&#8217;t fault him for trying to take the time to make sure he was really dead. However, with time drawing close, I began mentally preparing myself to resign and simply be satisfied with the game that I had played.<br />
As you might imagine, I breathed a sigh of relief and thanked my lucky stars when he resigned. &#8220;Hoorah!&#8221; I thought, &#8221; I still can go pickup Myung with time to spare!&#8221; And with that, I went to report my results and went off to pick him up.<br />
When we got back, there was still some time to spare before the remaining festivities began (i.e., lecture and simul games). This was perfect however, because  I was able to spend some time talking with Sohyun (since she had been running in and out and busy with other obligations). We went over my game in Round 5, and I even got her to sign a book that she had given me the night before.<br />
<figure id="attachment_5206" style="width: 358px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/haengmaBook.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-5206" alt="haengmaBook" src="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/haengmaBook-768x1024.jpg?resize=358%2C477" width="358" height="477" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">It&#8217;s a Korean book on haengma (i.e., stone movement). Best souvenir from the event!</figcaption></figure>
As we wrapped up one of our conversations, a fellow Korean player had come by; so she had the idea to give both of us a simul game while we were waiting for everything to start (which was incredibly kind of her). I decided to play an even game with her since I wanted to feel the full power of her skills.<br />
Unfortunately we were only able to play about 20 or so moves before she was summoned to play the official simul games scheduled for the event. However, what I will say about the game was that even in that series of short exchanges, it was quite an experience to watch her start dismantling what I thought was a good position.<br />
With all the games finished, they had the following activities going on simultaneously:<br />
(1) Myung Wan Kim (9p) reviewing one of Andy Liu&#8217;s (1p) game from the tournament.<br />

After a couple of hours, the time finally came for the awards ceremony.<br />
The tournament was broken up into seven sections:</p>
<ol>
<li><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">Open Section (7d+)</span></li>
<li><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">Dan A (4-6d)</span></li>
<li><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">Dan B (1-3d)</span></li>
<li><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">Kyu A (1-5k)</span></li>
<li><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">Kyu B (6-10k)</span></li>
<li><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">Kyu C (11-15k)</span></li>
<li><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">Kyu D (16k+)</span></li>
</ol>
<p>When they announced the first place prize for the Kyu D division, &#8220;&#8230; 1st Place, trophy and $100&#8221; echoed over the microphone. As I heard the cash prize amount, I&#8217;d be lying if I said that part of me didn&#8217;t feel just a twinge of jealously as I heard the cash prize amount. After all, it wasn&#8217;t chump change by any stretch of the means!<br />
As I sat there listening to them announce the winners, I recalled the time that I had won first place in the <a title="NOVA Pumpkin Classic Tournament 2012 — Conclusion" href="//nova-pumpkin-classic-tournament-2012-conclusion/">Pumpkin Classic</a>. I smiled as I remembered that momentous feeling. And a small part of me wished that I had done better in the tournament; but then I reminded myself that I had nothing to be ashamed of for this tournament. After all, on top managing to bring my record up to 3-2, the experiences and the lessons that I had learned through this tournament were priceless and I would not have traded it in for a better record or any trophy or prize money.<br />
&#8220;Kyu A Division (1-5k),&#8221; echoed over the microphone.<br />
My attention returned to the present as I thought.  &#8220;Oo&#8230; I wonder who won my division.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>&#8212; let&#8217;s pause and let&#8217;s rewind the clock for a sec &#8212;</em></p>
<p>Earlier when I had been walking around, I had heard the tournament directors talking about how the kyu divisions did not have any people who won 4 games except for one person. (I later found out it was Bob Crites who had been performing well in tournaments recently.)<br />
A part of me became hopeful at that thought that maybe I was still in the running for something, but then I brushed the notion aside as I recalled that I had not exactly played my best consistently in the tournament.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>&#8212; return to present moment &#8212;</em></p>
<p>&#8220;3rd Place &#8211; Weixin Wang, 4k &#8211; $50 and a trophy&#8221;<br />
*applause and multiple cameras taking photos going off*<br />
&#8220;Huh,&#8221; I thought, &#8220;That&#8217;s the guy I lost to in the 3rd round. If he got third place, then I&#8217;m most definitely out of the running now.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;2nd Place &#8211; John Zhao, 3k &#8211; $100 and a trophy&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Wait,&#8221; I thought, &#8220;That&#8217;s the guy I beat in the 1st round. Maybe I still have a shot?&#8221;<br />
As I&#8217;m sitting there bewildered and trying to make sense of how the tiebreakers might actually work, the microphone echoes again:<br />
&#8220;1st Place &#8211; Benjamin Hong&#8230;&#8221;<br />

I honestly wish someone had taken a picture of my face, because I can tell you that I was completely and utterly surprised. But yeah, I wasn&#8217;t hallucinating or imaging things. I really did get 1st place.<br />
<figure style="width: 448px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/05/2014-WOpen-22.jpg"><img class=" " alt="2014-WOpen-22" src="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/05/2014-WOpen-22.jpg?resize=448%2C298" width="448" height="298" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">There&#8217;s my first prize envelope.

The thing about tournaments is that you never know what&#8217;s going to happen. I went the first day with a 1-2 record and completely thought I was out of the running. In fact, I even thought about dropping out the last round because of stupid insecurities. Imagine if I had done that? Imagine if I had just given up? The story would not have been nearly as exciting would it?<br />
Though I am very grateful that I got 1st place, I really believe that this tournament will forever go down as one of the pinnacle moments in my journey as a go player. The experiences and things that I learned about myself through the trials and tribulations are ones that I will forever remember fondly and I look forward to continue building on them.<br />
Many thanks also goes out to Keith, Gary, Andy, Todd, Alan, the Korean Baduk Association and many others for making this tournament a huge success. And of course, special thanks goes out to <a title="SmartGo Official Site" href="https://www.smartgo.com/">SmartGo</a> for its awesome iPad app that serves as my trusty sidekick for recording my games.<br />
Finally, a huge thanks goes out to Myung Wan Kim (9p) and Park Sohyun (3p) for making this tournament an unforgettable experience and providing guidance when I really needed it!</p>
