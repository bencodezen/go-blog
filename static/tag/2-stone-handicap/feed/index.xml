				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>For this week&#8217;s go meditation, I am featuring my game from the Pumpkin Classic that I had the pleasure of visiting for a round. This game was an interesting challenge for me since it had been a while since I had played a game in person, let alone play a handicap game. As this is a handicap game where I play White, I hope that my thoughts throughout the game will help you understand better why players sometimes make the moves they do in handicap games. Enjoy!<br />

<h2>One Point Lesson</h2>
<p>When playing as White in a two stone handicap game, don’t try to complicate the game too early. If your opponent punishes your overplays early on, you will have a hard time coming back</p>

This past weekend I had the pleasure of attending the NOVA Pumpkin Classic Tournament and seeing many friends there. And though I originally planned on playing in the tournament that day, I ended up being on call for work and thus planned on only attending to see friends and show my support.<br />
Upon arrival though, I got convinced to play in the first round since we had even numbers. And while I would have liked to have played for more rounds, it was simply not possible for me to do so with a possible work call coming at any moment.<br />
On the upside, I did get to play a round against an opponent I had played against in the Baduk Open Championship. I had decided to self-promote to 1k this time and was giving her a 2 stone handicap. The following is the game record (which I will be sure to review in a future Monday Go Meditation).<br />

<p>Though I am a little sad I was not able to stay for the whole day, it was great being able to see everyone. An especially big shoutout goes to the Stafford Go community: Robbie, Anderson, and Ramon for being there and sharing a great lunch with me.<br />
Other than that, I’ve been adhering to my training schedule without fail thus far. And though I had some initial plans for ramping up content production here on the blog, it’ll have to wait a bit as I am in the process of sorting through things. No worries though, you can still expect to see the usual here. Just don’t expect any new weekly columns in the near future. Haha.<br />
With that said, for all those who celebrate Halloween, wishing you all a spectacular Halloween full of fun and candy!</p>

<p>And the funny thing is that this trend seems to be consistent with other things I tried to switch my attention to momentarily (like League of Legends). Part of me wonders whether I&#8217;ve acquired some sort of &#8220;losing&#8221; mindset; but on second though, it&#8217;s rather unlikely since I know that starting off any game being like &#8220;I&#8217;m going to lose anyways&#8221; is a recipe for disaster.<br />
As this is the first day in my quest to return back to my origins, I shouldn&#8217;t be surprised that things are not much different than yesterday. There&#8217;s a big mix of frustration, loss, and clarity all at the time. And to be honest, it feels as if stumbling through the dark blindly reaching for anything I can hold on to to feel like I&#8217;m making progress. I have no idea if it&#8217;s going to get me where I want to go, but it certainly seems to beat standing still.<br />
On the bright side, I&#8217;m glad I&#8217;m not gambling any time soon.</p>
