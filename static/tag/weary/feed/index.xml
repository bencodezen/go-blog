				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Lately, I&#8217;ve noticed that I can&#8217;t seem to get my head in the game. Each move feels more lackluster than the last, and I seem to consistently find myself in do or die situations. I don&#8217;t know if it&#8217;s because I&#8217;m tired, or whether I&#8217;m actually starting to burn out.<br />
With each move I play, it&#8217;s as if I&#8217;m watching a ghost of myself play each move. The tenacity and energy that was once a big part of my game seems to be missing. Unlike other times, there is no obstacle in my way this time. Instead, it is like I am a weary traveler who has succeeded in one part of his journey; but as he stares out at the long road ahead, he can only sit down in bewilderment as he wonders how he will summon the energy necessary to continue onwards.<br />
Taking a break is not an option for me. That is something I know for sure, but figuring out how I will continue from here will certainly be a challenge.</p>
