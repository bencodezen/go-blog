				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 style="text-align: center;">Introduction</h2>
<p>For this week&#8217;s meditation, I am featuring the first game I played after coming back from Hong Kong. It had been awhile since I last played, so I was feeling a little nervous about playing poorly. Fortunately for me though, my opponent accepted my challenge before I could chicken out and cancel my challenge.<br />
If there&#8217;s one thing I will say about this game though, it is that I was spending a lot less time second guessing myself regarding my reading. Definitely have the trip to thank for that. This game was certainly a testament to how your reading abilities allow you to make better moves easily since it takes much less effort to read out the variations. Thank you once again Hong Kong trip.<br />
Finally, this game&#8217;s play style was inspired by my sensei who told me one way to play is to simply ignore your opponent and play what you want. Obviously this should not be taken literally, but you&#8217;ll see how it influences this game. Hope that you&#8217;ll enjoy this crazy game full of fighting and an opponent who makes the most outrageous overplays in hopes that I will make an epic mistake!<br />

<p style="text-align: center;">The only antidote to an opponent who makes overplays in hopes you&#8217;ll make a mistake is reading.</p>

[expand title=&#8221;Before I Read This Book&#8230;&#8221; trigclass=&#8221;expandTitle&#8221;]
As an enthusiast of the &#8220;Graded Go Problems for Beginners&#8221; series, I have to say that I was ecstatic when I heard about this series. After all, every kyu player dreams of making it to the big dan league and being able to solve &#8220;dan level&#8221; problems. And even though I got myself a copy of this book quite a while ago, this book seemed quite daunting to me for some time due to the fact that I just felt I wasn&#8217;t ready for &#8220;dan&#8221; problems. Anyhow, I&#8217;m glad I finally got around to reading it so that you can hear my thoughts on the book itself.<br />
[/expand]
[expand title=&#8221;My Review&#8221; trigclass=&#8221;expandTitle&#8221; expanded=&#8221;true&#8221;]
Perhaps my favorite aspect about the entire &#8220;Graded Go Problems&#8221; series as a whole is the extremely clean format. For those who don&#8217;t know what I&#8217;m talking about, every page that contains the problems is divided into four clean and even rectangles. Secondly, the numbering, diagram, directions, and even hints are all in universal places so that once you get exposed to the format, you&#8217;ll never wonder where to look next. And last but not least, the solutions are never exposed on the same page (aka you can&#8217;t see the solution as you&#8217;re trying to solve the problem). And thankfully, Graded Go Problems for Dan Players continues that tradition.<br />
One of the new things I noticed with this series is that they added an actual rank estimation for the problem difficulty. So a few examples of this might include: &#8220;Solve at a glance = 4-kyu, Solve within five minutes = 3-dan, etc.&#8221; While this is rather neat since you feel a sense of accomplishment if you&#8217;re able to solve it within the allotted time-frame, it&#8217;s important to realize that these rank estimations are a bit arbitrary. Just because you&#8217;re able to solve a few dan level problems at a glance does not necessarily mean you are &#8220;dan&#8221; level (whether it&#8217;s reading ability or playing ability). If you&#8217;re able to solve the whole book at a glance though, then it goes without saying you are way stronger than a dan player. xD<br />
When it comes to the solutions, they have a set standard format for how solutions are displayed and approached. In terms of basic format, every problem gets three solution diagrams. This generally includes the correct variation, an alternate variation / continuation of the correct variation, and an incorrect variation. In addition, there is usually at least a sentence to two explaining each of the variations in order to help the reader understand what&#8217;s going on.<br />
If there were to be any complaint about this series, it would probably be that the problems are not segmented into different techniques. However, I would remind the reader that the purpose of this series is to provide a collection of high-quality problems. As a result, the problems would be an assortment of different problems as opposed to a hierarchy of problems broken down by techniques. If you&#8217;re looking for problems categorized in such a fashion, you might benefit from checking out the Level Up Series along with Life and Death Problems 1 Basics by Robert Jasiek.<br />
Overall, I think that this series is destined for the same greatness as the &#8220;Graded for Go Problems for Beginners&#8221; when it comes to high quality problems that are displayed in an easy to read format. Definitely a must-have for any player serious about practicing their reading and looking for ways to keep honing their ability. Highly recommended!<br />

<strong>My Abilities</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>I&#8217;ve studied my fair share of life and death and can confidently say that I have a SDK (single digit kyu) level of life and death.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>My Perspective</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>In general, I would say that I have always preferred learning through experience. Though in all honesty, after finishing the second volume, I was skeptical of how far I could really get in this book.</li>
</ul>
[/expand]
[expand title=&#8221;My Review&#8221; trigclass=&#8221;expandTitle&#8221; expanded=&#8221;true&#8221;]
<strong>What did I enjoy about the book?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Though my inability to progress very far was slightly depressing, I was happy to see that there was still a lot of room for me to grow and improve my life and death skills.</li>
<li>The drill seargent routine is great because I have multiple opportunities to get exposure to moves I would have never considered before.</li>
<li>There is a huge focus on shapes that players don&#8217;t normally study: rectangular six and 2-2-2. In addition, these shapes are dissected to a very detailed level. Example: Rectangular six with one outside liberty versus two liberties.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What did I gain from reading this book?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A broader perspective on the different variations that can arise from life and death postiions.</li>
<li>A better grasp on techniques used to either kill or save a group.</li>
<li>Moderate improvement in my reading abilities. (This is only due to the speed at which I was going through problems. Anyone who diligently studies each problem to mastery will most likely gain a significant boost to their reading ability).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What style of teaching does the book use?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Curriculum Style
<ul>
<li>Content is organized into lessons, topics, or themes in order to facilitate learning.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Teaching Mechanism:
<ul>
<li>Practice problems</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What aspect can be improved on?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>I felt that the problems got a lot more difficult very quickly. However, this should be taken with a grain of salt since there is a good chance that the reader is supposed to already have a more solid reading ability than I have before working on this book.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Is this book easy to read?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Yes. Unless you can&#8217;t read English, it really doesn&#8217;t get any simpler.</li>

Compared to <a title="Book Review: 1001 Life and Death Problems" href="//book-review-1001-life-and-death-problems/">1001 Life and Death Problems</a>, this series does a better job hand-holing players new to life and death through the basic shapes and variations. On the other hand, I would say that in terms of polishing a player&#8217;s life and death skills, 1001 Life and Death Problems is still highly recommended. So to clarify, neither one trumps the other. Both can provide great value to a player&#8217;s life and death abilities.<br />

<li>You can expect the same quality of problems from the first volume.</li>

<li>Though I had a relatively easy time with the first volume, the problems in this book started to pose some difficulty for me.</li>

[expand title=&#8221;Before I Read This Book&#8230;&#8221; trigclass=&#8221;expandTitle&#8221;]
<strong>My Abilities</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>I&#8217;ve studied my fair share of life and death and can confidently say that I have a SDK (single digit kyu) level of life and death.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>My Perspective</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>After finishing the first volume, I was expecting this book to be rather easy to do as well.</li>
</ul>

[expand title=&#8221;My Review&#8221; trigclass=&#8221;expandTitle&#8221; expanded=&#8221;true&#8221;]
<strong>What did I enjoy about the book?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>They have no reservation in terms of making you drill the same concept repeatedly.</li>
<li>There are so many concepts and shapes in this book that makes it very valuable.</li>
<li>The review sections (e.g., quizzes) and tests do a great job helping you determine if you actually learned the lessons prior.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What did I gain from reading this book?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A broader perspective on the different variations that can arise from life and death postiions.</li>
<li>A better grasp on techniques used to either kill or save a group.</li>
<li>The problems in this book actually posed some difficulty for me at times. Being that this is the second book, it didn&#8217;t take long for me to realize how weak my life and death skills really are.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What style of teaching does the book use?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Curriculum Style
<ul>
<li>Content is organized into lessons, topics, or themes in order to facilitate learning.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Teaching Mechanism:
<ul>
<li>Practice problems</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What aspect can be improved on?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>If I had to request one thing, it&#8217;s that I was hoping that the difficulty of the problems would be more gradual. The difficulty of the problems increased faster than I was expecting. Though this should be taken with a grain of salt since I have a feeling this is just an indicator of how weak my reading abilities are instead of it being the book&#8217;s problem.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Is this book easy to read?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Yes. Unless you can&#8217;t read English, it really doesn&#8217;t get any simpler.</li>

Compared to <a title="Book Review: 1001 Life and Death Problems" href="//book-review-1001-life-and-death-problems/">1001 Life and Death Problems</a>, this series does a better job hand-holing players new to life and death through the basic shapes and variations. On the other hand, I would say that in terms of polishing a player&#8217;s life and death skills, 1001 Life and Death Problems is still highly recommended. So to clarify, neither one trumps the other. Both can provide great value to a player&#8217;s life and death abilities.<br />

Though they may overlap on a good deal of material, I believe that they complement one another and would both be of great use to serious players wanting to improve their life and death.<br />

<strong>My Abilities</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Having worked through other life and death books, I am confident enough to say that I have a SDK (single digit kyu) understanding of life and death.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>My Perspective</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>I was looking forward to getting exposed to a lot of basic life and death shapes. In addition, I was hoping to get a bit of practice on the different shapes so I could be a lot more confident on my life and death abilities when I finished the book.</li>
</ul>
[/expand]
[expand title=&#8221;My Review&#8221; trigclass=&#8221;expandTitle&#8221; expanded=&#8221;true&#8221;]
<strong>What did I enjoy about the book?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>There are so many shapes that you get to learn about!</li>
<li>On top of that, these shapes are ones that actually occur quite frequently in games! Case and point, I actually ran into a J shape soon after I finished the book.</li>
<li>There are a lot of &#8220;what is the status of this group&#8221; problems.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What did I gain from reading this book?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Exposure to a lot of new shapes that I never even considered life and death shapes in the past.</li>
<li>Better understanding of the weaknesses in various shapes.</li>
<li>New ideas regarding how the opponent would/should actually respond in certain life and death scenarios.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What style of teaching does the book use?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Textbook Approach
<ul>
<li>Organized in a curriculum format that reflects the learning style one might normally find in school.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Primary Learning Mechanism:
<ul>
<li>Explanations with example diagrams</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Other Learning Mechanisms:
<ul>
<li>Practice problems</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What aspect can be improved on?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Though the fact that it uses &#8220;what is the status of this group&#8221; problems is a good thing for the most part, I feel that this is counter-productive to anyone learning life and death for the first time since status problems can actually be rather difficult for players who are not accustomed to reading multiple rather complex variations in life and death situations.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Is this book easy to read?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Yes. Davies&#8217; writing style is easy to understand and his conversational style makes for a fun read. In addition, almost every diagram is accompanied by a short line or paragraph explaining the position.</li>

<a title="Book Review: 1001 Life and Death Problems" href="//book-review-1001-life-and-death-problems/">1001 Life and Death Problems</a> is much more appropriate for players looking for an introduction to life and go.

[expandsub2 title=&#8221;Essential Life &amp; Death Series&#8221; trigclass=&#8221;cBookTitle&#8221;]
