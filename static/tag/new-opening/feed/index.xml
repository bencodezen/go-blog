				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: left;">As a game progresses over time, it is very easy to lose track of the connections between your groups. After all, if you&#8217;re intently staring at the board for a long time, it&#8217;s not so far fetched to start seeing groups being connected when in fact they aren&#8217;t. In fact, if you take a quick look at the kifu snapshot above, it would seem that the top black group is doing alright. Unfortunately, nothing could be further from the truth.</p>
<p><span id="more-7"></span><br />
While I&#8217;ve played a number of games recently where either I or my opponent failed to keep track of our connections, the kifu for today&#8217;s game is one that demonstrates this concept very well. As you go over the kifu, you&#8217;ll notice that for the most part, Black has done a pretty good job keeping all of his groups connected. As a result, White had to be careful about his own connections and determining whether a cut will actually work or not. Unfortunately for Black, the game progressed to a point where he got so caught up in the running battle that he failed to realize that White was aiming to disconnect his group the entire time.<br />
<strong>Remember, it&#8217;s critical that you are never lulled into a false sense of security at any point during the game</strong>. It is precisely during these times that the opponent will find the game changing move to turn the game in his/her favor.<br />
To help you avoid the false sense of security, always be sure to check on the following whenever your opponent makes a move:</p>
<ol>
<li>Are my groups alive?</li>
<li>Are my groups connected at the key locations? Or in another sense, is it easy for my opponent to cut my groups apart and get away with it?</li>
</ol>
<div>If you can answer those questions with confidence, then it is irrelevant whether your reading abilities fall short. You did the basic steps of being sensitive to your stones. The mistakes will come, and you will learn from it. By following this path, you will inevitably get stronger.</div>
<div></div>
<div>And as always, if your groups are fine, the fun part comes when seeing whether or not your opponent&#8217;s groups are prime for attack and even death.</div>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This will be my only game for today. It was played pretty poorly in my opinion. That&#8217;s what I get for playing first thing in the morning I guess. The fun part is that I got to play an opponent that I had played before on my zenix account. At the time, he was 16k and I was 19k, and I managed to win by 30 points! Needless to say, I was excited at the prospect of being able to play with him again on equal grounds!<br />
<span id="more-62"></span><br />
This game was interesting because it&#8217;s the first time my opponent chose the opposing corners for the opening. Granted, I&#8217;m not strong enough to really understand the implications of such a game, but it certainly surprised me. Compared to last time though, not such a big win. My opponent made some careless errors, and I happened to read out a couple things better than him that allowed me to win the game. Otherwise though, I really think I played awfully.<br />
Check out the game record below and let me know your thoughts!<br />
