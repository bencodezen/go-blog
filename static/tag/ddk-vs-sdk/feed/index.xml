So I was thinking it over, and at first I wasn&#8217;t going to put up some of my recent games due to the fact that they are utterly miserable. But, I think it&#8217;ll actually be good for those who are at the DDK range and feeling frustrated with their own games when they are obliterated. Here is a game I played against someone who was also 12k, and I think this is like one of VERY few games where I lost to someone lower than 10k while I was 12k. I thought I was doing well, but clearly I did not.<br />

<script type='text/javascript'>gliftWidget = glift.create({"divId":"glift_display1","sgf":"http:\/\/bengozen.com\/\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/11\/2010.11.04-Failed-Games.sgf","display":{"theme":"DEFAULT","drawBoardCoords":"1"}});</script>

Also, I had the pleasure of talking to Jaddie (one of the 10k opponents who destroyed me). We went over one of his games and I was fascinated to see some sequences that frankly would not have occurred to me. To the stronger players, yes I realize I&#8217;m only 12k. But still, it was cool. Jaddie also brings up the idea that DDK&#8217;s cannot see the whole board as well as SDK&#8217;s do. I definitely think he has a valid point there. Another point that I think that separates SDK&#8217;s and DDK&#8217;s is simple reading ability. Sigh&#8230; more on this when I figure it out.<br />
Oh, and in addition, apparently he doesn&#8217;t do any Go studying. &gt;.&lt; He said most of his experience comes from playing games. Man&#8230; maybe I&#8217;m just super untalented. It&#8217;s almost been three months and I&#8217;ve studied and I&#8217;m only at 12k on KGS&#8230; sigh. Oh well&#8230; no sense worrying about it. Let&#8217;s see where my strength and hard work take me. After all, they say the sky is the limit, yet why are there footprints on the moon?

Here&#8217;s a game that I wanted to put in my article on <a title="Bad vs. Wrong Decisions" href="//bad-vs-wrong-decisions/" target="_blank">Bad vs. Wrong Decisions</a>. Although this was a game against a 14k (I was 13k at the time), I gave it my all and I must say it was quite a match. (I&#8217;m white)So this is something I&#8217;ve definitely noticed. For some reason, there seems to exist this seemingly large gap between those who are SDK and those who are DDK. Now I know you&#8217;re probably like, imagine the gap between SDK and amateur dan, and then the gap between amateur dan and professionals! Trust me, I was quite aware of the barriers awaiting me when I began learning this game. It&#8217;s definitely interesting though, the way SDK&#8217;s play vs. DDK&#8217;s. At this point, if I&#8217;m matched up to a DDK, I think I&#8217;m in pretty solid shape. On the other hand&#8230; it doesn&#8217;t seem like I&#8217;m quite ready to take on an SDK yet (even game that is). I played an SDK last night in person, and lost by ~13 points even though I had a 3 stone handicap&#8230; bleh&#8230;. When I figure out where that gap is though, I&#8217;ll be sure to let you know.<br />
