				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>For this week&#8217;s go meditation, I am featuring my game from the Pumpkin Classic that I had the pleasure of visiting for a round. This game was an interesting challenge for me since it had been a while since I had played a game in person, let alone play a handicap game. As this is a handicap game where I play White, I hope that my thoughts throughout the game will help you understand better why players sometimes make the moves they do in handicap games. Enjoy!<br />

<h2>One Point Lesson</h2>
<p>When playing as White in a two stone handicap game, don’t try to complicate the game too early. If your opponent punishes your overplays early on, you will have a hard time coming back</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>In today&#8217;s go meditation, I am glad to welcome back fellow friend and go player Bonscott. For those who don&#8217;t remember, I&#8217;ve played a number of even games against Bonscott (even though there is a few stones difference between our ranks) and actually lost quite a few of them before. So when he challenged me to a game recently, I made sure to not underestimate him!<br />
In terms of the game, you&#8217;ll get to see the rather uncommon 3-3 opening. In addition, this is a good game for study in regards to the importance of selecting the correct strategy in conjunction with your opening moves. As you progress through the game, you will notice that Black&#8217;s attempt to shift from territorial to moyo and how it results in a difficult uphill battle for Black.<br />
Finally, in light of Halloween last Friday, I’ve included a fun life and death problem with a pretty detailed variations at the end of the game. Hope that you enjoy this game!<br />

This past weekend I had the pleasure of attending the NOVA Pumpkin Classic Tournament and seeing many friends there. And though I originally planned on playing in the tournament that day, I ended up being on call for work and thus planned on only attending to see friends and show my support.<br />
Upon arrival though, I got convinced to play in the first round since we had even numbers. And while I would have liked to have played for more rounds, it was simply not possible for me to do so with a possible work call coming at any moment.<br />
On the upside, I did get to play a round against an opponent I had played against in the Baduk Open Championship. I had decided to self-promote to 1k this time and was giving her a 2 stone handicap. The following is the game record (which I will be sure to review in a future Monday Go Meditation).<br />

<p>Though I am a little sad I was not able to stay for the whole day, it was great being able to see everyone. An especially big shoutout goes to the Stafford Go community: Robbie, Anderson, and Ramon for being there and sharing a great lunch with me.<br />
Other than that, I’ve been adhering to my training schedule without fail thus far. And though I had some initial plans for ramping up content production here on the blog, it’ll have to wait a bit as I am in the process of sorting through things. No worries though, you can still expect to see the usual here. Just don’t expect any new weekly columns in the near future. Haha.<br />
With that said, for all those who celebrate Halloween, wishing you all a spectacular Halloween full of fun and candy!</p>

<p>As the weeks have passed, one of the major factors in me starting to play go again has been the numerous friends who have been kind enough to take time out of their day and ask me to play. Just like last week’s MGM, this week’s MGM features teafree. It’s an exciting one that is chocked full of ko battles and exciting exchanges. I hope that it keeps you on the edge of your seat as we navigate through the treacherous waters of this kifu! Enjoy!<br />

1,Opening, Move 40 &#8211; I like this move since it was dual purpose as reinforcement and an extension.,&#8221;Move 10 &#8211; Though some might say that White ended up okay, I really did not like the result for White.&#8221;<br />
2,Attack and Defense, Nothing worth mentioning., Move 22 &#8211; Neglecting my corner for this pincer is questionable.<br />
3,Shape, N/A, Move 251 &#8211; I did not anticipate the ko shape here.<br />
4,Strategy, Move 146 &#8211; I was proud of being able to switch strategies once I realized my mistake., Move 92 &#8211; This was too greedy on my part and helped Black more than White.<br />
5,Overall Reading, Move 60 &#8211; Being able to discern this move out during the game gave me the advantage early on., Move 210 &#8211; Should have realized Black was already dead.<br />
6,Endgame, Move 262-264 &#8211; This was a nice sequence to capture a bigger corner., Move 286 &#8211; This was a useless connection.<br />

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 id="introduction" style="text-align: center;">Introduction</h2>
<p>Contrary to what I said last week, this week’s Monday Go Meditation features my Yunguseng Dojang game from last week. The reason for this is two-fold: (1) I didn’t play any other games over the past two weeks and (2) I’m still trying to keep MGM as current as possible.<br />
As I mentioned before, I was feeling rather iffy before this game. My opponent was around 4–5k in strenghth, and with my ups and downs lately, I wasn’t so sure that I could even beat him. But before I could wallow too much in my own insecurities, the game started.<br />
<em>Note: Similar to the other YSD match I posted last week, any specific things I learned from the review will be omitted in this game to respect other members’ paid membership.</em><br />

1,Opening,<strong>Move 10</strong> &#8211; This is not so much a good move as it is a move I’m proud of because it showed kiai on my part to be willing to compete with Black on a moyo game.,&#8221;<strong>Move 18</strong> &#8211; Though this moved seemed nice at the time, it was not very effective in terms of the whole board.&#8221;<br />
2,Attack and Defense,<strong>Move 44</strong> &#8211; The fact that I was able to take a step back to defend my group first before overextending my attack was a sign of progress for me.,<strong>Move 72</strong> &#8211; Trying to invade to attack the Black group was a bad attack.<br />
3,Shape,<strong>Move 162</strong> &#8211; Recognizing this clamp instantly was a nice moment for me since it meant I was increasing my repertoire of techniques to use.,<strong>Move 108</strong> &#8211; This doesn’t really defend my corner and makes bad shape.<br />
4,Strategy,<strong>Move 148</strong> &#8211; Sacrificing my four stones to push and cut here is one of the key moves that allowed me to secure my win.,<strong>Move 62</strong> &#8211; This peep and following sequence to take the corner was too small strategically.<br />
5,Overall Reading,<strong>Move 208</strong> &#8211; Reading out Black’s subsequent atari and seeing how it played out was a pretty big moment for me even though I missed the killing move at the end.,<strong>Move 82</strong> &#8211; The following sequence was just awful for me. Complete misread.<br />
6,Endgame,&#8221;<strong>Move 120</strong> &#8211; Though this move was an overplay, the idea of taking sente instead of responding to Black was good.&#8221;,<strong>Move 86</strong> &#8211; Blocking here instead of defending my bottom group nearly allowed my opponent to reverse the game in his favor.<br />

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Introduction</strong></h2>
<p>This week marks the reboot of the Monday Go Meditation (MGM) series! In the spirit of continuous improvement, I felt it was time to give this series an upgrade in order to continue striving for the perfect weekly column for my game reviews. Here are some enhancements that I have made:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>All MGM&#8217;s will now include the game summary table. </strong>After doing the <a title="Thursday Go Tygem: Game 07" href="//thursday-go-tygem-game-07/">Thursday Go Tygem</a> series for a bit, it seemed that the table was a popular aspect of it since it allowed me to provide a broad overview of the game in the event you don&#8217;t have time to go through the entire game. As a result, I felt it would be a great addition to MGM.</li>
<li>A<strong>ll games featured here will be 2 weeks old at the most.</strong> One thing I noticed is that the games being posted were starting to be a few weeks if not a month old, which is not good since it does not reflect my current progress as a player. Though this makes it a little harder for me since I can&#8217;t prepare as many game reviews in advance, I am confident this change will make this weekly column much more viable.</li>
<li><strong>The commentary will also be taking on a more &#8220;stream of consciousness&#8221; type narrative</strong> in order to provide more context in terms of how I was feeling throughout the game and the emotions and thoughts I wrestled with. As a result, the game reviews will not be heavily focused on explaining things in depth or showing numerous variations since that is more of a teaching-oriented type review (which I do plan on featuring here in the future, but don&#8217;t feel it&#8217;s appropriate for MGM).</li>
</ol>
<p>So in light of all that, this week&#8217;s game features an even game against a 3k that I played last week before going on my losing streak. Haha. It&#8217;s a great game that illustrates how emotions can really cloud your judgment when it comes to the actual board position and how you&#8217;re really doing.<br />
As always, it would be greatly appreciated if you could let me know what you think about these new changes. Hope you enjoy the review!<br />

1,Opening, <strong>Move 24:</strong> This move really gave me a nice advantage in the opening. See game commentary for a more in-depth explanations., <strong>Move 19:</strong> I’m not sure that I handled Black’s response here correctly. Perhaps the tenuki was a mistake.<br />
2,Attack and Defense, <strong>Move 50:</strong> This diagonal jump was a new move I tried that seemed to do a great job keeping pressure on Black., <strong>Move 58:</strong> This move was too defensive and failed to keep pressure on Black.<br />
3,Shape, Nothing worth mentioning., <strong>Move 64:</strong> Not connecting and letting Black push through to connect his groups together was a travesty.~~<strong>Move 52:</strong> The hane was bad and left too many cutting points for me to worry about later.<br />
4,Strategy, <strong>Move 44:</strong> Leaving the cutting point to play continue my expansion of the top seemed to work out well overall., <strong>Move 86-88:</strong> The push and cut was a risky play since Black had a number of forcing moves to counter the strategy.<br />
5,Overall Reading, Nothing to brag about since most sequences I read out usually had one fatal flaw that was luckily overlooked by my opponent., <strong>Move 76-85:</strong> This sequence was shameful since it was a result of wishful thinking and only made things worse.<br />
6,Endgame, <strong>Move 120:</strong> Ignoring Black’s move to start my own endgame sequence was a proud moment for me.,<strong> Move 104:</strong> This jump may not be as big as I thought. Perhaps blocking at M2 would have been better.<br />

<p>After my third game in Yunguseng Dojang, I became a lot more comfortable playing White. Maybe it&#8217;s because I&#8217;ve started to really appreciate having komi. Either way, I&#8217;m glad to have broken away from my fear of playing White.<br />
This game was the first one I played after being dispelled of that anxiety of playing White. And believe it or not, it was actually a rather calm game where no dramatic battles of life and death occurred. See for yourself below!<br />

no,Category,Good,Bad<br />
1,Opening,<strong>Move 30</strong> &#8211; Using the knight’s move to gain sente from the 3-3 invasion was a big reason why I could get an advantage this game., Surprisingly I cannot find any fault with my opening. Please let me know if you spot something I missed!<br />
2,Middle Game,&#8221;Overall it was quite peaceful and neither played created any big weak groups, but I managed to take more territory overall.&#8221;, N/A<br />
3,Fighting,&#8221;To my surprise, there wasn’t much fighting in this game.”, N/A<br />
4,Endgame,<strong>Move 164-175</strong> &#8211; I was proud to find this sequence that reduced a lot of Black’s points in sente., Hard to find any big flaws in my endgame. It seemed I was stronger than my opponent in this area.<br />
5,Overall Reading,<strong>Move 100</strong> &#8211; Finding this preparatory move for the resulting sequence was a big step forward for me.,Move 52 &#8211; I completely missed the double atari when I played here. Shame on me.<br />
6,Strategy,<strong>Move 78</strong> &#8211; Realizing that it would be difficult to continue severely attacking the Black group and simply cashing in on territory is a move I used to find it impossible to do.,&#8221;<strong>Move 52</strong> &#8211; Even if we assume this move works, there wasn’t much strategic value here since White did not have great potential in the center nor a weak group to attack.&#8221;<br />

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 style="text-align: center;">Introduction</h2>
<p>With this week, we continue on with Game #2 of Maaike&#8217;s <a title="Maaike's April Challenge" href="http://www.thegochallenge.blogspot.com.au/2014/04/april-challenge.html">April Challenge</a>! Even though the game ended up culminating into a rather large capturing race, I felt that my decisions leading up to it were calm as a whole. Instead of trying to turn it into a capturing race from the beginning, there were a number of times when I would offer the possibility of a peaceful resolution. So in that regard, I believe that I was successful in playing a calm game. Hopefully you&#8217;ll think so too!<br />

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 style="text-align: center;">Introduction</h2>
<p>Before playing this game, I had been studying one of Seo Bong Soo&#8217;s games from <a title="Book Review: The Fighting Styles of Kato Masao and Seo Bong Soo" href="//book-review-fighting-styles-kato-masao-seo-bong-soo/">Master Play: The Fighting Styles of Kato Masao and Seo Bong Soo</a>. And as I was replaying his game against Otake Hideo, I couldn&#8217;t help but wonder whether or not I had been wrong about my style of go this entire time. After all, I always thought I had a fighting style; but perhaps that is not really the case.<br />
Anyways, inspired by his game, I decided to try and imitate that same feeling in this game. And though I end up collapsing in on myself with a really basic reading mistake, I hope you&#8217;ll still find this game entertaining.<br />

no,Category,Good,Bad<br />
1,Opening,Overall it felt okay considering it was a non-traditional opening; but nothing spectacular.,<strong>Move 28: </strong>This may have been too slow. Giving Black the initiative on the lower left was rough.<br />
2,Middle Game,It felt more or less in my favor; but a bit risky.,Black got a big left side which sort of forced me to try and kill his group.<br />
3,Fighting,<strong>Move 38:</strong> I was proud of starting this fight since I had an advantage in this area.,<strong>Move 98:</strong> This is probably my losing move. Letting my stones get weakened like that was bad.<br />
4,Endgame,Not Applicable,Not Applicable<br />
5,Overall Reading,<strong>Move 74-97:</strong> Felt proud for being able to continually harass this group / almost killing it.,<strong>Move 106:</strong> No excuses for this move. Complete misread.<br />

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 style="text-align: center;">Introduction</h2>
<p>And we&#8217;re back for the second week of Thursday Go Tygem! Unfortunately since the last game, I was demoted to 2d. No matter though! The opponents are still dans, so we march onwards!<br />
This game I take White against a 2d. The opening starts out with a terrible exchange on my part, and then a crazy fight for supremacy in the middle game breaks out after he makes a mistake in trying to cut apart my groups. Definitely a game that demonstrates how kiai (i.e., fighting spirit) can make a big difference in a position where you are initially at a disadvantage.<br />
As always, please let me know if there is anything I can do to improve this series for you guys!<br />

no,Category,Good,Bad<br />
1,Opening,<strong>Moves 44:</strong> Was proud to find this move to resist Black’s attempt to get an overwhelming advantage in the opening.,<strong>Move 18+:</strong> The push cut exchange made me over-concentrated and in bad position.<br />
2,Middle Game,Overall it felt like the middle game was in my favor and I outplayed my opponent.,<strong>Move 168:</strong> Avoiding the ko was so indescribably bad because there was no ko. *hangs head in shame* Could have been such an easy game&#8230;<br />
3,Fighting,<strong>Move 122+:</strong> I was quite proud to be able to fight on even grounds in such close proximity here.,<strong>Move 168:</strong> So shameful it gets restated twice. Just so bad.<br />
4,Endgame,<strong>Move 212:</strong> I was proud to find this attachment quickly to reduce Black’s area., Can’t say I was great at identifying the biggest value on the board; but tried to use sente/gote moves as my points of reference.<br />
5,Overall Reading,<strong>Move 80:</strong> Outreading Black by knowing the cut didn’t work was very satisfying.,<strong>Move 188:</strong> This should have been at R3 to make life in the corner and would have changed the result of the game.<br />
