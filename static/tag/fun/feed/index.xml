				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>During my game review for the first match of the month, I had a disturbing revelation. As Inseong was talking about my mistakes, he then commented on how attacking was one of the most pleasurable aspects of go. Suddenly, a lightbulb went off in my head as I realized what had been missing from my games all this time: I had forgotten how to attack.<br />
As I sat there, I thought, “Me? Not attacking properly? Not enjoying the attack? How far have I fallen?”<br />
Needless to say, it got me wondering if this was what was wrong with me over these past couple of weeks; but what’s funny is that life had something else in store for me as well. Though I didn&#8217;t know it at the time, something that I had volunteered to help out at was happening the same weekend: the <a title="Smithsonian Folklife Festival Official Page" href="http://www.festival.si.edu/">Smithsonian Folklife Festival</a> was about to give me the wake-up call that I needed.<br />
<a href="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/07/chinafestival.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-5538" src="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/07/chinafestival.jpg?resize=338%2C317" alt="chinafestival" width="338" height="317" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><br />
At first, with me being down lately, I have to admit that I was a bit reluctant to go as the day crept up. Before I knew it though, Saturday was upon me and I was sitting down and teaching person after person. And with each person that sat down, seeing their eyes light up as they learned the rules and enjoyed their time was really heart-warming for me. Out of all the ones I taught though, there was one in particular that I want to mention here.<br />
A young girl (probably around 6-8 years old) and her mother decided to stop by to learn the game. As I taught the rules to the girl and proceeded through my own curriculum of how I believe go should be taught, she picked it up with relative ease. And with each new milestone in learning the game, her eyes lit up and a smile spread across her face that I can only describe as absolutely adorable.<br />
Fast forward a bit, and I decide that she’s ready to try an actual game of go. I had commandeered the big 9&#215;9 magnetic board (with huge pieces) that is used for demonstration at the time. So as one can expect, there was a bit of a crowd around us by the time our game started. I gave her 7 stones as a handicap and we started playing.<br />
To my utter surprise, she ignored most of my overplays and played such calm and beautiful moves! If I tried to hane on one stone, she would ignore me and just connect her stones together only to leave me in dismay. And before I knew it, she killed my entire group and owned the entire board.<br />
Now, while another person might have found it to be embarrassing, I thought it was the perfect opportunity to demonstrate to the crowd what it looked like to get demolished and to explain that resigning was an honorable thing to do in this game. This got quite a big laugh of course. And as I turned to the girl and her mom to tell her how she did an incredible job crushing me, she beamed with happiness and pride that made the entire spectacle entirely worth it.<br />
The reason I’m writing this is because it’s really easy to get caught up in the competitive aspects of go. After all, most players who end up playing this game long term are usually playing to become the strongest player they can possibly be. But after my experiences these last few days, I’m reminded of the fact that there is far more to go than simply gaining that next stone.<br />
Though it’s easy to forget, finding happiness and fun in go is just as important (if not the most) when taking that next step in your journey as a go player. I’m not quite out of the woods yet in regards to my own slump, but I can tell you that this weekend was the ray of light that I needed as I start to make my way toward the end of the tunnel.</p>

Whether you like it or not, studying is one of the most important aspects of getting stronger at go. While some players are able to simply learn everything through playing and reviewing, this is often reliant on stronger players or even simple luck of figuring out what is wrong with your moves or thinking process. As a result, there is no telling how fast you will improve.<br />
Unfortunately, this is one of the most dreaded aspects of trying getting stronger for most players. After all, it reminds us of our school days where homework and projects were a drag and no one ever wanted to do them. So, as the last installment of Weekly Go Wednesday (at least for the time being), I thought it would be best to leave you with my thoughts on how you can keep your study of go interesting so that you can continue to climb the ranks.<br />
<span id="more-2548"></span><br />
In order to help make studying more interesting, we must start by giving ourselves the right mindset when thinking about studying. Although the image jokes about how studying ends with the word &#8220;dying,&#8221; one should not view studying as a dreaded chore; but instead as <strong>an opportunity to explore topics of interest</strong>. By doing so, one no longer thinks of the cumbersome tasks that lie ahead; but will instead look forward to each studying session.<br />
Once you have the right mindset, here are some tips that I use to help keep myself motivated to consistently study go:<br />
<strong>1. Only study things that are of interest to <em>you</em>.</strong> As much as everyone goes on about how important life and death is, if that subject bores you to tears, don&#8217;t do it. Study whatever else makes <em>you</em> happy and makes the game enjoyable. That might be attacking, joseki, tesuji, fuseki, endgame, whatever. Although it might seem like you are neglecting other areas, I have found that those other areas eventually become topics of interest as you gain a greater understanding of the game.<br />
<strong>2. Follow a couple of professional players that you are fans of. </strong>It&#8217;s much more fun studying professional games when you are rooting for your favorite player or trying to understand why your pro played the way he did. In addition, the emotional attachment you have to your favorite player winning or losing will make the things you learn stick that much more in your brain. And if you don&#8217;t know which professionals to follow, two easy names that I would recommend starting with are <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gu_Li">Gu Li</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_Sedol">Lee Sedol</a>.<br />
<strong>3. Keep your study sessions short.</strong> If the study sessions are too long, it can cause you to study more infrequently and procrastinate study sessions since you&#8217;ll always have the excuse, &#8220;I don&#8217;t have enough time.&#8221; It&#8217;s better to cut your studying in chunks in order to allow more material to be dispersed over time which inadvertently marinates in your brain and has more time to be absorbed into your actual play.<br />
Best of luck in your studies and pursuit of the next stone. Till next time!</p>
