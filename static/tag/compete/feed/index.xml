<figure id="attachment_5198" style="width: 500px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/washingbadukopenpart2-01.png"><img class=" wp-image-5198" alt="washingbadukopenpart2-01" src="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/washingbadukopenpart2-01.png?resize=500%2C375" width="500" height="375" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Hikaru No Go, Kuwabara Hon’inbo (Epsiode 29)</figcaption></figure>
When I woke up the next day, I felt like a brand new person. I know that I could have been like a lot of other players who would have recalled the performance from the first day and felt sorry for themselves, but the the experience I had watching Park Sohyun (3p) play the night before had struck me and really opened my eyes.<br />
I was running a little late that morning, and ended up getting there around 9:35am. According to the schedule, I was already late and so I half-expected to find everyone already playing their games and my clock already running. However, it seemed like I wasn&#8217;t the only one running late because the pairings hadn&#8217;t even been put up when I arrived.<br />
After catching up with some people though, the roster was finally put up. As I scanned the list, I found my opponent: a 5 kyu. He would be taking Black and I was giving him no handicap.<br />
My opponent was 5 kyu and I wasn&#8217;t giving him a handicap. Had it been yesterday, I probably would have been frustrated that I was &#8220;demoted;&#8221; but I was past those stupid egotistical thoughts today.<br />
As I sat down in front of my opponent, I was very clear on what I was going to do: I was going to try and play like Sohyun did the night before. It was going to be strong and interesting go. That&#8217;s the go I would play. Below is the kifu. (The commentary version will be Monday Go Meditation: Game 63)<br />

<p style="text-align: left;">It was an exciting game, but one that I felt far more in control of than any of the games previously. When my opponent resigned, I let out a sigh of relief. &#8220;Yes.&#8221; I thought, &#8220;At least I&#8217;m now 2-2. And to top it off, I&#8217;m feeling a hell of a lot better than yesterday.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">After Round 4, Myung Wan Kim (9p) and I grabbed our bento boxes (unfortunately I didn&#8217;t take a photo this time, but I got the <a title="Galbi Wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galbi">galbi</a> one) and I took him back to the hotel so he could rest / work on other things (since there was a few hours gap before he had to be back).</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">When I dropped him off, he asked me to pick him up around 3:10pm. So when I arrived back at the tournament, I looked at the time.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">&#8220;1:00pm is when Round 5 starts,&#8221; I thought, &#8220;And assuming my game takes even just the main time alone, I would be over time and late picking up Myung.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">With my record at 2-2, I seriously debated not playing in the 5th round and taking a buy. After all, 2-2 isn&#8217;t a bad record to end the tournament with right?</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">A good part of this was my insecurity at the prospects of possibly ending the tournament with a record of 2-3 and losing the final round, but I realized quickly that it was stupid. I decided to simply play in the 5th Round, and if push came to shove, I would resign the game if it took too long because I wanted to make sure I would pick up Myung on time.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Before I knew it, the fifth round pairings were up. My opponent was a 4 kyu that I knew from the area. There would be no handicap and I was taking white. Below are the results of the my final game for the tournament. (The commentary version will be Monday Go Meditation: Game 64)</p>

<p>When the game was coming close to the end, time was also drawing near as well. It was around 2:30pm when I had begun my final hunt to kill the group on the top; but my opponent still had plenty of time left on his clock, so I couldn&#8217;t fault him for trying to take the time to make sure he was really dead. However, with time drawing close, I began mentally preparing myself to resign and simply be satisfied with the game that I had played.<br />
As you might imagine, I breathed a sigh of relief and thanked my lucky stars when he resigned. &#8220;Hoorah!&#8221; I thought, &#8221; I still can go pickup Myung with time to spare!&#8221; And with that, I went to report my results and went off to pick him up.<br />
When we got back, there was still some time to spare before the remaining festivities began (i.e., lecture and simul games). This was perfect however, because  I was able to spend some time talking with Sohyun (since she had been running in and out and busy with other obligations). We went over my game in Round 5, and I even got her to sign a book that she had given me the night before.<br />
<figure id="attachment_5206" style="width: 358px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/haengmaBook.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-5206" alt="haengmaBook" src="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/haengmaBook-768x1024.jpg?resize=358%2C477" width="358" height="477" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">It&#8217;s a Korean book on haengma (i.e., stone movement). Best souvenir from the event!</figcaption></figure>
As we wrapped up one of our conversations, a fellow Korean player had come by; so she had the idea to give both of us a simul game while we were waiting for everything to start (which was incredibly kind of her). I decided to play an even game with her since I wanted to feel the full power of her skills.<br />
Unfortunately we were only able to play about 20 or so moves before she was summoned to play the official simul games scheduled for the event. However, what I will say about the game was that even in that series of short exchanges, it was quite an experience to watch her start dismantling what I thought was a good position.<br />
With all the games finished, they had the following activities going on simultaneously:<br />
(1) Myung Wan Kim (9p) reviewing one of Andy Liu&#8217;s (1p) game from the tournament.<br />

So many people participating!</figcaption></figure>
After a couple of hours, the time finally came for the awards ceremony.<br />
The tournament was broken up into seven sections:</p>
<ol>
<li><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">Open Section (7d+)</span></li>
<li><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">Dan A (4-6d)</span></li>
<li><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">Dan B (1-3d)</span></li>
<li><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">Kyu A (1-5k)</span></li>
<li><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">Kyu B (6-10k)</span></li>
<li><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">Kyu C (11-15k)</span></li>
<li><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">Kyu D (16k+)</span></li>
</ol>
<p>When they announced the first place prize for the Kyu D division, &#8220;&#8230; 1st Place, trophy and $100&#8221; echoed over the microphone. As I heard the cash prize amount, I&#8217;d be lying if I said that part of me didn&#8217;t feel just a twinge of jealously as I heard the cash prize amount. After all, it wasn&#8217;t chump change by any stretch of the means!<br />
As I sat there listening to them announce the winners, I recalled the time that I had won first place in the <a title="NOVA Pumpkin Classic Tournament 2012 — Conclusion" href="//nova-pumpkin-classic-tournament-2012-conclusion/">Pumpkin Classic</a>. I smiled as I remembered that momentous feeling. And a small part of me wished that I had done better in the tournament; but then I reminded myself that I had nothing to be ashamed of for this tournament. After all, on top managing to bring my record up to 3-2, the experiences and the lessons that I had learned through this tournament were priceless and I would not have traded it in for a better record or any trophy or prize money.<br />
&#8220;Kyu A Division (1-5k),&#8221; echoed over the microphone.<br />
My attention returned to the present as I thought.  &#8220;Oo&#8230; I wonder who won my division.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>&#8212; let&#8217;s pause and let&#8217;s rewind the clock for a sec &#8212;</em></p>
<p>Earlier when I had been walking around, I had heard the tournament directors talking about how the kyu divisions did not have any people who won 4 games except for one person. (I later found out it was Bob Crites who had been performing well in tournaments recently.)<br />
A part of me became hopeful at that thought that maybe I was still in the running for something, but then I brushed the notion aside as I recalled that I had not exactly played my best consistently in the tournament.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>&#8212; return to present moment &#8212;</em></p>
<p>&#8220;3rd Place &#8211; Weixin Wang, 4k &#8211; $50 and a trophy&#8221;<br />
*applause and multiple cameras taking photos going off*<br />
&#8220;Huh,&#8221; I thought, &#8220;That&#8217;s the guy I lost to in the 3rd round. If he got third place, then I&#8217;m most definitely out of the running now.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;2nd Place &#8211; John Zhao, 3k &#8211; $100 and a trophy&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Wait,&#8221; I thought, &#8220;That&#8217;s the guy I beat in the 1st round. Maybe I still have a shot?&#8221;<br />
As I&#8217;m sitting there bewildered and trying to make sense of how the tiebreakers might actually work, the microphone echoes again:<br />
&#8220;1st Place &#8211; Benjamin Hong&#8230;&#8221;<br />
<figure id="attachment_5208" style="width: 347px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/05/omgcat.gif"><img class="size-full wp-image-5208" alt="Wait... What?! *turns around to see if I'm not the only one who heard that*" src="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/05/omgcat.gif?resize=347%2C225" width="347" height="225" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Wait&#8230; What?! *turns around to confirm that I&#8217;m not the only one who heard that*</figcaption></figure>
I honestly wish someone had taken a picture of my face, because I can tell you that I was completely and utterly surprised. But yeah, I wasn&#8217;t hallucinating or imaging things. I really did get 1st place.<br />
<figure style="width: 448px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/05/2014-WOpen-22.jpg"><img class=" " alt="2014-WOpen-22" src="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/05/2014-WOpen-22.jpg?resize=448%2C298" width="448" height="298" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">There&#8217;s my first prize envelope. The cash prize was $200!</figcaption></figure>
<figure id="attachment_5209" style="width: 467px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/05/2014-WOpen-21.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-5209  " alt="2014-WOpen-21" src="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/05/2014-WOpen-21.jpg?resize=467%2C700" width="467" height="700" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Here&#8217;s the trophy I got as well. Looks pretty sweet!</figcaption></figure>
The thing about tournaments is that you never know what&#8217;s going to happen. I went the first day with a 1-2 record and completely thought I was out of the running. In fact, I even thought about dropping out the last round because of stupid insecurities. Imagine if I had done that? Imagine if I had just given up? The story would not have been nearly as exciting would it?<br />
Though I am very grateful that I got 1st place, I really believe that this tournament will forever go down as one of the pinnacle moments in my journey as a go player. The experiences and things that I learned about myself through the trials and tribulations are ones that I will forever remember fondly and I look forward to continue building on them.<br />
Many thanks also goes out to Keith, Gary, Andy, Todd, Alan, the Korean Baduk Association and many others for making this tournament a huge success. And of course, special thanks goes out to <a title="SmartGo Official Site" href="https://www.smartgo.com/">SmartGo</a> for its awesome iPad app that serves as my trusty sidekick for recording my games.<br />
Finally, a huge thanks goes out to Myung Wan Kim (9p) and Park Sohyun (3p) for making this tournament an unforgettable experience and providing guidance when I really needed it!</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">Hey everyone! Welcome to Part I of my awesome experience at the 1st Washington Open Baduk Championship this past weekend! Though many of you already know the results of the tournament, I&#8217;ll start by asking you all to refrain from commenting on the actual result till Part II since some don&#8217;t know yet.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">In addition, I&#8217;m sure that many of you are eager to see what kind of games I played, so I have gone ahead and uploaded the kifu for your enjoyment. Commentary will come in future Monday Go Meditations (which I will note for each game); but hopefully you will forgive me for not being to add commentary within such a short time.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">With that said, let&#8217;s get started!</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span id="more-5140"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">To start, even though the tournament officially started on Saturday, I had the pleasure of getting to hangout and spend time with Myung Wang Kim (9p) and Park Sohyun (3p) on Friday. (In case some of you didn&#8217;t know, I got to know Myung at the <a title="North American Go Convention — Day 2" href="//north-american-go-convention-day-2/">North American Go Convention</a> last year.) After letting them do some exploring, we got dinner at a nearby Korean restaurant with some distinguished guests and ate delicious food.*</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><em>*Many thanks to our gracious hosts for footing the bill that night. It was a wonderful meal and was full of great conversation and great company.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Around the time dinner was wrapping up, I noticed that some of the guests were speaking to Myung in Korean. It seemed as if they were inviting him somewhere, and I was a little sad at the prospect of having to part ways so early in the evening; but to my great surprise, Myung then turned to me and asked if I would be interested in going with them to the local Korean baduk club?</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Me? Interested in visiting a local Korean baduk club? Absolutely!</p>
<figure id="attachment_5156" style="width: 448px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014-WOpen-02.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-5156" alt="2014-WOpen-02" src="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014-WOpen-02.jpg?resize=448%2C448" width="448" height="448" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Here&#8217;s a shot of the inside of the club. I refrained from taking any direct pictures of people playing since I didn&#8217;t want anyone feeling uncomfortable from me doing so.</figcaption></figure>
<p style="text-align: left;">When we walked into the club, it was amazing for me to see so many gorgeous boards and bowls sitting in one room. And to top it off, there were people playing! So cool! Granted, they all spoke Korean with one another so I was rather lost when it came to what they were talking about. However, it was nice to just bask in the atmosphere and while hearing the pleasant sound of the stones clicking on the board.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">After some time, we said our goodbyes and I took them back to their hotel so that they could rest since we had to be up early the next day.</p>
<figure id="attachment_5157" style="width: 358px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014-WOpen-03.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-5157" alt="2014-WOpen-03" src="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014-WOpen-03.jpg?resize=358%2C478" width="358" height="478" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">This was the banner you were greeted with when you walked out of the elevator.</figcaption></figure>
<p style="text-align: left;">Before I knew it, the momentous day had arrived. It was officially the first day of the 1st Washing Open Baduk Championship!</p>
<figure id="attachment_5158" style="width: 512px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014-WOpen-04.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-5158" alt="2014-WOpen-04" src="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014-WOpen-04.jpg?resize=512%2C384" width="512" height="384" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Look at all the people registering! And I got there pretty early too!</figcaption></figure>
When I arrived in the lobby for registration, I was pleasantly surprised to see so many people waiting in line! &#8220;Hoorah!&#8221; I thought, &#8220;Hopefully this will help convince the sponsors* to continue doing this again next year!&#8221;<br />
<em>*In case you didn&#8217;t know, this tournament was being hosted and sponsored by a number of Korean companies (you can see their logos above in the first banner) and featured a number of awesome perks like free entry fee, free lunch on both days, and even cash prizes).</em><br />
<figure id="attachment_5159" style="width: 512px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014-WOpen-05.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-5159" alt="2014-WOpen-05" src="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014-WOpen-05.jpg?resize=512%2C384" width="512" height="384" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">The sight of a room full of gobans and stones with people playing / discussing variations is always a great joy.</figcaption></figure>
<p style="text-align: left;">When I arrived in the playing room, I was also glad to already see a number of people already sitting and getting acclimated to the area. And as you can see, we were adequately prepared for a large number of players!</p>
<figure id="attachment_5160" style="width: 410px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014-WOpen-06.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-5160" alt="2014-WOpen-06" src="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014-WOpen-06.jpg?resize=410%2C546" width="410" height="546" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Here&#8217;s the schedule for both days. And if you&#8217;re wondering what&#8217;s in the upper right, they had Wi-Fi for everyone as well (which was awesome if I may say so myself).</figcaption></figure>
After a bit of waiting and catching up with various friends, the pairings were finally up. It was the fateful moment that you either dread or wait with anticipation when any tournament rolls around: the first round! The game that will set the stage for the rest of the tournament!<br />
My opponent was an older Chinese man who might have been in his fifties to sixties. He was a 3 kyu and the game was set as even with White getting 7.5 komi. The time settings were 1 hour main time per person with 20 moves per 5 minutes byoyomi.<br />
After exchanging customary greetings and fussing with the clocks for a bit, we started our game. The kifu below is our game. (The commentary version will be Monday Go Meditation: Game 60)<br />

<p style="text-align: left;">Though the game ended up being dramatic, I will have to say that I tried to play a calm and patient game as much as I could. (The idea originates from <a title="Maaike's April Challenge" href="http://www.thegochallenge.blogspot.com.au/2014/04/april-challenge.html">Maaike&#8217;s April Challenge</a>). As you saw, I ended up letting an advantageous position turn into a complete disaster. It was only by sheer patience and luck that I was able to turn it around. The game was one of the longest ones that round. It took more than two hours for us to finish and I used 3 periods of overtime.* Needless to say I was relieved to win, but I was exhausted afterwards as I went off to grab lunch.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><em>*On a side note, I just wanted to rant about how chess clocks are AWFUL for Canadian byoyomi because you end up spending more time trying to figure out whether the flag is about to tip instead of focusing on your move. So you end up playing super fast moves for fear of losing on time. Stressful I tell you!</em></p>
<figure id="attachment_5161" style="width: 512px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014-WOpen-07.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-5161" alt="2014-WOpen-07" src="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014-WOpen-07.jpg?resize=512%2C384" width="512" height="384" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">I got the salmon bento box for lunch! There was a variety of things: rice, korean noodle with some vegetables, potato salad, kimchi, bean sprouts, tempura shrimp, and a couple of other things. Very filling!</figcaption></figure>
Once everyone had eaten lunch, we had our opening ceremony (which seems a little backwards since the event already started, but it was necessary because the VIP guests could not arrive earlier).<br />
<figure id="attachment_5162" style="width: 512px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014-WOpen-08.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-5162" alt="2014-WOpen-08" src="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014-WOpen-08.jpg?resize=512%2C384" width="512" height="384" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">You can see them giving speeches up front and everyone being respectful and listening.</figcaption></figure>
After the ceremony was done, it was time for Round 2. My opponent this time was a Chinese woman in her forties to fifties and a 2 kyu. Since I won the first round though, there would be no handicap and White would still get 7.5 points.*<br />
<em>*In AGA tournaments, it seems that they calculate handicaps not based on rank but on your performance in the tournament as it progresses. </em><br />
Before the game started, I decided I would continue to try and play a calm game. The kifu below is the result. (The commentary version will be Monday Go Meditation: Game 61)<br />

<div id='glift_display4' style='height:500px; width:100%; position:relative;'></div>

<p style="text-align: left;">To be honest, I thought that I was ahead for most of the game. I thought I had done a good job securing territory and keeping White&#8217;s territory small. However, I never actually counted and only did rough estimations.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">My game took long as usual (though not as long as the first round) and there were a few people watching my game when it came time to counting. To my shock and disappointment (though probably not to your surprise), I was actually behind by 20+ points. My opponent was kind enough to try and say I was very strong and that she thought she was losing, but the defeat stung still stung quite a bit.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">After the game, I did my best to try and pick myself back up. After all, it&#8217;s just one loss right? My record was 1-1 now. No big deal. Just brush it off and play better the next round. However, Round 3 was upon me before I knew it (since there was no real break between the rounds).</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">At the end of the last round, I mentioned that there were a few people watching towards the end. One of those was the gentleman that I would end up playing this round. He was also a Chinese man in his forties to fifties and was a 4 kyu. In this game however, I would receive give him a 1 stone handicap and only got 0.5 komi. The kifu below is our game. (The commentary version will be Monday Go Meditation: Game 62)</p>

<p>It was an awful game. My stamina had already been spent with the first round. So with that and the fact that I was still rattled by my loss in Round 2, I could not keep calm and played one of the worst games I&#8217;ve played to date. Complete overplays and getting into fights I had no business getting into.<br />
Resigning within 100 moves&#8230; My record was now 1-2&#8230; Needless to say, I was upset and really disappointed with myself.<br />
After the game, I took Myung back to the hotel so he could get some rest before the lecture that night. We talked some in the car and I was given a lot to think about. I then went off to eat dinner by myself before it was time to pick him up again.<br />
<figure id="attachment_5163" style="width: 512px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014-WOpen-09.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-5163" alt="2014-WOpen-09" src="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014-WOpen-09.jpg?resize=512%2C384" width="512" height="384" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Unfortunately I only got one shot of Myung during his lecture, but I guess it&#8217;s better than nothing. (Would have preferred to have gotten one when there were stones on the board, but I was too focused on the lecture to remember to take another one.)</figcaption></figure>
After picking him up, we went back to the convention and Myung lectured on a joseki that had recently been created by young Korean professionals. A lot of it went over my head, but it was very cool to see how go is constantly evolving and changing.<br />
Once the lecture was finished, the crowd dispersed into different groups. A blitz tournament was about to start. And though I had originally planned on participating, I was not feeling up to it and decided not to. After all, today had been a rather disturbing revelation of the limitations of my go. I played one decent game and then proceeded to crash and burn&#8230;<br />
Earlier during the lecture, I had seen Park Sohyun (3p) come in and then leave the room with one of the VIP with a board and stones. While some people went up to ask Myung some questions, I decided to go check and see what she was up to. As I prepared to walk around, the following quotation from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/First-Kyu-Sung-Hwa-Hong/dp/0964479699">First Kyu</a> popped in my head:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;First kyu, a player of the first rank? Really? Have you ever competed in a professional qualifying tournament? No? Then you are not, I repeat NOT first kyu!<br />
I know I know. Nowadays all kinds of bad players call themselves first kyu.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8220;Maybe I&#8217;m just a fake 3 kyu,&#8221; I thought as I walked to find her, &#8220;Perhaps I was too naive and arrogant in thinking I could compete, let alone win, as a 3 kyu&#8230;&#8221;</p>
