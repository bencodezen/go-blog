<h2 style="text-align: center;">Master Play: The Fighting Styles of Kato Masao &amp; Seo Bong Soo</h2>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> In this X volume of the Master Play series, Yuan Zhou does a magnificent job taking amateur players through what is actually considered &#8220;fighting style&#8221; in the professional world of go. Due to the chaotic nature that go can take in crazy cross-cuts and blown out battles, it is no surprise that many kyu players might consider themselves &#8220;fighters,&#8221; but once you read this book, it might open to your eyes as to what fighting really means.<br />

[expand title=&#8221;Before I Read This Book&#8230;&#8221; trigclass=&#8221;expandTitle&#8221;]
Like many kyu players out there, I always considered myself to have a &#8220;fighting style.&#8221; After all, my games consisted primarily of big battles and trying to kill things. If that&#8217;s not fighting, what is right? Well I wanted to find out for myself whether I could see my go in famous professional players actually known for their fighting. So as I&#8217;m in a bit of a haze in my journey at the moment, it wasn&#8217;t long before I found myself purchasing this book to try and shed some light on my own style.<br />
[/expand]
[expand title=&#8221;My Review&#8221; trigclass=&#8221;expandTitle&#8221; expanded=&#8221;true&#8221;]
Similar to the previous volumes I read (Master Play: The Style of Lee Changho and The Style of Go Seigen), Yuan Zhou began each section with a brief introduction to the player&#8217;s background. Being as I am still quite unfamiliar with the professional go scene, it was very entertaining while very informative. Without the introductions, I imagine that the game review would not have been nearly as enjoyable.<br />
In this volume, Zhou reviews two monumental games from each players&#8217; career. With each one, the diagrams are usually quite short and the accompanying explanations really helped me to follow the games without much issue. It definitely feels like the explanations were written with kyu amateur players in mind.<br />
It was just utterly astounding seeing how these infamous &#8220;fighters&#8221; actually played.<br />
Yet again, Yuan Zhou does not fail to amaze me with how he is able to explain what is going on in the board.<br />

<strong>What did I enjoy about the book?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Topics are broken down into simple explanations that I could easily understand.</li>
<li>The topics are extremely relevant to the average player.</li>
<li>Yang usually has a checklist of questions for each section to remind the reader of the important things to remember.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What did I gain from reading this book?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A significant increase in my comfort to tenuki in the opening.</li>
<li>An eye-opening perspective on how to try to select my attacks now.</li>
<li>A leap forward in trying to understand how complicated josekis develop.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What style of teaching does the book use?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Workshop Format
<ul>
<li>Topics of broken down into its simplest format and represents more of an outline than a thorough textbook.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Primary Learning Mechanism:
<ul>
<li>Explanations with accompanying diagrams</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Other Learning Mechanisms:

<ul>
<li>No complaints here!</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Is this book easy to read?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Yes. The explanations are concise and the accompanying diagrams are often no more than a few moves long.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Bottom Line</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Does a fanatastic job explaining concepts that used to be rather muddled to me.</li>
<li>Has a lot of incredible content for such a short book!</li>
<li>Worth every penny you spend on it!</li>
</ol>

[expand title=&#8221;Before I Read This Book&#8230;&#8221; trigclass=&#8221;expandTitle&#8221;]
<strong>My Abilities</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A mid-high SDK (single digit kyu) who has read his fair share of books and has a decent foundation of most areas in go.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>My Perspective</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Since these are written to be more of a &#8220;workshop&#8221; format, I was looking forward to a new style of writing along with a refreshing perspective on some common questions that most players might have.</li>
</ul>
[/expand]
[expand title=&#8221;My Review&#8221; trigclass=&#8221;expandTitle&#8221; expanded=&#8221;true&#8221;]
This was a refreshing perspective on common go questions. Yilun Yang&#8217;s ability to break down popular topics like &#8220;Determining What Direction to Attack&#8221; was incredibly easy to understand. Contrary to some typical go literature where the concept is explained to death, Yang provides more of a road map on how to actually apply the principle instead of simply understanding it. Now granted, I will be the first to say that actually applying it to your game is not so easy; but my understanding has certainly grown and I am now trying out new things as a result. I am really looking forward to the next books in the series!<br />

[expand title=&#8221;Before I Read This Book&#8230;&#8221; trigclass=&#8221;expandTitle&#8221;]
<strong>My Abilities</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>When it came to moyo (i.e. frameworks), I had one of two weapons in my arsenal: (1) Build the biggest framework possible and hopefully kill anything that comes inside. (2) Always invade my opponent&#8217;s framework and try to live. In the rare occasion that I thought to reduce the framework, the timing was usually off.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>My Perspective</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>By reading this book, I was hoping to gain a more balanced perspective on how to deal with and build moyos. Though I did not have a chance to preview the book, I was also hoping the teaching format would be a combination of explanations along with practice problems.</li>
</ul>
[/expand]
[expand title=&#8221;My Review&#8221; trigclass=&#8221;expandTitle&#8221; expanded=&#8221;true&#8221;]
<strong>What did I enjoy about the book?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>I really liked how they broke down attacking and defending moyos into 13 basic principles. Although it may be some time before they stick in my brain, I felt that the one line &#8220;proverbs&#8221; were very helpful.</li>
<li>The practice problems they provided were a great test of the principles that they introduced in the beginning of the book.</li>
<li>The explanations were very clear and usually provided an incorrect variation with an explanation of why it contradicted the 13 basic principles.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What did I gain from reading this book?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A better understanding of how to attack and defend moyos.</li>
<li>Greater confidence in dealing with my opponent&#8217;s moyos.</li>
<li>Inadvertently ended up getting a better understanding of whole board thinking since I have an improved ability to see moyos forming before it is way too late.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What style of teaching does the book use?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Multi-Pronged Approach
<ul>
<li>There are equal parts explanations, practice problems, along with game commentaries.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Learning Mechanisms
<ul>
<li>Explanations with example diagrams</li>
<li>Professional games with commentary</li>
<li>Practice problems</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What aspect can be improved on?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>I am happy to say that this book is great as it stands!</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Is this book easy to read?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Yes. The explanations are explained using laymen terms and are pretty short and straightforward.</li>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Today has been quite an interesting day. In all the games I played today, there seemed to be one consistent theme: When the opponent gives me an opportunity to attack, I am in attack mode the rest of the game.<br />
This is rather reminiscent of my DDK (double digit kyu) days when I would engage in these local battles that just bled onto the rest of the board. The main difference now though is that I am actually aware of the effects my moves have on my other groups and how the progression will affect my territory. Unfortunately, my attacks always fell short by a bit and I&#8217;d end up losing by a rather wide margin.<br />
That being said, there were a number of times where I realized I was probably ahead and should&#8217;ve played more solid moves and let my opponent live. The rational course of action would be to just win the game without any hiccups, but it seems the green eyed go monster has been haunting me all day. Hopefully for my next set of games, I will be able to maintain a calmer demeanor in my go.<br />
Finally, before I close out tonight&#8217;s post, I wanted to give a shout out to Frederic! It was great to meet you and be able to play with you today! Looking forward to playing you more often in the future!</p>
