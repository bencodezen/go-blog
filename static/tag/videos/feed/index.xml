				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Last night I played a fun game against my friend Nate, but was definitely demolished by the end of the game. A 40 point loss&#8230; hahaha. Thought I admit that there was definitely a degree of disappointment in myself for playing so terribly, there is a silver lining in my complete failure.<br />
So my experiment failed miserably, but I am sure that the experience I gained with be valuable in the future. In addition, I am happy knowing that my mistakes were not reading mistakes this time around. Though I may have made plenty of strategic and whole board errors, reducing the number of reading mistakes should prove to be very lethal once I take care of my flawed strategies. For those wondering about the kifu, it&#8217;ll be featured on a Monday Go Meditation in a couple of weeks.<br />
Meanwhile, I have also decided to take my sensei&#8217;s advice and take the time to really watch <a href="http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCYMY6j5mUvPMPzvN5bxuKA">Battousai&#8217;s</a> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLv8NkgCbtGytYtHKchRMLh9l2KVlqW1z6">3D Tygem Series</a>. Perhaps I can follow in his footsteps and gain sudden insight into the game through watching the series. Not sure how it will go, but I&#8217;ll be sure to let you know if anything changes.</p>

It&#8217;s called BadukMovies and is made by Peter Brouwer 6D and Kim Ouweleen 4D and looks like a magnificent wealth of information. I will put up a detailed review for the site in the future, but at the bare minimum I wanted to let you guys know about this site first!</p>
