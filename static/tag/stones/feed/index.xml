<p>Though I&#8217;ve never explicitly stated this, one of my goals with this blog is to bring the most exciting and interesting stories about go that I think anyone with even only the slightest interest in go would enjoy while documenting my own journey. I try not to replicate the amazing work done by <a href="http://www.gogameguru.com/">GoGameGuru</a> and others who document the details of the professional world and serve as a better source for those intricacies of the go world.<br />
So in light of that, I am really excited to introduce the very first guest post on this blog! For those who<span style="line-height: 1.5em;"> don&#8217;t know, there&#8217;s an active forum on go called <a href="http://www.lifein19x19.com/">Life in 19&#215;19</a>, and I came across a magnificent post on a tour of the shop of Mr. Kuroki (who owns the </span><a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="http://www.kurokigoishi.co.jp/english/">Kuroki Goishi Ten</a><span style="line-height: 1.5em;"> shop which sells high quality equipment). It reminded me of </span><a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="http://chiyodad.blogspot.com/2007/04/yunzi-manufacturing-and-books-from.html">ChiyoDad&#8217;s post on yunzi manufacturing</a><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">, so I immediately contacted the author and requested his permission to repost his post here on the blog in order to further spread word of his awesome trip. And since you&#8217;re reading this, it shouldn&#8217;t surprise you to hear that I got permission! So without further delay, hope you enjoy <a href="http://lifein19x19.com/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=2341&amp;sid=a4e3128c00299b30319d260ced9ea0b3">Erythen&#8217;s</a> virtual tour through Mr. Kuroki&#8217;s shop!</span><br />

A few people have expressed interest in seeing my photos of Mr. Kuroki&#8217;s shop/factory in Hyuga, Japan. For those interested, I&#8217;ll intersperse the pictures with commentary.<br />
Prior to leaving Japan I went on one last two week road trip. I debated with myself whether or not to visit Mr. Kuroki&#8217;s factory in Hyuga by the time I reached Kyushu. It&#8217;s not that I didn&#8217;t want to go, but the city is well off the beaten path, and everything else I really wanted to see was on the other side of the island. Nonetheless, curiosity got the better of me and I made the detour.<br />
It took a little while to find his shop, even though it&#8217;s located on the city&#8217;s main road. My difficulties arose from the simple fact that I didn&#8217;t really know what to expect and thus didn&#8217;t know what to look for. After driving around town I found the shop nestled between a small hill and a river; the familiar black and white logo standing out to me.<br />
<a href="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/02/kuroki01.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4684" src="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/02/kuroki01.jpg?resize=600%2C800" alt="kuroki01" width="600" height="800" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><br />
I knew I&#8217;d found the right place, if for nothing else than the scent of Kaya working it&#8217;s way around the parking lot. Near the main entrance there&#8217;s a small building where the board artisan works. I had a chance to visit with him but didn&#8217;t want to disrupt his shift too much so let him continue. Later in the day, Mr. Kuroki brought me back when I expressed interest, and I had a chance to see him apply the grid to a beautiful shogi floorboard. Sadly, by that time though my camera&#8217;s battery was quite low and I didn&#8217;t get a chance to photograph it. Fortunately, I managed to take some snapshots of a few unfinished composite go boards.<br />
<a href="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/02/kuroki02.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4685" src="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/02/kuroki02.jpg?resize=720%2C540" alt="kuroki02" width="720" height="540" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><br />
<a href="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/02/kuroki03.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4686" src="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/02/kuroki03.jpg?resize=600%2C800" alt="kuroki03" width="600" height="800" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><br />
<a href="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/02/kuroki04.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4687" src="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/02/kuroki04.jpg?resize=720%2C540" alt="kuroki04" width="720" height="540" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><br />
Walking into the main building, one is bombarded by the sweet, subtle scent of Kaya. It surprised me how small the shop itself was. I don&#8217;t know why, but I expected something much larger. Dozens of Kaya boards lined the walls to the north and east, while a large table showing a few of the less expensive Kaya and Katsura boards dominated the center next to a small space for waiting guests. To the far west a myriad of go bowls stood on display. A large glass case rested next to the door on the south showing various some of the more pricey boards and a small selection of shogi equipment.<br />
<a href="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/02/kuroki05.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4688" src="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/02/kuroki05.jpg?resize=720%2C540" alt="kuroki05" width="720" height="540" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><br />
<a href="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/02/kuroki06.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4689" src="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/02/kuroki06.jpg?resize=720%2C540" alt="kuroki06" width="720" height="540" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><br />
<a href="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/02/kuroki07.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4690" src="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/02/kuroki07.jpg?resize=600%2C800" alt="kuroki07" width="600" height="800" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><br />
I&#8217;m not sure about the others that I pictured, but I do know that this Hyuga Kaya board is still for sale. On the website, scroll down the Hyuga Kaya masame boards and you&#8217;ll see it currently priced at 980,000 yen. I apologize in advance, but my camera focused on the display case and not the board, but you can still see how nice it is.<br />

<a href="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/02/kuroki08.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4691" src="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/02/kuroki08.jpg?resize=720%2C540" alt="kuroki08" width="720" height="540" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><br />
<a href="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/02/kuroki09.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4692" src="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/02/kuroki09.jpg?resize=720%2C540" alt="kuroki09" width="720" height="540" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><br />
Walking around the shop you enter an Omiage store. It doesn&#8217;t really have anything to do with Go so I didn&#8217;t take any pictures. This section mostly caters to the various tourist buses that pass through town on their way to someplace more exciting. While Hyuga is of interest to Go connoisseurs, there really isn&#8217;t much else there.<br />
Walking around the corner and ignoring the souvenir shop you enter a display area where one can see the actual factory and the stone construction process. In this photo, you see how stones are traditionally made. Most new stones aren&#8217;t manufactured in this way anymore, though from my understanding, Mr. Kuroki still processes the native Hyuga stones (at least the larger ones) in this hand-made fashion; after all, would you expect anything less for such aristocratic game pieces.<br />
<a href="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/02/kuroki10.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4693" src="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/02/kuroki10.jpg?resize=720%2C540" alt="kuroki10" width="720" height="540" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><br />
I don&#8217;t know what most of the machines in these next pictures do. Some punch the stones from the shells, others from the slate. A few work the stones down and others polish them. Again I apologize for the fuzziness of the images. My camera doesn&#8217;t do too well behind glass.<br />

<a href="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/02/kuroki15.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4698" src="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/02/kuroki15.jpg?resize=720%2C540" alt="kuroki15" width="720" height="540" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><br />
<a href="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/02/kuroki16.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4699" src="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/02/kuroki16.jpg?resize=600%2C800" alt="kuroki16" width="600" height="800" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><br />
These are what the stones look like when first cut from their shells. Mr. Kuroki has tens of thousands laying around the grounds near his shop. Whenever cuts are rejected, they just dump them around outside for decoration.<br />
<a href="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/02/kuroki17.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4700" src="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/02/kuroki17.jpg?resize=720%2C540" alt="kuroki17" width="720" height="540" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><br />
Finished stones that are accepted go through a sorting process. Grade and quality are determined and the shells are then put into storage until someone purchases them. From my understanding, they go through another quality check before being shipped out.<br />
<a href="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/02/kuroki18.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4701" src="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/02/kuroki18.jpg?resize=720%2C540" alt="kuroki18" width="720" height="540" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><br />
<a href="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/02/kuroki19.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4702" src="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/02/kuroki19.jpg?resize=600%2C800" alt="kuroki19" width="600" height="800" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><br />
<a href="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/02/kuroki20.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4703" src="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/02/kuroki20.jpg?resize=600%2C800" alt="kuroki20" width="600" height="800" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><br />
One of the things I found very interesting was the small display showing different levels of the manufacturing process. A lot more than a simple cut, shape and polish goes into the manufacturing process.<br />
<a href="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/02/kuroki21.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4704" src="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/02/kuroki21.jpg?resize=720%2C540" alt="kuroki21" width="720" height="540" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><br />
In the first photo here, you&#8217;ll see how the stones are cut from Mexican Clamshell and slate. In the second photo, you see the legendary Hyuga clamshell and how the stones are cut from these precious shells.<br />
<a href="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/02/kuroki22.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4705" src="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/02/kuroki22.jpg?resize=720%2C540" alt="kuroki22" width="720" height="540" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><br />
<a href="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/02/kuroki23.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4706" src="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/02/kuroki23.jpg?resize=720%2C540" alt="kuroki23" width="720" height="540" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><br />
Mr. Kuroki sat me down and we discussed the differences in clamshell. Hyuga clams are very rare now and the larger shells for stones will probably be gone within 5 &#8211; 10 years (if even that). He mentioned the average lifespan of a clam near Hyuga was about 15 years, and in order to get decent stones, they would need to be about 20 years old. Finding shells large enough for stones is difficult in the best of times and now it&#8217;s almost impossible to find anything larger than size 30.<br />
He brought out a set of sized 40 snow grade hyuga stones for me to examine. I was almost afraid to touch the things because just one was worth more than I made in a month (and mind you, I wasn&#8217;t paid poorly while living in Japan). These stones can still be seen on his website (link provided below). For comparison, to the left you&#8217;ll see a Mexican clamshell and to the right, a Hyuga clamshell. In the center are those most valuable of go stones.<br />

<a href="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/02/kuroki24.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4707" src="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/02/kuroki24.jpg?resize=720%2C540" alt="kuroki24" width="720" height="540" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><br />
Mr. Kuroki was a very kind man an treated me like royalty. Above the shop is a rather large all you can eat restaurant and he offered to treat me to a nice meal. It was a pleasure to have an excellent conversation with him while we ate. His English isn&#8217;t the best, but then again neither is my Japanese. Between our broken English/Japanese however, we were able to conduct a very nice discussion.<br />
He was very surprised that some random Caucasian guy would come visit his shop. He told me that those who visited were usually &#8220;rich man or old man.&#8221; In the end, my time was well worth the detour, and I&#8217;m very glad to have had a chance to meet the man behind the website.<br />
My last photo is of my guide, Mr. Kuroki himself. Being of the unphotogenic type I cut myself from the picture:).<br />
I hope you&#8217;d enjoyed this virtual tour through the finest of Japan&#8217;s go stone factories.<br />
For those who are interested in further information, I found this link from the Russian Go Federation. It&#8217;s an interview with Mr. Kuroki.<br />

<p><strong>Description:</strong> &#8220;This is a sample pack of our size 36 slate and shell Go stones, which are among the highest quality Go stones available. It contains three black stones and three white stones. Size 36 refers to the thickness of the stone (in this case 10.4 mm or 0.41 inches). The additional thickness and weight of these stones gives them a pleasant feeling in your hand and produces a sharp and satisfying snapping sound when the stones are played.&#8221; &#8211; GoGameGuru<br />

<strong>What&#8217;s the best aspect about this product?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>It&#8217;s slate and shell. &#8216;Nuff said.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What is the weakest aspect of this product?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Size 36 is pretty big, so if someone is not accounting for it, their board might seem a bit crowded if the board is not drawn to accommodate for it.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Is it durable?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>It&#8217;s slate and shell. Haha. I&#8217;d recommend you handle with care.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Bottom Line</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Totally worth the money if you wanted to ever check out what slate and shell stones are like before investing a lot of money into a set.</li>

[expand title=&#8221;My Review&#8221; trigclass=&#8221;expandTitle&#8221; expanded=&#8221;true&#8221;]
The sample comes in a nice little cloth bag with the BadukBrother logo clearly marked.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/02/slateshellsample02.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-4594" alt="slateshellsample02" src="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/02/slateshellsample02.jpg?resize=490%2C368" width="490" height="368" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">When you remove the stones from the bag, you can see that it is in a nice plastic bag (which provides the actual protection in shipping).</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/02/slateshellsample03.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-4595" alt="slateshellsample03" src="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/02/slateshellsample03.jpg?resize=368%2C490" width="368" height="490" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">With the stones removed, you can see them glistening in the light. Very pretty. =)</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/02/slateshellsample04.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-4596" alt="slateshellsample04" src="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/02/slateshellsample04.jpg?resize=490%2C368" width="490" height="368" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The one thing I will say is that the beautiful pattern you are used to seeing on shell stones was harder to capture in the pictures. I think that this is due to the fact that the size of the stones (and for those who don&#8217;t know, size 36 is pretty large) and that this is a sample pack is a reason for why the pattern is more faded compared to the set that I own. However, since this is not a full set, I would not take this as an alarming fact since your purpose with this sample pack is to really get a feel for slate and shell as opposed to just the look.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/02/slateshellsample05.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-4597" alt="slateshellsample05" src="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/02/slateshellsample05.jpg?resize=490%2C368" width="490" height="368" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">At the end of the day, they arrived in perfect condition which is precisely what someone needs when they want to find out if they really want to own a set of slate and shell. If you&#8217;re interested in getting a slate and shell stone set but worried if the value is worth the price, be sure to grab one of these sample packs from GoGameGuru to help you make an informed decision. Good luck!</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">PS. I do own a full set of slate and shell stones, so let me know if you ever have any questions.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">The Featherweight Go Set</h2>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> &#8220;Weighing in at just 20.5 oz (580 g), the Featherweight Go Set is even lighter than your average travel Go set. But here&#8217;s the thing; it&#8217;s a proper, full sized Go board with stones. It includes size 21 plastic stones (0.3 inches or 8 mm thick) with a 0.8 inch (20 mm) diameter and a durable, full size, crease resistant 19&#215;19 plastic Go board. The board can easily be folded or rolled, making this set highly portable. Keep a set in your bag or briefcase so that you&#8217;re always ready for a serendipitous game of Go!&#8221; &#8211; GoGameGuru<br />

<strong>What&#8217;s the best aspect about this product?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Portability! It&#8217;s one of the lightest products I&#8217;ve encountered while still maintaining decent quality!</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What is the weakest aspect of this product?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>As someone who is used to using real stones, the stones can feel a bit lighter than desired; but to be honest, it beats not having any board or stones to play when you&#8217;re out and about!</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Is it durable?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The stones are plastic and should hold up well enough. The board is made of fabric so it shouldn&#8217;t tear so easily, but will probably wear out over time with use and will eventually need replacing.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Bottom Line</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Great lightweight go set for that one can easily pack without noticing any additional weight or bulkiness.</li>
<li>Recommended for any player looking to always have a go set on hand without the hassle or concern over the safety of a wooden board or real stones.</li>
</ol>

[expand title=&#8221;My Review&#8221; trigclass=&#8221;expandTitle&#8221; expanded=&#8221;true&#8221;]
True to their word, this featherweight go set came packed in a super light way with no bulky boxes!<br />
<figure id="attachment_4492" style="width: 360px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/01/featherweightgoset02.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-4492" alt="featherweightgoset02" src="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/01/featherweightgoset02.jpg?resize=360%2C270" width="360" height="270" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">As you can see, everything fits in one bag!</figcaption></figure>
<figure id="attachment_4493" style="width: 360px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/01/featherweightgoset03.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-4493" alt="featherweightgoset03" src="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/01/featherweightgoset03.jpg?resize=360%2C270" width="360" height="270" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Contents of the bag: two bags of stones and one board</figcaption></figure>
<figure id="attachment_4494" style="width: 360px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/01/featherweightgoset04.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-4494" alt="featherweightgoset04" src="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/01/featherweightgoset04.jpg?resize=360%2C270" width="360" height="270" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">The board unfolded</figcaption></figure>
The board is made of fabric and has a nice feel to it. It does have a little issue staying flat after being packaged and folded for so long, but a little patience and flattening helped to keep it pretty straight. And like the description says, it really does feel like a full size board when you spread it out over the table.<br />
<figure id="attachment_4495" style="width: 360px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/01/featherweightgoset05.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-4495" alt="featherweightgoset05" src="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/01/featherweightgoset05.jpg?resize=360%2C270" width="360" height="270" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Close-up of the stones</figcaption></figure>
As you can see for the stones, they are not simply plastic biconvex stones; but they also have a flat center on both sides in order to ease with the stone placement on the board. Though this is contrary to typical stone design, I think that this works out great for this set since the plastic stones are not very heavy to begin with. So as a result, the flat center really helps out.<br />
<figure id="attachment_4496" style="width: 360px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/01/featherweightgoset06.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-4496" alt="featherweightgoset06" src="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/01/featherweightgoset06.jpg?resize=360%2C270" width="360" height="270" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Entire set in action</figcaption></figure>
<figure id="attachment_4497" style="width: 360px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/01/featherweightgoset07.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-4497" alt="featherweightgoset07" src="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/01/featherweightgoset07.jpg?resize=360%2C270" width="360" height="270" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Close-up of the set in action</figcaption></figure>
As you can see, it&#8217;s a great set that really provides a wonderful experience when it&#8217;s impossible to carry around a wooden board and real stones. As someone who has used cheaper &#8220;featherweight&#8221; sets that were plastic boards and such, this is a huge improvement and is the one I recommend if you&#8217;re looking for your &#8220;featherweight go set.&#8221; Hope this helped!<br />

[expand title=&#8221;My Review&#8221; trigclass=&#8221;expandTitle&#8221; expanded=&#8221;true&#8221;]
In my go collection, I&#8217;ve owned my fair share of different types of stones: yunzi, slate and shell, and plastic. The funny thing is that glass stones have always been relatively inexpensive to some of the stones I have bought; but no longer, that ends with this set!<br />

<span style="line-height: 1.5em;">As someone who started out using yunzi stones, I was a bit surprised at how slippery it was when I first started using it. Stones would slip out of my fingers constantly. However, after a bit of patience and realizing I couldn&#8217;t grip them with the same force I normally gripped yunzi stones, it came a lot easier and they did not fall out nearly as often.</span><span style="line-height: 1.5em;"><br />
</span><br />
At the end of the day, this is a beautiful set that any player would be delighted to have if they are looking for stones with a glossy finish that shine in the light. Highly recommended and as always, let me know if you have any questions about the set!<br />

<h3>Detailed Review</h3>
<p><strong>Size &amp; Weight:</strong> The entire set is as light as a feather and easily fits in practically any bag (except possibly purses).  To further clarify, unless you have cargo pants that have massive pockets, this is not a set you can carry around with you in your pocket. And in all honesty, who wants to play on a board that is pocket size. Can you imagine how small the stones would be?!<br />
<strong>Dura­bil­ity:</strong> The entire set is made of plastic that should survive any normal wear and tear. Now granted, if a child decides to throw a tantrum and stomp all over it, I am pretty sure that your board will be demolished. In terms of the stones, you are far more likely to lose the stones before they ever break or crack. In addition, the magnetic board is adhered pretty well to the plastic; but any decent use of force will allow you to pull it off, so be careful.<br />
<strong>Usabil­ity:</strong> The overall design of the set is done well and quite pleasant to use. Due to the cost of the board however, it is to be expected that the stones are sometimes a little oddly shaped or cut slightly off. This doesn&#8217;t detract from the general usage, but can be a little aesthetically irritating to some people.<br />
Even though the set might come with a couple ill-shaped pieces with missing magnets, the value and quality of the board outmatches the price that you pay for it. Sure, there are many ways to improve the quality of the board; but I wouldn&#8217;t hold my breath for a portable go set with the quality and value of a true wood / stone go set. The purpose of this set is for recreational play during travel as opposed to serious play during tournament, so be sure to have the right expectations when you order this set.</p>

<h3>Detailed Review</h3>
<p><strong>Size &amp; Weight:</strong> Absolutely perfect. It&#8217;s small enough that it could fit in a backpack if you needed to. So unlike a real board and stones, it&#8217;s very easy to store away and doesn&#8217;t take up very much space. And in regards to the weight, it has enough weight to feel solid; but otherwise it&#8217;s super light and easy to carry.<br />
<strong>Dura­bil­ity:</strong> I&#8217;ve had this product for more than a year now and words cannot express how appreciate I am to have a product that holds up so well. The case is still great condition, and the stone bags have a little wear and tear but nothing major. In addition, the stones and board show some signs of use; but they are still working magnificently.<br />
<strong>Usabil­ity:</strong> Absolutely no complaints. The board flattens out with relative ease, and the stones* cling to the board rather well. (In one of the shots below, you&#8217;ll see that I have the board upside down and nothing falls off). In addition, putting everything back in the case is actually really easy. Since the bags that are carrying the stones are made with fabric, they conform to the shape of the case with a relative ease when you shake it a bit. And if you&#8217;re wondering about how the strap works in terms of slinging it over your back, it works fantastic.<br />
Considering how much this costs, this is honestly one of the best value items that exists on the entire go market. I could go on about how awesome this product is, but bottom line: unless you want a portable set made of actual stones and wood, this is hands down the best portable go set out there.<br />
<em>*Some people say that the stones are &#8220;too small,&#8221; but let&#8217;s be fair people, this is a portable set. If you want full sized stones, go and lug your stones and bowls. </em></p>

<h3>Detailed Review</h3>
<p>This was my first set of real go equipment. When it arrived, I was happier than a child on a shopping spree at a toy store. And so, you can imagine how happy I was to see that my order was packaged very well. Here are some shots of the package:<br />
<a href="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2013/03/gosetbox.jpg"><img class="aligncenter" alt="gosetbox" src="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2013/03/gosetbox.jpg?resize=300%2C225" width="300" height="225" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><br />
<figure id="attachment_2402" style="width: 300px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2013/03/gosetbox2.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2402" alt="gosetbox2" src="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2013/03/gosetbox2.jpg?resize=300%2C225" width="300" height="225" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">As you can see, the contents inside are very well protected.</figcaption></figure>
Everything arrived in great condition. The only issue I had was that some of the black stones were missing from the set. So I contacted <a href="http://www.ymimports.com/">YMImports</a> that very day, and received a response within 12 hours notifying me that they would send replacement stones. Way to live up to your reputation of great customer service <a href="https://www.ymimports.com/">YMImports</a>!<br />

</ul>
<p>The set as a whole is an incredible value. Unless you are looking to specifically buy a floor board, portable board, or another kind of stone (e.g., slate and shell), this the best deal that you&#8217;re going to find.</p>
