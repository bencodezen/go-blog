				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As much as I hate to do this, BenGoZen will be on hiatus for the rest of the month to prepare for a brand new blog redesign. I am currently working really hard to not only implement a brand new look and feel for the blog, but I&#8217;m also completely revising and improving the information architecture and content quality to make the entire experience more enjoyable and worthy of your time!<br />
To get you excited for some of the new changes coming in a week, here are some things you can expect to see!</p>
<ol>
<li>Subscribe via email and RSS with ease!</li>
<li>Eidogo Player back in full functionality so that you no longer have to leave the blog to see my games!</li>
<li>Easy translator widget that will allow you to view my content in many languages! (Although I won&#8217;t be able to verify fully the accuracy of the translation, the content will now be available to more people!)</li>
<li>New integrated comment system that will allow you to login from various social media avenues.</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Looking forward to seeing you on the grand opening &#8211; Halloween, October 31st, 2012!</strong></p>
