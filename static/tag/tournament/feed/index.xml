This past weekend I had the pleasure of attending the NOVA Pumpkin Classic Tournament and seeing many friends there. And though I originally planned on playing in the tournament that day, I ended up being on call for work and thus planned on only attending to see friends and show my support.<br />
Upon arrival though, I got convinced to play in the first round since we had even numbers. And while I would have liked to have played for more rounds, it was simply not possible for me to do so with a possible work call coming at any moment.<br />
On the upside, I did get to play a round against an opponent I had played against in the Baduk Open Championship. I had decided to self-promote to 1k this time and was giving her a 2 stone handicap. The following is the game record (which I will be sure to review in a future Monday Go Meditation).<br />

<p>Though I am a little sad I was not able to stay for the whole day, it was great being able to see everyone. An especially big shoutout goes to the Stafford Go community: Robbie, Anderson, and Ramon for being there and sharing a great lunch with me.<br />
Other than that, I’ve been adhering to my training schedule without fail thus far. And though I had some initial plans for ramping up content production here on the blog, it’ll have to wait a bit as I am in the process of sorting through things. No worries though, you can still expect to see the usual here. Just don’t expect any new weekly columns in the near future. Haha.<br />
With that said, for all those who celebrate Halloween, wishing you all a spectacular Halloween full of fun and candy!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 style="text-align: center;">Introduction</h2>
<p>With this week, we continue on with Game #4 of Maaike&#8217;s <a title="Maaike's April Challenge" href="http://www.thegochallenge.blogspot.com.au/2014/04/april-challenge.html">April Challenge</a>, which also happens to be the first round of the <a title="1st Washington Open Baduk Championship — Part I" href="//1st-washington-open-baduk-championship-part/">1st Washington Open Baduk Championship</a> that I participated in a month or so ago. Though it ended up being a completely crazy roller coaster of a match, it is an excellent example of how volatile games can be in tournaments. Because of the pressure of competition, players will look for any slack move or advantage they can to reverse the game. With that said, hang on to your seats cause this is going to be a bumpy one!<br />

<p style="text-align: center;">In a tournament game, you almost always want to play till the end. You never know if your opponent might crack under the pressure.</p>

<figure id="attachment_5198" style="width: 500px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/washingbadukopenpart2-01.png"><img class=" wp-image-5198" alt="washingbadukopenpart2-01" src="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/washingbadukopenpart2-01.png?resize=500%2C375" width="500" height="375" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Hikaru No Go, Kuwabara Hon’inbo (Epsiode 29)</figcaption></figure>
When I woke up the next day, I felt like a brand new person. I know that I could have been like a lot of other players who would have recalled the performance from the first day and felt sorry for themselves, but the the experience I had watching Park Sohyun (3p) play the night before had struck me and really opened my eyes.<br />
I was running a little late that morning, and ended up getting there around 9:35am. According to the schedule, I was already late and so I half-expected to find everyone already playing their games and my clock already running. However, it seemed like I wasn&#8217;t the only one running late because the pairings hadn&#8217;t even been put up when I arrived.<br />
After catching up with some people though, the roster was finally put up. As I scanned the list, I found my opponent: a 5 kyu. He would be taking Black and I was giving him no handicap.<br />
My opponent was 5 kyu and I wasn&#8217;t giving him a handicap. Had it been yesterday, I probably would have been frustrated that I was &#8220;demoted;&#8221; but I was past those stupid egotistical thoughts today.<br />
As I sat down in front of my opponent, I was very clear on what I was going to do: I was going to try and play like Sohyun did the night before. It was going to be strong and interesting go. That&#8217;s the go I would play. Below is the kifu. (The commentary version will be Monday Go Meditation: Game 63)<br />

<p style="text-align: left;">It was an exciting game, but one that I felt far more in control of than any of the games previously. When my opponent resigned, I let out a sigh of relief. &#8220;Yes.&#8221; I thought, &#8220;At least I&#8217;m now 2-2. And to top it off, I&#8217;m feeling a hell of a lot better than yesterday.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">After Round 4, Myung Wan Kim (9p) and I grabbed our bento boxes (unfortunately I didn&#8217;t take a photo this time, but I got the <a title="Galbi Wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galbi">galbi</a> one) and I took him back to the hotel so he could rest / work on other things (since there was a few hours gap before he had to be back).</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">When I dropped him off, he asked me to pick him up around 3:10pm. So when I arrived back at the tournament, I looked at the time.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">&#8220;1:00pm is when Round 5 starts,&#8221; I thought, &#8220;And assuming my game takes even just the main time alone, I would be over time and late picking up Myung.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">With my record at 2-2, I seriously debated not playing in the 5th round and taking a buy. After all, 2-2 isn&#8217;t a bad record to end the tournament with right?</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">A good part of this was my insecurity at the prospects of possibly ending the tournament with a record of 2-3 and losing the final round, but I realized quickly that it was stupid. I decided to simply play in the 5th Round, and if push came to shove, I would resign the game if it took too long because I wanted to make sure I would pick up Myung on time.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Before I knew it, the fifth round pairings were up. My opponent was a 4 kyu that I knew from the area. There would be no handicap and I was taking white. Below are the results of the my final game for the tournament. (The commentary version will be Monday Go Meditation: Game 64)</p>

<p>When the game was coming close to the end, time was also drawing near as well. It was around 2:30pm when I had begun my final hunt to kill the group on the top; but my opponent still had plenty of time left on his clock, so I couldn&#8217;t fault him for trying to take the time to make sure he was really dead. However, with time drawing close, I began mentally preparing myself to resign and simply be satisfied with the game that I had played.<br />
As you might imagine, I breathed a sigh of relief and thanked my lucky stars when he resigned. &#8220;Hoorah!&#8221; I thought, &#8221; I still can go pickup Myung with time to spare!&#8221; And with that, I went to report my results and went off to pick him up.<br />
When we got back, there was still some time to spare before the remaining festivities began (i.e., lecture and simul games). This was perfect however, because  I was able to spend some time talking with Sohyun (since she had been running in and out and busy with other obligations). We went over my game in Round 5, and I even got her to sign a book that she had given me the night before.<br />
<figure id="attachment_5206" style="width: 358px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/haengmaBook.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-5206" alt="haengmaBook" src="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/haengmaBook-768x1024.jpg?resize=358%2C477" width="358" height="477" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">It&#8217;s a Korean book on haengma (i.e., stone movement). Best souvenir from the event!</figcaption></figure>
As we wrapped up one of our conversations, a fellow Korean player had come by; so she had the idea to give both of us a simul game while we were waiting for everything to start (which was incredibly kind of her). I decided to play an even game with her since I wanted to feel the full power of her skills.<br />
Unfortunately we were only able to play about 20 or so moves before she was summoned to play the official simul games scheduled for the event. However, what I will say about the game was that even in that series of short exchanges, it was quite an experience to watch her start dismantling what I thought was a good position.<br />
With all the games finished, they had the following activities going on simultaneously:<br />
(1) Myung Wan Kim (9p) reviewing one of Andy Liu&#8217;s (1p) game from the tournament.<br />

<p>When they announced the first place prize for the Kyu D division, &#8220;&#8230; 1st Place, trophy and $100&#8221; echoed over the microphone. As I heard the cash prize amount, I&#8217;d be lying if I said that part of me didn&#8217;t feel just a twinge of jealously as I heard the cash prize amount. After all, it wasn&#8217;t chump change by any stretch of the means!<br />
As I sat there listening to them announce the winners, I recalled the time that I had won first place in the <a title="NOVA Pumpkin Classic Tournament 2012 — Conclusion" href="//nova-pumpkin-classic-tournament-2012-conclusion/">Pumpkin Classic</a>. I smiled as I remembered that momentous feeling. And a small part of me wished that I had done better in the tournament; but then I reminded myself that I had nothing to be ashamed of for this tournament. After all, on top managing to bring my record up to 3-2, the experiences and the lessons that I had learned through this tournament were priceless and I would not have traded it in for a better record or any trophy or prize money.<br />
&#8220;Kyu A Division (1-5k),&#8221; echoed over the microphone.<br />
My attention returned to the present as I thought.  &#8220;Oo&#8230; I wonder who won my division.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>&#8212; let&#8217;s pause and let&#8217;s rewind the clock for a sec &#8212;</em></p>
<p>Earlier when I had been walking around, I had heard the tournament directors talking about how the kyu divisions did not have any people who won 4 games except for one person. (I later found out it was Bob Crites who had been performing well in tournaments recently.)<br />
A part of me became hopeful at that thought that maybe I was still in the running for something, but then I brushed the notion aside as I recalled that I had not exactly played my best consistently in the tournament.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>&#8212; return to present moment &#8212;</em></p>
<p>&#8220;3rd Place &#8211; Weixin Wang, 4k &#8211; $50 and a trophy&#8221;<br />
*applause and multiple cameras taking photos going off*<br />
&#8220;Huh,&#8221; I thought, &#8220;That&#8217;s the guy I lost to in the 3rd round. If he got third place, then I&#8217;m most definitely out of the running now.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;2nd Place &#8211; John Zhao, 3k &#8211; $100 and a trophy&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Wait,&#8221; I thought, &#8220;That&#8217;s the guy I beat in the 1st round. Maybe I still have a shot?&#8221;<br />
As I&#8217;m sitting there bewildered and trying to make sense of how the tiebreakers might actually work, the microphone echoes again:<br />
&#8220;1st Place &#8211; Benjamin Hong&#8230;&#8221;<br />
<figure id="attachment_5208" style="width: 347px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/05/omgcat.gif"><img class="size-full wp-image-5208" alt="Wait...

I honestly wish someone had taken a picture of my face, because I can tell you that I was completely and utterly surprised. But yeah, I wasn&#8217;t hallucinating or imaging things. I really did get 1st place.<br />
<figure style="width: 448px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/05/2014-WOpen-22.jpg"><img class=" " alt="2014-WOpen-22" src="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/05/2014-WOpen-22.jpg?resize=448%2C298" width="448" height="298" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">There&#8217;s my first prize envelope.

Looks pretty sweet!</figcaption></figure>
The thing about tournaments is that you never know what&#8217;s going to happen. I went the first day with a 1-2 record and completely thought I was out of the running. In fact, I even thought about dropping out the last round because of stupid insecurities. Imagine if I had done that? Imagine if I had just given up? The story would not have been nearly as exciting would it?<br />
Though I am very grateful that I got 1st place, I really believe that this tournament will forever go down as one of the pinnacle moments in my journey as a go player. The experiences and things that I learned about myself through the trials and tribulations are ones that I will forever remember fondly and I look forward to continue building on them.<br />
Many thanks also goes out to Keith, Gary, Andy, Todd, Alan, the Korean Baduk Association and many others for making this tournament a huge success. And of course, special thanks goes out to <a title="SmartGo Official Site" href="https://www.smartgo.com/">SmartGo</a> for its awesome iPad app that serves as my trusty sidekick for recording my games.<br />
Finally, a huge thanks goes out to Myung Wan Kim (9p) and Park Sohyun (3p) for making this tournament an unforgettable experience and providing guidance when I really needed it!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center;"><a title="1st Washington Open Baduk Championship — Part I" href="//1st-washington-open-baduk-championship-part/">Part I</a> &#8211; <strong>Interlude</strong> &#8211; <a title="1st Washington Open Baduk Championship — Part II" href="//1st-washington-open-baduk-championship-part-ii/">Part II</a></p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Weekly Go Wednesday, Issue #38</h2>
<p>Though some of you may hate me for delaying Part II of my <a title="1st Washington Open Baduk Championship — Part I" href="//1st-washington-open-baduk-championship-part/">1st Washington Open Baduk Championship</a> series, the funny thing is that the Weekly Go Wednesday series actually fits in perfectly with the story. So hold your horses for one more day, and let&#8217;s dive right into this shall we?<br />
So where were we? Ah yes. I had finished off the <a title="1st Washington Open Baduk Championship — Part I" href="//1st-washington-open-baduk-championship-part/">first day of the tournament</a> with the second to worst record you can have: 1 win with 2 loss. To compound on that embarrassment, I won one and then proceeded to lose each game afterwards with each being a more epic failure than the last. After all, it would have been way better if I had lost the first two games and then won the last one. Then at least I could feel like I improved over the day instead of the epic plummet that actually happened.<br />
Usually when I undergo a shocking disappointment like I did that day, my first reaction is to try and figure out what went wrong. After all, it wasn&#8217;t as if some freak accident happened where I hallucinated and put the stones in the wrong place. No, especially with go, there are no such things. So for the rest of the day, I kept thinking about what went wrong. Many things crossed my mind&#8230;<br />
<span id="more-5141"></span><br />
The first (and most self-pitying) of my thoughts was the simple fact that I wasn&#8217;t actually 3 kyu. KGS and the AGA might have ranked me as 3 kyu, but maybe the statistics were biased and overly generous since I did not play often enough to get an accurate measurement of my strength. So perhaps I was really more like 4-5 kyu when it came to the competitive scene. But after trying to entertain that thought a bit longer, even I realized how absurd that notion was.<br />
Since that wasn&#8217;t it, the next thing that I came up with was the fact that I lacked the stamina to survive tournaments. In other words, I might be able to play one serious game a day and then a few casual ones; but in a tournament setting with all the pressure and intensity, I ran out of steam and could barely win one game. After all, I had stopped playing ranked games (aka serious games with strangers) and was probably more out of practice than I was willing to admit at the time.<br />
Okay. That made sense, but I concluded that it could not be the only reason. After all, being tired doesn&#8217;t explain the self-destruction that occurred as the day went on. After all, it&#8217;s not as if I just made a few bad reading mistakes, it&#8217;s like my brain decided to take a vacation and I was playing like a mad man. So there must be more&#8230;<br />
Ah. Could a part of it be arrogance from the fact that the last full tournament I played in (<a title="NOVA Pumpkin Classic Tournament 2012 — Introduction" href="//nova-pumpkin-class-2012-intro/">NOVA Pumpkin Classic</a>) resulted in me have a perfect record and getting 1st place? And in hindsight, I had not really prepared for that tournament, so perhaps I subconsciously thought that this tournament might be similar. Maybe I could just wing it and do well like last time. Not necessarily win, but at least do well. You know?<br />
<span style="line-height: 1.5em;">Well, that was about how far I got with my introspection when I arrived in a nearby conference room to see Park Sohyun (3p) playing a teaching game with one of the VIPs.*</span><br />
<em>*To give some background on this story though, the VIP she was playing a teaching game with was actually an insei when he was younger. So while he was older now and out of practice, there was no doubt in my mind that he was pretty strong (i.e., he only took 2 stones for the game).</em><br />
<figure id="attachment_5164" style="width: 420px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014-WOpen-10.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-5164" alt="2014-WOpen-10" src="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014-WOpen-10.jpg?resize=420%2C560" width="420" height="560" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">I didn&#8217;t want to take a picture of her from the front at this time because I didn&#8217;t get a chance to ask if it would be okay and she was in a middle of the game.</figcaption></figure>
They would play for like 30-40 moves, and then he would have a question for her and they would rewind the game back like 20 moves or clear off an area of the board to talk about a particular sequence or concept. And then the game would resume another 30-40 moves before the same thing happened again.<br />
I could not understand anything they were talking about since they spoke in Korean. However,as I watched the game unfold, I would watch as her moves exuded with power as they came down on the board. And at the same time, I watched as the VIP tried his best to hold his ground against her while ending up with this very over concentrated groups that she would harass while continuing to gain a greater advantage on the board with each move.<br />
The weird thing is that it&#8217;s not as if I had never met a professional or seen a professional play against an amateur before. Yet for some reason, her moves captivated me in a way I had never quite felt before. As I watched in awe, each and every move came flowing down with a grace and beauty that I can only describe as surreal.<br />

<p style="text-align: center;"><a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014-WOpen-01.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-5155" alt="2014-WOpen-01" src="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014-WOpen-01.jpg?resize=576%2C247" width="576" height="247" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Hey everyone! Welcome to Part I of my awesome experience at the 1st Washington Open Baduk Championship this past weekend! Though many of you already know the results of the tournament, I&#8217;ll start by asking you all to refrain from commenting on the actual result till Part II since some don&#8217;t know yet.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">In addition, I&#8217;m sure that many of you are eager to see what kind of games I played, so I have gone ahead and uploaded the kifu for your enjoyment. Commentary will come in future Monday Go Meditations (which I will note for each game); but hopefully you will forgive me for not being to add commentary within such a short time.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">With that said, let&#8217;s get started!</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span id="more-5140"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">To start, even though the tournament officially started on Saturday, I had the pleasure of getting to hangout and spend time with Myung Wang Kim (9p) and Park Sohyun (3p) on Friday. (In case some of you didn&#8217;t know, I got to know Myung at the <a title="North American Go Convention — Day 2" href="//north-american-go-convention-day-2/">North American Go Convention</a> last year.) After letting them do some exploring, we got dinner at a nearby Korean restaurant with some distinguished guests and ate delicious food.*</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><em>*Many thanks to our gracious hosts for footing the bill that night. It was a wonderful meal and was full of great conversation and great company.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Around the time dinner was wrapping up, I noticed that some of the guests were speaking to Myung in Korean. It seemed as if they were inviting him somewhere, and I was a little sad at the prospect of having to part ways so early in the evening; but to my great surprise, Myung then turned to me and asked if I would be interested in going with them to the local Korean baduk club?</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Me? Interested in visiting a local Korean baduk club? Absolutely!</p>
<figure id="attachment_5156" style="width: 448px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014-WOpen-02.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-5156" alt="2014-WOpen-02" src="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014-WOpen-02.jpg?resize=448%2C448" width="448" height="448" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Here&#8217;s a shot of the inside of the club. I refrained from taking any direct pictures of people playing since I didn&#8217;t want anyone feeling uncomfortable from me doing so.</figcaption></figure>
<p style="text-align: left;">When we walked into the club, it was amazing for me to see so many gorgeous boards and bowls sitting in one room. And to top it off, there were people playing! So cool! Granted, they all spoke Korean with one another so I was rather lost when it came to what they were talking about. However, it was nice to just bask in the atmosphere and while hearing the pleasant sound of the stones clicking on the board.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">After some time, we said our goodbyes and I took them back to their hotel so that they could rest since we had to be up early the next day.</p>
<figure id="attachment_5157" style="width: 358px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014-WOpen-03.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-5157" alt="2014-WOpen-03" src="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014-WOpen-03.jpg?resize=358%2C478" width="358" height="478" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">This was the banner you were greeted with when you walked out of the elevator.</figcaption></figure>
<p style="text-align: left;">Before I knew it, the momentous day had arrived. It was officially the first day of the 1st Washing Open Baduk Championship!</p>
<figure id="attachment_5158" style="width: 512px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014-WOpen-04.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-5158" alt="2014-WOpen-04" src="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014-WOpen-04.jpg?resize=512%2C384" width="512" height="384" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Look at all the people registering! And I got there pretty early too!</figcaption></figure>
When I arrived in the lobby for registration, I was pleasantly surprised to see so many people waiting in line! &#8220;Hoorah!&#8221; I thought, &#8220;Hopefully this will help convince the sponsors* to continue doing this again next year!&#8221;<br />
<em>*In case you didn&#8217;t know, this tournament was being hosted and sponsored by a number of Korean companies (you can see their logos above in the first banner) and featured a number of awesome perks like free entry fee, free lunch on both days, and even cash prizes).</em><br />
<figure id="attachment_5159" style="width: 512px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014-WOpen-05.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-5159" alt="2014-WOpen-05" src="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014-WOpen-05.jpg?resize=512%2C384" width="512" height="384" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">The sight of a room full of gobans and stones with people playing / discussing variations is always a great joy.</figcaption></figure>
<p style="text-align: left;">When I arrived in the playing room, I was also glad to already see a number of people already sitting and getting acclimated to the area. And as you can see, we were adequately prepared for a large number of players!</p>
<figure id="attachment_5160" style="width: 410px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014-WOpen-06.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-5160" alt="2014-WOpen-06" src="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014-WOpen-06.jpg?resize=410%2C546" width="410" height="546" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Here&#8217;s the schedule for both days. And if you&#8217;re wondering what&#8217;s in the upper right, they had Wi-Fi for everyone as well (which was awesome if I may say so myself).</figcaption></figure>
After a bit of waiting and catching up with various friends, the pairings were finally up. It was the fateful moment that you either dread or wait with anticipation when any tournament rolls around: the first round! The game that will set the stage for the rest of the tournament!<br />
My opponent was an older Chinese man who might have been in his fifties to sixties. He was a 3 kyu and the game was set as even with White getting 7.5 komi. The time settings were 1 hour main time per person with 20 moves per 5 minutes byoyomi.<br />
After exchanging customary greetings and fussing with the clocks for a bit, we started our game. The kifu below is our game. (The commentary version will be Monday Go Meditation: Game 60)<br />

<p style="text-align: left;">Though the game ended up being dramatic, I will have to say that I tried to play a calm and patient game as much as I could. (The idea originates from <a title="Maaike's April Challenge" href="http://www.thegochallenge.blogspot.com.au/2014/04/april-challenge.html">Maaike&#8217;s April Challenge</a>). As you saw, I ended up letting an advantageous position turn into a complete disaster. It was only by sheer patience and luck that I was able to turn it around. The game was one of the longest ones that round. It took more than two hours for us to finish and I used 3 periods of overtime.* Needless to say I was relieved to win, but I was exhausted afterwards as I went off to grab lunch.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><em>*On a side note, I just wanted to rant about how chess clocks are AWFUL for Canadian byoyomi because you end up spending more time trying to figure out whether the flag is about to tip instead of focusing on your move. So you end up playing super fast moves for fear of losing on time. Stressful I tell you!</em></p>

There was a variety of things: rice, korean noodle with some vegetables, potato salad, kimchi, bean sprouts, tempura shrimp, and a couple of other things. Very filling!</figcaption></figure>
Once everyone had eaten lunch, we had our opening ceremony (which seems a little backwards since the event already started, but it was necessary because the VIP guests could not arrive earlier).<br />
<figure id="attachment_5162" style="width: 512px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014-WOpen-08.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-5162" alt="2014-WOpen-08" src="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014-WOpen-08.jpg?resize=512%2C384" width="512" height="384" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">You can see them giving speeches up front and everyone being respectful and listening.</figcaption></figure>
After the ceremony was done, it was time for Round 2. My opponent this time was a Chinese woman in her forties to fifties and a 2 kyu. Since I won the first round though, there would be no handicap and White would still get 7.5 points.*<br />
<em>*In AGA tournaments, it seems that they calculate handicaps not based on rank but on your performance in the tournament as it progresses. </em><br />
Before the game started, I decided I would continue to try and play a calm game. The kifu below is the result. (The commentary version will be Monday Go Meditation: Game 61)<br />

<p style="text-align: left;">To be honest, I thought that I was ahead for most of the game. I thought I had done a good job securing territory and keeping White&#8217;s territory small. However, I never actually counted and only did rough estimations.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">My game took long as usual (though not as long as the first round) and there were a few people watching my game when it came time to counting. To my shock and disappointment (though probably not to your surprise), I was actually behind by 20+ points. My opponent was kind enough to try and say I was very strong and that she thought she was losing, but the defeat stung still stung quite a bit.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">After the game, I did my best to try and pick myself back up. After all, it&#8217;s just one loss right? My record was 1-1 now. No big deal. Just brush it off and play better the next round. However, Round 3 was upon me before I knew it (since there was no real break between the rounds).</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">At the end of the last round, I mentioned that there were a few people watching towards the end. One of those was the gentleman that I would end up playing this round. He was also a Chinese man in his forties to fifties and was a 4 kyu. In this game however, I would receive give him a 1 stone handicap and only got 0.5 komi. The kifu below is our game. (The commentary version will be Monday Go Meditation: Game 62)</p>

<p>It was an awful game. My stamina had already been spent with the first round. So with that and the fact that I was still rattled by my loss in Round 2, I could not keep calm and played one of the worst games I&#8217;ve played to date. Complete overplays and getting into fights I had no business getting into.<br />
Resigning within 100 moves&#8230; My record was now 1-2&#8230; Needless to say, I was upset and really disappointed with myself.<br />
After the game, I took Myung back to the hotel so he could get some rest before the lecture that night. We talked some in the car and I was given a lot to think about. I then went off to eat dinner by myself before it was time to pick him up again.<br />
<figure id="attachment_5163" style="width: 512px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014-WOpen-09.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-5163" alt="2014-WOpen-09" src="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014-WOpen-09.jpg?resize=512%2C384" width="512" height="384" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Unfortunately I only got one shot of Myung during his lecture, but I guess it&#8217;s better than nothing. (Would have preferred to have gotten one when there were stones on the board, but I was too focused on the lecture to remember to take another one.)</figcaption></figure>
After picking him up, we went back to the convention and Myung lectured on a joseki that had recently been created by young Korean professionals. A lot of it went over my head, but it was very cool to see how go is constantly evolving and changing.<br />
Once the lecture was finished, the crowd dispersed into different groups. A blitz tournament was about to start. And though I had originally planned on participating, I was not feeling up to it and decided not to. After all, today had been a rather disturbing revelation of the limitations of my go. I played one decent game and then proceeded to crash and burn&#8230;<br />
Earlier during the lecture, I had seen Park Sohyun (3p) come in and then leave the room with one of the VIP with a board and stones. While some people went up to ask Myung some questions, I decided to go check and see what she was up to. As I prepared to walk around, the following quotation from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/First-Kyu-Sung-Hwa-Hong/dp/0964479699">First Kyu</a> popped in my head:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;First kyu, a player of the first rank? Really? Have you ever competed in a professional qualifying tournament? No? Then you are not, I repeat NOT first kyu!<br />
I know I know. Nowadays all kinds of bad players call themselves first kyu.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8220;Maybe I&#8217;m just a fake 3 kyu,&#8221; I thought as I walked to find her, &#8220;Perhaps I was too naive and arrogant in thinking I could compete, let alone win, as a 3 kyu&#8230;&#8221;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 style="text-align: left;">Overview</h2>
<p>After trying to go through my training regimen from last week, I realized I was getting bored of practicing the same problems over and over again. And while my intentions were good (since my goal was to make all the problems instinctive), interest and motivation trumps that so I&#8217;ve moved on to more interesting topics to change it up for now. And especially after giving thought to the notion that <a title="WGW37: Tesuji More Useful Than Tsumego?" href="//wgw37-tesuji-more-useful-than-tsumego/">tesuji is more important than life and death</a>, I really wanted to start studying tesuji once again.<br />
On another note, in case anyone missed it, the <a title="Nova Go Club Tournaments Website" href="http://www.novagoclub.org/tournaments">Washington Open</a> is happening this weekend. Yours truly will be attending and competing/participating in whatever I can do. So you can definitely look forward to a series of posts on the event. I&#8217;m a little nervous because I haven&#8217;t really been playing as much as I should have, but I&#8217;ll have to brush that aside and just go to have as much fun as I can. If I can play really interesting games, then I will consider this event to be a success. See you all next week!<br />

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I recently finished <em>Master Play: The Style of Go Seigen</em> (Review coming soon!), and it has really given me a lot to think about in regards to the way I play go.<br />
For starters, though I&#8217;ve been familiar with the concept of professionals ignoring an area when there just aren&#8217;t any good moves to play, it wasn&#8217;t until I saw Go Seigen&#8217;s games till I realized how true this really was. In fact, not only did Go Seigen constantly resist giving in to his opponents; but he would also not hesitate to trade large sections of the board! And what made it even more mind-blowing, was that these areas he would sacrifice were places that were only a few moves away from solid territory!<br />
With that vivid illustration in mind, I couldn&#8217;t help but start to notice how stubborn kyu players get about hanging onto stones or territory. It&#8217;s as if once they&#8217;ve made a decision (i.e., I have declared the right side to be mine!), they will defend it to the end regardless of the fact that they are losing. Another example of this is I&#8217;ve noticed is: &#8220;Oh look, I&#8217;ve spent the time to play three stones here, even though they are now strategically useless, I must save it at all cost even though I will let my opponent walk right into my territory!&#8221; Granted, I realize that you must understand strategy and such to be able to walk away from some groups, but this seems to be a general trend that I&#8217;ve noticed.<br />
In addition, I think I may have started to internalize the idea of, &#8220;If you can&#8217;t find a good move, play somewhere else.&#8221; In other words, seeing Go Seigen&#8217;s game for the first time has really shocked me into realizing how much freedom there really is on the go board. Although a sequence might be considered sente or an area might seem large, it may not actually be from a whole board perspective or from another player&#8217;s strategy.<br />
I keep trying to bring this post to a nice closing statement, but it seems that this post is destined for random ramblings. It&#8217;s still a whirlwind of thoughts and emotions that I&#8217;m sorting through, but I guess that&#8217;s one of the benefits of having a blog right? A way for me to dump my thoughts and attempt to sort it out in the process. xD<br />

On an entirely different note, in case you haven&#8217;t heard about it, the <a href="http://www.usgo.org/">American Go Association (AGA)</a> has taken a big step towards establishing a presence online. Starting in October, there will be an <a href="http://www.usgo.org/news/2013/09/expanding-online-efforts-aga-launches-on-line-self-paired-tourney-on-kgs/">AGA Online Tournament</a> that will be used to help gather information and help them figure out the right way to proceed with online games in the future. And yes, I have already signed up!

It was a beautiful Saturday morning when I pulled up to the <a title="40th Maryland Open — Go Tournament!" href="//40th-maryland-open-go-tournament/">Maryland Open</a> in Catonsville, Maryland. Though I was a little nervous for what was waiting for me at this tournament, I was excited at the prospect of seeing friends and having a day filled with go.<br />
<span id="more-2803"></span><br />
After registering (as AGA 5k) and catching up with a few people, I noticed that a girl (whom I&#8217;d never seen before) come up to the registration table to purchase the books she had in hand (two Elementary Go Series books).</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Wait. There are go books on sale here?!</em></p>
<figure id="attachment_2806" style="width: 300px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2013/05/roadrunner.gif"><img class=" wp-image-2806 " alt="Credit to Tumblr" src="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2013/05/roadrunner.gif?resize=300%2C226" width="300" height="226" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Credit to <a href="http://www.tumblr.com/tagged/road%20runner">Tumblr</a></figcaption></figure>
When I found the section of go books for sale, I couldn&#8217;t believe my eyes as I stared at possibly the largest collection and variety of go books I had ever seen all in one place&#8230; It was like I was a kid in a candy store.<br />
<figure id="attachment_2822" style="width: 300px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2013/05/kermitexcited.gif"><img class=" wp-image-2822 " alt="Credit to Tumblr" src="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2013/05/kermitexcited.gif?resize=300%2C162" width="300" height="162" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Credit to <a href="http://www.tumblr.com/tagged/excited%20gif">Tumblr</a></figcaption></figure>
It&#8217;s safe to say that I spent the next 20 minutes or so perusing over just about every book I&#8217;d ever been remotely interested in. Granted, I&#8217;m trying to be better about spending money on go; but all of that went to hell when I found books that were out of print. With some restraint, I ended up only purchasing:</p>
<ol>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="line-height: 13px;">Improve Your Intuition, Volume 3</span></span></li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The ABC&#8217;s of Attack and Defense</span></li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Cosmic Go</span> (Not out of print but I liked the writing style and decided to get it to further my study of handicap go)</li>
</ol>
<p>Once I was finished buying my books, I returned to socializing with my friends since I knew that spending any more time in the book section would probably result in me buying more books. Shortly after though, the pairings were up and it was time the first round of the day.<br />
As my opponent and I sat across from one another, I saw him pull out his Bose headphones in preparation for the game. In the past, I had never considered listening to music while playing go; but I decided right there and then that I would give it a shot as well. Here&#8217;s the game from the first round.<a href="//wp-content/uploads/2013/05/2013-05-25-MD-Open-2013-Game-1.sgf"><br />

<p>After that intense match, we all headed out for lunch at a nearby Korean supermarket. I got sushi and enjoyed someone&#8217;s miso soup while we talked all sorts of interesting topics (e.g., Steven&#8217;s experience in Japan with shabu-shabu, the metro station in Japan, etc.).  Before I knew it though, it was time for the second round. The only problem was that my opponent was nowhere to be found.<br />
At this time, I was actually quite comfortable with the idea of my opponent not showing. The first round had given me a lot to think about and I was happy to simply watch other games instead of playing. Sure enough though, about ten minutes later my opponent came in ready to play. Here is the game record for the second round.<a href="//wp-content/uploads/2013/05/2013-05-25-MD-Open-2013-Game-2.sgf"><br />

<p>Unfortunately, I was unable to stay in the third round or attend the second day of the tournament, so my story ends here. However, even though I would have been curious to see how I would have done in the tournament, it was a fun filled day where I got to meet a lot of great people and play some great go. No regrets on my part. =)<br />
Big shoutout to Eulerstotl, Yuki, Steven, Gurujeet, Todd, Keith, Josh and Justin! It was great seeing you all there!</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">With the North American Go Convention over, I must admit that I miss the excitement of knowing I was going to be spending the evening or day immersed in go and hanging out with great company. Nonetheless, let us recap what&#8217;s happened over the last five days:</p>
<ol>
<li>Attended two professional lectures.</li>
<li><span style="line-height: 13px;">Played 6 simultaneous games with professionals.</span></li>
<li>Managed to actually win one of my simul games.</li>
</ol>
<p>Below is a close-up of all the autographs on the fan and the related games that I played.<br />

<p style="text-align: center;"><a title="North American Go Convention — Day 5" href="//north-american-go-convention-day-5/">Game 1</a></p>
<p>Although it would have been great to play in the tournament, I felt that my time was spent really well on pro events. Tempering myself for battle is something I can do on my own, while attending pro events of this quantity is a whole different matter. I really do think that the time I spent at the NAGC has really helped to get me out of my rut and bring newfound motivation towards go.<br />
Overall, it was a fantastic experience that I would not have traded for the world. Not only did I learn so much and acquire a renewed motivation towards of go; but most importantly, I made some great friends and had a really fun time.<br />
I hope that you&#8217;ve enjoyed this series and hope to see you at a convention some day!</p>

<p>For my final day at the NAGC, I woke up a little later since I was pretty tired from the past four days. After all, on top of all the go and staying out late, I had been working as well. So when I found out that the first round was starting at 8:30am, I decided to forgo competing all together and just get there later for the pro events.<br />
When I arrived, it was approximately 9:15am. As I looked at the schedule for the day, I noticed that the pro events were once again scheduled during the second half of each round. In addition, there were no breaks in between the rounds. If you wanted lunch or dinner, you had better hope your match ends early. So in short, trying to compete, have your meals, and attend pro events would nearly kill you.<br />
Since the first pro event was starting at 10;00am, I went ahead and walked upstairs to see how the tournament was progressing. You can imagine my surprise when I arrived at the playing room to find that they needed another player since someone didn&#8217;t show up. Since there was still some time before the match and I felt bad that someone was missing an opponent, I decided to go ahead and play to help out. Since there was only 30 minutes before the pro event though, I tried to play as quickly as I could with the most aggressive method possible so that the game could possibly end early.<br />
<span id="more-1934"></span><br />
Like I predicted, there was no chance of us finishing the game before the pro event. And to be honest, I can&#8217;t blame my opponent for wanting to take his time to see if he could actually manage to live. With the amount of fighting left to do, I would even be willing to bet that we still had a good 30 &#8211; 45 minutes left before we were close to finishing. So when the time came, there was no choice to resign. Below is the game record.<br />

<p>I will admit that I part of me wanted to see how the game might&#8217;ve ended, but I knew I was playing a rather high risk approach and could very well have lost anyways. So all in all, I was happy to give my opponent the win since I wasn&#8217;t going to win any awards anyways. =D<br />
When the time came from the simul game with Myung, as one might expect with the schedule that day, I was the only one who showed up. So, in order to try and make things for interesting for him, we decided to do a 9 stone handicap where I could put the stones anywhere I wanted.<br />
At first, I set up a setting relatively similar to your standard 9 stone handicap formation with a chance in regards to using a Chinese opening; but then Myung suggested it might be better for me to secure a couple of corners to begin with. I think he soon regretted his suggestion however, because when he looked at the board again and was about to play his first move, he said, &#8220;Oh man&#8230; this is going to make it a lot harder.&#8221;<br />

<p>When I played that final move, you have no idea the relief and rush of excitement I felt when I heard him say, &#8220;Oh! Good! You saw that!&#8221; and then put down his stone and focus his attention on the three players who had come in after we had started. So while my 9 stone handicap was a free placement style, this was a huge moment for me because I actually managed to win against a professional. It helped to renew my confidence in myself to feel growth over the past five days.<br />
Afterwards, Myung and I went to pick up James and grabbed lunch at Cosi&#8217;s. We had fun talking about all sorts of random things, but tennis was a pretty big topic and it was fun finding out their different styles and such. I had no idea that there are certain types of racket strings that were specialized for specific playing styles! Definitely a fun time.<br />
When we got back, it was time another lecture from Myung. This time we reviewed part of the 1st game from the Samsung Cup between Lee Sedol and Gu Li. The concept was a bit more abstract this time around. James and I discussed it while we played later on, so I feel like I have a better understanding of it. Granted, like the rest of the lectures from this convention, it will probably take some time before I get write a solid article on it.<br />
For the final pro event, I had to make a choice between attending another lecture by Myung or play a simul game with Stephanie Yin (1P).<br />

After a bit of thought, I decided that I didn&#8217;t want to pass up the opportunity to play another pro. So with that said, I sat down for my final simul game of the NAGC. Below is the game record.<br />

<div id='glift_display12' style='height:500px; width:100%; position:relative;'></div>
<script type='text/javascript'>gliftWidget = glift.create({"divId":"glift_display12","sgf":"http:\/\/bengozen.com\/\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/02\/2013.02.21-NAGC-Day-5-Game-3.sgf","display":{"theme":"DEFAULT","drawBoardCoords":"1"}});</script>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>When the game was over, Stephanie told me that she definitely thought I was stronger than 6 kyu. She recommended I further practice my life and death and reading, and I would progress very quickly. ^.^ It made me happy to hear that and I was very grateful for her compliment and advice.<br />
With all the events over, Myung, James and I tried to see if we could grab a bite to eat before the awards ceremony. Unfortunately there just didn&#8217;t seem to be enough time, but we decided that we would get food afterwards.<br />
The award ceremony room was decorated quite nicely with various flags and all the glass trophies up front. In addition, they managed to fill the entire lecture hall and more with people, which was rather impressive.<br />
There were all kinds of awards, but the most coveted ones went to a number of players from China who participated. I would be lying if I said I wasn&#8217;t the least bit envious and curious as to how I might have fared in the competition, but trust me when I say I do not regret my decision to not compete. Haha.<br />
For the final night of the NAGC, Myung, James and I went back to Bonchon for one last hurrah. Like a blur, all the food and good conversation was suddenly over. Before I knew it, I was dropping them off outside their hotel. With a firm handshake and an assurance that we&#8217;d be in touch, we parted ways for the final time.</p>
