				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hey everyone. Just wanted to let you know I&#8217;m still alive and well. Been getting into some really interesting projects these past few weeks and have been really pondering what I can do with blogging again since I miss doing it. And as someone who hates it when a regular blogger just drops out of the blogosphere, you can rest assured that I won&#8217;t ever just leave the blog hanging in the event I need to close up shop for awhile.<br />
In terms of what I&#8217;ve been up to, I&#8217;ve been tinkering again with daily regimens and playing games via <a title="Dragon Go Server" href="http://www.dragongoserver.net/">DGS</a> and <a title="Online Go Server" href="http://www.online-go.com/">OGS</a> while concurrently juggling a new job and trying to learn a ton of new skills. I&#8217;ve gone all the way back down to the very basics of doing only 10 life and death problems a day. They&#8217;re not hard in any sense of the word, but they help me to keep a connection to the world of go.<br />
And as a special treat for those who miss my reviews, I&#8217;ve decided to try reviewing one of my 9&#215;9 games that I played recently on GoQuest via an awesome new social kifu reviewing software called <a title="GoKibitz" href="http://www.gokibitz.com/">GoKibitz</a> that a close friend and long time rival built himself. So I hope you enjoy the review and I will try and post again soon!<br />
UPDATE: Apparently all my comments got lost in the abyss of the internet&#8230;. Oy vey&#8230; I&#8217;ll try and get another version up soon&#8230;.<br />

<p>After my third game in Yunguseng Dojang, I became a lot more comfortable playing White. Maybe it&#8217;s because I&#8217;ve started to really appreciate having komi. Either way, I&#8217;m glad to have broken away from my fear of playing White.<br />
This game was the first one I played after being dispelled of that anxiety of playing White. And believe it or not, it was actually a rather calm game where no dramatic battles of life and death occurred. See for yourself below!<br />

1,Opening,<strong>Move 30</strong> &#8211; Using the knight’s move to gain sente from the 3-3 invasion was a big reason why I could get an advantage this game., Surprisingly I cannot find any fault with my opening. Please let me know if you spot something I missed!<br />
2,Middle Game,&#8221;Overall it was quite peaceful and neither played created any big weak groups, but I managed to take more territory overall.&#8221;, N/A<br />
3,Fighting,&#8221;To my surprise, there wasn’t much fighting in this game.”, N/A<br />
4,Endgame,<strong>Move 164-175</strong> &#8211; I was proud to find this sequence that reduced a lot of Black’s points in sente., Hard to find any big flaws in my endgame. It seemed I was stronger than my opponent in this area.<br />
5,Overall Reading,<strong>Move 100</strong> &#8211; Finding this preparatory move for the resulting sequence was a big step forward for me.,Move 52 &#8211; I completely missed the double atari when I played here. Shame on me.<br />
6,Strategy,<strong>Move 78</strong> &#8211; Realizing that it would be difficult to continue severely attacking the Black group and simply cashing in on territory is a move I used to find it impossible to do.,&#8221;<strong>Move 52</strong> &#8211; Even if we assume this move works, there wasn’t much strategic value here since White did not have great potential in the center nor a weak group to attack.&#8221;<br />

<p>This opponent was a unique one since he thought longer than I did and took his time. He actually ended up in byoyomi early on in the game and used most of his byoyomi time which is really weird for Tygem since most players I&#8217;ve encountered play pretty quickly and I&#8217;m the one usually running out of time. Overall though, I felt that I was in control for most of the game. Hopefully you&#8217;ll agree! And if I&#8217;m totally wrong, please let me know!<br />

no,Category,Good,Bad<br />
1,Opening,<strong>Move 9-11</strong>: Ignoring White in the upper left was good in that I did not unnecessarily strengthen my opponent by trying to struggle.,&#8221;Other than the inconsistency of Move 21, I don’t see any egregious errors in regards to the opening.&#8221;<br />
2,Middle Game,<strong>Move 39-63</strong>: It felt like I did a good job attacking White while gaining nice 4th line territory on the right.,Can’t see any major mistakes at the moment.<br />
3,Fighting,Overall the fighting seemed to be in my favor most of the game. Nothing terribly complicated.,Didn’t see any real weaknesses in my fighting this game.<br />
4,Endgame,<strong>Move 219</strong>: Ignoring White’s atari at M1 to make an extra point showed I was not making automatic moves and trying to look for bigger plays.,<strong>Move 164</strong>: Letting what get the diagonal here first was rough.<br />
5,Overall Reading,<strong>Move 121</strong>: I was proud to be able to read out this attachment and know it could not be cut without some loss to White.,<strong>Move 70</strong>: I could sense there was double cut aji here but failed to read it out properly.<br />
6,Strategy,<strong>Move 81</strong>: Sacrificing the F3 group in exchange for breaking up the left side seemed to show good judgment.,&#8221;<strong>Move 21</strong>: Though successful, the 3-3 invasion seems to be contrary to my initial plan at making a moyo. So negative points for inconsistency.&#8221;<br />
