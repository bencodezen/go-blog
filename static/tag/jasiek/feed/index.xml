[expand title=&#8221;My Review&#8221; trigclass=&#8221;expandTitle&#8221; expanded=&#8221;true&#8221;]
Like many other players, when I first saw the title of this book, I wanted to get my hands on it as soon as I possibly could. However, while the idea of having all of the &#8220;fighting fundamentals&#8221; covered in a single book sounds enticing and attractive, there is way more than meets the eye.<br />
In order to understand my review on the book and how it relates to you, it is critical to first emphasize the following: fighting is a complicated topic. And when I say complicated, I mean it is probably by far the most complex and intricate of all the topics in go. Other things in go like joseki and fuseki can be explained rather simply with relative ease. Fighting, however, is a far more difficult animal to tackle. As a result, the thing I want you to realize from the get go is that fighting in go does not fit into easy principles like &#8220;approach from the wider side&#8221; the way you want it to.<br />
Secondly, I want to clearly state that my learning style is perhaps different than the average go player. If I were to use the analogy of a bird learning how to fly, I would have to say that there are a number of people out there who would learn flying methodically. In other words, they might learn to flap their wings first, and then maybe learn about air currents and how they impact flight patterns, etc. However, I am more of the jump out of the nest and learn to fly on the way down kind of person. I prefer experience and practical application over deep theories that require significant time of study.<br />
With that said, Jasiek has done a great job in producing the first English go book to really try and approach this monstrosity of a topic. As you can see from the table of contents, there are so many different aspects of fighting that Jasiek covers. And to be honest, I wouldn&#8217;t be surprised if there were a lot more that could be written on. However, as far as my personal experience goes, I have to say that working through the book felt a lot like the time I took organic chemistry in college.<br />
What do I mean by that? Well, at the very fundamental level, I accepted and understood the basic logic behind what was being taught. There were rules and general principles that applied to why things worked the way they did. Before I knew it though, I was drowning in a sea of different theories, terms and intricacies that overwhelmed my brain and it didn&#8217;t take long before I started losing interest. &#8220;If you attack here, you must keep in mind of X; but also realize that Y might impact Z in a way that implicates the life of X and Y.&#8221; *dizzy*<br />
The thing to realize is this: fighting is complicated. And while Jasiek has done a great job trying to organize it into different sections and try to break everything down into principles, it doesn&#8217;t change the fact that fighting is a multi-faceted skill that will not improve simply because you read a book. There are so many aspects that go into it: your reading ability, your positional judgment ability, your life and death, etc. So unless those are up to par, fighting will still seem like a chaotic whirlwind that you won&#8217;t be able to make much sense of.<br />
At the end of the day, while I personally had a difficult time absorbing the material in the book, this book is truly a milestone for Western go literature in its effort to pioneer a way for us to learn about fighting. And to be honest, I think that I might just be a weird outlier who doesn&#8217;t have the diligence or tenacity to absorb the material. So if even a small part of you believes that you have the personality and learning style suited to benefiting from this book, then I would disregard my experience of the book and recommend you get it whenever possible.<br />

[expand title=&#8221;Synopsis&#8221; trigclass=&#8221;expandTitle&#8221;]
<strong>What did I enjoy about the book?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>There are lots of examples throughout the book.</li>
<li>Utilizes typographic elements like bullet points and bold to emphasize its points.</li>
<li>A very thorough breakdown of topics that fit together well logistically.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What did I gain from reading this book?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Realization that I am a far cry from being able to truly grasp and apply the material in the book.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What is the format of the book?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Textbook. Concepts are introduced and are accompanied by numerous examples along with a few practice problems at the end of each section as well.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What aspects can be improved on?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>I am only commenting on this from a weak amateur perspective, but the information was very difficult to process as a whole for myself. And to be fair, I recognize that this book is an important step to creating a more &#8220;user-friendly&#8221; version of teaching fighting principles, but overall I had a harder time working through and learning with this book due to my learning style.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Is this book easy to read?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>There is so much information in this book that it is not easy to gloss through at all. It definitely reads more like an academic textbook that requires slow and deliberate reading. Almost as if you were taking a course and you were trying to memorize all the different theories and how they fit together.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Bottom Line</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>A great first milestone for Western literature on the topic of fighting.</li>
<li>Suited for players who are very studious and enjoy learning through an intricate textbook.</li>
<li>Not recommended for players looking to get a light overview of fighting.</li>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Positional Judgement 1: Territory</h2>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> Ever wonder how players manage to estimate territory? And with terrifying accuracy? Well look no farther, with the first volume of Jasiek&#8217;s Positional Judgment, you can get an inside look at the inner workings of how players make these accurate estimations. It&#8217;s filled with numerous examples for you to practice, but be wary, this is definitely not for the light hearted! On the other hand, rest assured that you will be significantly stronger at positional judgment than most players out there if you can master the material in here.<br />

[expand title=&#8221;Before I Read This Book&#8230;&#8221; trigclass=&#8221;expandTitle&#8221;]
I&#8217;ve been told countless times that I need to be better of positional Judgment. Before this book, the only other book on this topic (in English) was Positional Judgment by Cho Chikun. So when I got the opportunity to review the book, I jumped at the opportunity since I still don&#8217;t feel terribly confident about my abilities to make position judgments.<br />
[/expand]
[expand title=&#8221;My Review&#8221; trigclass=&#8221;expandTitle&#8221; expanded=&#8221;true&#8221;]
When I first started reading this book, the first thing I noticed is that the layout of the book is very clean. Examples of this include shorter paragraphs, proper spacing between paragraphs, proper usage of bullet points and numbered lists, using bold appropriately, etc. And though this might seem like completely irrelevant, but I personally believe that poor book layouts make it difficult for the reader to read and learn the material properly. And since go literature is still maturing, it was great to see Jasiek&#8217;s books taking a step forward in the right direction.<br />
The second thing that I couldn&#8217;t help but notice is the countless examples that Jasiek uses in this book. This is a welcome change to books that consist of lots of texts and explanation for a few diagrams because weaker amateur players like myself benefit more from increased exposure as opposed to one extremely detailed and high level analysis. And though I would have liked to have seen more examples that utilized smaller boards to acclimate the reader to the material, the examples are great and will provide plenty of material for the studious reader.<br />
Now of course, there is the question of how the content is. I have two words for it: extremely thorough. I&#8217;m talking textbook thorough. I mean if you just look at the table of contents above, you&#8217;ll notice how Jasiek breaks up positional judgment into different categories. In addition, there are even mathematical arguments for things like why basic endgame kos are worth 1/3 point. This is great because you can always be sure that Jasiek will back up his statements with evidence and proof. And though this might be a little overwhelming for players like me who are nervous about positional judgment, this gives the reader the opportunity to come back later and gain a more in-depth understanding of calculating territory if desired.<br />
In addition, I would have to say that Jasiek does a good job mixing in some theory and new terms on the topic of positional judgment. For example, one of the innovative concepts that I found rather simple and profound is that positional judgment relies on peaceful reductions from the outside as opposed to complicated fighting variations. And in terms of new terminology, Jasiek introduces the term &#8220;quiescence&#8221; to try and further explain concepts within positional judgment.<br />
As a general overview of the book, I would have to say it is incredibly comprehensive and thorough on the topic of positional judgment. It is incredibly in-depth and detailed in regards to its explanations of specific topics and can be rather advanced if the reader is looking for a broad overview of positional judgment. So while any person who reads and fully masters the content in this book would become VERY good at positional judgment, it can be a bit scary for players looking to casually learn about the topic.<br />
[/expand]
[expand title=&#8221;Synopsis&#8221; trigclass=&#8221;expandTitle&#8221;]
<strong>What did I enjoy about the book?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Effectively utilizes page layout and text elements to deliver his message.</li>
<li>It is extremely detailed and uses a methodical and precise approach to show how Jasiek calculates territory.</li>
<li>There are so many examples! Examples galore!</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What did I gain from reading this book?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Introduction to new terms and ideas regarding positional judgment.</li>
<li>Better understanding of how strong players arrive at their positional judgments.</li>
<li>More confidence in my ability to count, while knowing I have a long way to go.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What is the format of the book?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Textbook. Concepts are introduced and are accompanied by numerous examples along with a few practice problems at the end of each section as well.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What aspects can be improved on?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>There were momentary lapses when I thought the grammatical structure/syntax was a little off, but this might be due to the fact that I come from &#8220;American English.&#8221;</li>
<li>Perhaps this is a chronic issue I have, but I would have liked to have seen more introductory level problems to acclimate players who are not accustomed to judging 19&#215;19 board positions.</li>
<li>This may be personal taste, but I would have preferred to see the game information for all the diagrams be placed in a Reference section instead since it makes the problem a bit cluttered and hard to find the pertinent information to the reader (i.e., Black to play).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Is this book easy to read?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>This book contains a wealth of information and is probably appropriately seen as a textbook. As a result, don&#8217;t expect it to flow like a conversation or a casual lecture from Kageyama and such. It takes time to read and digest. In fact, I will need to go through this book multiple times before I can say I feel I know the material well.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Bottom Line</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>An incredible step forward for the English go literature community on positional judgment.</li>
<li>The most methodical and detailed book on positional judgment that I&#8217;ve read thus far.</li>
<li>Totally worth every penny if you&#8217;re interested in gaining an in-depth understanding of how positional judgment works.</li>
</ol>
