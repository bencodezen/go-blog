				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Up till now, my go studies have been pretty sporadic. I may have read my fair share of books and watched my fair share of videos, but I would have to say that I really never spent the time and energy really absorbing them. Sure, I was exposed to lots of new concepts and ideas; but implementing them in my games was a whole different animal.<br />
After reading a <a title="What Was Nonsense Becomes Possible - Noseki" href="http://noseki.com/2014/05/08/what-was-nonsense-becomes-possible/">post</a> from fellow go blogger Noseki, I was inspired to take a new approach with my go studies by fully immersing myself in it. For example, in my game for <a title="Yunguseng Dojang" href="http://www.yunguseng.com/">Yunguseng Dojang</a>, I replayed every move on the real board and really took my time to absorb each and every move (which is the reason I ended up losing on time since I completely did not pay attention to my computer which was telling me I was running out of time).<br />
In addition, I&#8217;ve also revamped my primary study materials for books. I&#8217;m going back to the Level Up Series (starting with <a title="Book Review: Level Up Review 1" href="//book-review-level-up-review-1/">Level Up! Review 1</a> since I don&#8217;t have time to start all the way back at <a title="Book Review: Level UpÂ 1" href="//book-review-level-up-1/">Level Up 1</a>) and working my way through it with extreme thoroughness. In other words, no solution whatsoever. I will work through every problem and solve it with absolute certainty before moving on.<br />
If I have any hope of becoming any stronger, I think that it&#8217;s finally time that I stopped cutting corners. The time for me to be knocking at the door of the dans is fast approaching, and I have no intention of letting myself be caught unawares when that time comes.</p>
