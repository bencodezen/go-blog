<strong>What&#8217;s the best aspect about this product?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Light-weight and super affordable!</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What is the weakest aspect of this product?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Upon close inspection, the lines are not as clean as you&#8217;ll see on more expensive boards; but it still does the job well!</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Is it durable?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>After handling it, I see no reason why it won&#8217;t hold up to normal usage. However, if somewhere were to try and karate chop this board, I&#8217;m pretty sure it&#8217;d break. xD</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Bottom Line</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>A great go board for someone on a budget!</li>
<li>And in the event you know how to play Chinese chess, there&#8217;s a board of that on the back as well!</li>
<li>Definitely recommended over paper and/or plastic boards that exist out there!</li>
</ol>
[/expand]
[expand title=&#8221;My Review&#8221; trigclass=&#8221;expandTitle&#8221; expanded=&#8221;true&#8221;]
Here&#8217;s the front of the board at a slanted angle. It&#8217;s a nice yellow color to give it a semi-shin-kaya feel. (I prefer the yellow color over brown since it shows more contrast when stones are placed on the board; but that&#8217;s just a personal preference.)</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/01/dirtcheapgoboard02.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-4544" alt="dirtcheapgoboard02" src="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/01/dirtcheapgoboard02.jpg?resize=360%2C270" width="360" height="270" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">And here below, you can see that there&#8217;s a Chinese chess board on the back!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/01/dirtcheapgoboard03.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-4545" alt="dirtcheapgoboard03" src="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/01/dirtcheapgoboard03.jpg?resize=360%2C270" width="360" height="270" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Upon closer inspection, you&#8217;ll see that the lines are not perfectly straight the way you&#8217;ll see on higher quality boards. However, I wouldn&#8217;t let this be a deterrent from purchasing the board if it&#8217;s being used for casual play.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/01/dirtcheapgoboard04.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-4546" alt="dirtcheapgoboard04" src="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/01/dirtcheapgoboard04.jpg?resize=360%2C270" width="360" height="270" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Here are a couple of shots with the board in action with my size 36 glass stones. As you can see, the lines are not so obvious from a player&#8217;s perspective.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/01/dirtcheapgoboard05.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-4547" alt="dirtcheapgoboard05" src="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/01/dirtcheapgoboard05.jpg?resize=360%2C270" width="360" height="270" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/01/dirtcheapgoboard06.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-4548" alt="dirtcheapgoboard06" src="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/01/dirtcheapgoboard06.jpg?resize=360%2C270" width="360" height="270" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/01/dirtcheapgoboard07.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-4549" alt="dirtcheapgoboard07" src="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/01/dirtcheapgoboard07.jpg?resize=360%2C270" width="360" height="270" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Bottom line: I highly recommend this board for people who are looking to purchase boards for their club or for tournaments. This board would also function well as a casual study/playing board. However, I would definitely not recommend this as a primary goban for anyone who is looking for that classic air and sound you get from true wooden boards. So remember, the key thing to remember is that this is a board that focuses on affordability and practicality.</p>

<p><strong>Description:</strong> &#8220;Weighing in at just 20.5 oz (580 g), the Featherweight Go Set is even lighter than your average travel Go set. But here&#8217;s the thing; it&#8217;s a proper, full sized Go board with stones. It includes size 21 plastic stones (0.3 inches or 8 mm thick) with a 0.8 inch (20 mm) diameter and a durable, full size, crease resistant 19&#215;19 plastic Go board. The board can easily be folded or rolled, making this set highly portable. Keep a set in your bag or briefcase so that you&#8217;re always ready for a serendipitous game of Go!&#8221; &#8211; GoGameGuru<br />

<strong>What&#8217;s the best aspect about this product?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Portability! It&#8217;s one of the lightest products I&#8217;ve encountered while still maintaining decent quality!</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What is the weakest aspect of this product?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>As someone who is used to using real stones, the stones can feel a bit lighter than desired; but to be honest, it beats not having any board or stones to play when you&#8217;re out and about!</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Is it durable?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The stones are plastic and should hold up well enough. The board is made of fabric so it shouldn&#8217;t tear so easily, but will probably wear out over time with use and will eventually need replacing.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Bottom Line</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Great lightweight go set for that one can easily pack without noticing any additional weight or bulkiness.</li>
<li>Recommended for any player looking to always have a go set on hand without the hassle or concern over the safety of a wooden board or real stones.</li>
</ol>

[expand title=&#8221;My Review&#8221; trigclass=&#8221;expandTitle&#8221; expanded=&#8221;true&#8221;]
True to their word, this featherweight go set came packed in a super light way with no bulky boxes!<br />
<figure id="attachment_4492" style="width: 360px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/01/featherweightgoset02.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-4492" alt="featherweightgoset02" src="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/01/featherweightgoset02.jpg?resize=360%2C270" width="360" height="270" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">As you can see, everything fits in one bag!</figcaption></figure>
<figure id="attachment_4493" style="width: 360px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/01/featherweightgoset03.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-4493" alt="featherweightgoset03" src="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/01/featherweightgoset03.jpg?resize=360%2C270" width="360" height="270" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Contents of the bag: two bags of stones and one board</figcaption></figure>
<figure id="attachment_4494" style="width: 360px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/01/featherweightgoset04.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-4494" alt="featherweightgoset04" src="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/01/featherweightgoset04.jpg?resize=360%2C270" width="360" height="270" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">The board unfolded</figcaption></figure>
The board is made of fabric and has a nice feel to it. It does have a little issue staying flat after being packaged and folded for so long, but a little patience and flattening helped to keep it pretty straight. And like the description says, it really does feel like a full size board when you spread it out over the table.<br />
<figure id="attachment_4495" style="width: 360px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/01/featherweightgoset05.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-4495" alt="featherweightgoset05" src="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/01/featherweightgoset05.jpg?resize=360%2C270" width="360" height="270" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Close-up of the stones</figcaption></figure>
As you can see for the stones, they are not simply plastic biconvex stones; but they also have a flat center on both sides in order to ease with the stone placement on the board. Though this is contrary to typical stone design, I think that this works out great for this set since the plastic stones are not very heavy to begin with. So as a result, the flat center really helps out.<br />
<figure id="attachment_4496" style="width: 360px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/01/featherweightgoset06.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-4496" alt="featherweightgoset06" src="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/01/featherweightgoset06.jpg?resize=360%2C270" width="360" height="270" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Entire set in action</figcaption></figure>
<figure id="attachment_4497" style="width: 360px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/01/featherweightgoset07.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-4497" alt="featherweightgoset07" src="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/01/featherweightgoset07.jpg?resize=360%2C270" width="360" height="270" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Close-up of the set in action</figcaption></figure>
As you can see, it&#8217;s a great set that really provides a wonderful experience when it&#8217;s impossible to carry around a wooden board and real stones. As someone who has used cheaper &#8220;featherweight&#8221; sets that were plastic boards and such, this is a huge improvement and is the one I recommend if you&#8217;re looking for your &#8220;featherweight go set.&#8221; Hope this helped!<br />

<li>Because it&#8217;s made out of leather, it doesn&#8217;t have the wood sound when you place each stone, but this is expected and it should be noted that it comes with its own pleasant feeling when each stone contacts the board.</li>

<li>As far as I can tell, this will be able to go through a serious beating before becoming unusable.</li>

[expand title=&#8221;What I Was Hoping For&#8221; trigclass=&#8221;expandTitle&#8221;]
When <a href="https://twitter.com/AmbyR00">AmbyR00</a> first told me about his board, I was hoping that it would be something that would be easily stored away and difficult to store away. In addition, I was hoping that it would be made of quality leather so that it didn&#8217;t feel cheap and easily frayed and damaged.<br />
[/expand]
[expand title=&#8221;My Review&#8221; trigclass=&#8221;expandTitle&#8221; expanded=&#8221;true&#8221;]
A majority of the gobans that I have owned thus far have all been made of wood, so I was thrilled to get a chance to review a goban made of non-traditional material!<br />
<figure id="attachment_4441" style="width: 360px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/01/leathergoban01.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-4441" alt="leathergoban01" src="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/01/leathergoban01.jpg?resize=360%2C270" width="360" height="270" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Here is it in all its glory! (The back is just a straight leather pattern with no markings, so I didn&#8217;t take a picture of it.)</figcaption></figure>
<p style="text-align: left;">Though impacted by a slight tinge of yellow lighting, the board is a beautiful coffee brown color that contrasts really well with the black lines drawn for the goban.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">As it stands, I think that this makes a great table goban since it&#8217;s super light-weight and is really a pleasure to use. Here are some pictures of the board in action!</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">At the end of the day, if you&#8217;re looking for a light-weight goban that looks gorgeous and is easy to store away, this leather goban definitely fits the bill! Let me know if you ever have any additional questions!</p>

[expand title=&#8221;How Was It Made?&#8221; trigclass=&#8221;expandTitle&#8221; expanded=&#8221;true&#8221;]
<em>The original post can be found here: &#8220;<a title="AmbyR00's Blog Post on Creating His Leather Goban" href="http://worldismygoban.blogspot.fi/2010/12/leather-is-sexy-especially-with-polka.html">Leather is sexy, especially with polka dots</a>&#8220;, but I&#8217;ve recreated the content here because my biggest fear is that the link might break one day if Blogger ever goes down.</em><br />
&#8220;As I&#8217;m working as an intern in a little workshop that prints and binds calendars and presses many different things from many different materials I got an opportunity to use a silk press to print some leather gobans for the go club I plan to set up. Now all I need is some stones.<br />
I used Inkscape to create <a href="http://ubuntuone.com/p/SUZ/">the print</a> (hint: use Inkscape to view it!) on the leather board, you can download the design and freely use it with your own goban. I printed the board on six transparencies, that I taped together and used as a film to develop a template for the silk press. I was originally going for six goban, but ended up with ten of them.<br />
<figure id="attachment_4616" style="width: 400px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/01/leathergobanpost01.jpeg"><img class="size-full wp-image-4616" alt="leathergobanpost01" src="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/01/leathergobanpost01.jpeg?resize=400%2C300" width="400" height="300" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">The leather before it was cut. This wasn&#8217;t the only one.</figcaption></figure>
<figure id="attachment_4617" style="width: 480px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/01/leathergobanpost02.jpeg"><img class="size-full wp-image-4617" alt="leathergobanpost02" src="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/01/leathergobanpost02.jpeg?resize=480%2C640" width="480" height="640" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">This was the template used to create the prints on the boards.</figcaption></figure>
The finished boards look actually very nice. Leather is pretty good material for creating something like a portable goban. I&#8217;ll need to take a picture of one in daylight so it captures the whole beauty of them. Here&#8217;s one I took with my phone when they were out from print and drying up:<br />
<figure id="attachment_4618" style="width: 472px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/01/leathergobanpost03.jpeg"><img class=" wp-image-4618" alt="leathergobanpost03" src="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/01/leathergobanpost03.jpeg?resize=472%2C354" width="472" height="354" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">The finished boards. The polka dots really cheer them up.</figcaption></figure>
Actually, these are not the first boards I have made, I also did some smaller practice boards few months ago from plywood, <a href="http://www.dammfine.com/projects/gobans/">laser printed paper gobans</a>, glue and water.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/01/leathergobanpost04.jpeg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-4619" alt="leathergobanpost04" src="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/01/leathergobanpost04.jpeg?resize=464%2C348" width="464" height="348" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Folding Go Board</h2>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> When it comes to go on the go (yes that just happened), this folding go board from GoGameGuru really does seem to hit the sweet spot between portability, quality, and price. It utilizes a hinge mechanism to keep the go board in one piece and even has a Chinese chess board on the reverse side! Recommended stone size are 21 or 22. It fits other stones, but it&#8217;s a bit snug. Highly recommended!<br />

[expand title=&#8221;Synopsis&#8221; trigclass=&#8221;expandTitle&#8221;]
<strong>What&#8217;s the best aspect about this product?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A legitimate portable wooden board that looks great when using it!</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What is one aspect this product could improve on?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>This is expected and in the product description, but I can&#8217;t help but wish that the board could accommodate all sizes of stones. Granted, that would make the board larger; but it&#8217;s just a small thing that would be nice. =D</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Is it durable?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>So far so good! The laminate does seem like it could dent if you dropped something heavy on it, but it seems to hold up just fine with regular use (aka placing stones on the board). The wood also seems quite solid, but I would refrain from dropping it.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Bottom Line</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>An incredible portable board that looks great when you&#8217;re using it.</li>
<li>Fits like a dream in my backpack and delivers on portability.</li>
<li>The best portable board I&#8217;ve seen on the market so far. Highly recommended!</li>

[expand title=&#8221;What I Was Hoping For&#8221; trigclass=&#8221;expandTitle&#8221;]
For those who have been following me since the beginning, I&#8217;m sure you remembered that I bought <a title="Equipment Review: Folding Wooden Go Board" href="//equipment-review-folding-wooden-go-board/">one</a> quite some time ago. During my hiatus of go, it transferred ownership to my good friend Nate. So naturally, with me being back in go full force, it was inevitable that I would need to find a replacement. And though I have seen one or two online, the shipping has always been rather ridiculous or the board wasn&#8217;t quite what I was looking for. So when I found out about this product, I couldn&#8217;t order it fast enough!<br />
[/expand]
[expand title=&#8221;My Review&#8221; trigclass=&#8221;expandTitle&#8221; expanded=&#8221;true&#8221;]
<figure id="attachment_4330" style="width: 320px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2013/11/foldinggoban02.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-4330" alt="foldinggoban02" src="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2013/11/foldinggoban02.jpg?resize=320%2C240" width="320" height="240" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Folding go board in its box (front side)</figcaption></figure>
<figure id="attachment_4331" style="width: 320px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2013/11/foldinggoban03.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-4331" alt="foldinggoban03" src="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2013/11/foldinggoban03.jpg?resize=320%2C240" width="320" height="240" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Folding go board in its box (rear side)</figcaption></figure>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2013/11/foldinggoban04.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-4332" alt="foldinggoban04" src="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2013/11/foldinggoban04.jpg?resize=320%2C240" width="320" height="240" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">As you can see in the pictures above, the board comes in a well designed box that looked quite professional. If they could translate the text into English, I could totally see this product being primed for being sold in Western stores (since some people just get weirded out by languages they don&#8217;t understand). Some of the go products I&#8217;ve seen sold in book stores and such seem a bit shoddy and could really use a make-over.</p>
<figure id="attachment_4333" style="width: 320px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2013/11/foldinggoban05.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-4333" alt="foldinggoban05" src="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2013/11/foldinggoban05.jpg?resize=320%2C240" width="320" height="240" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">The folding go board in all its glory&#8230;</figcaption></figure>

This was a pleasant surprise for me when I unfolded it. I used to play Chinese chess when I was a kid and so I was pretty psyched when I found out that this portable board could also double as a Chinese chess board. Score! But for the those who have no interest in this side, you can take comfort in that the hinges are exposed on this side so that it does not interfere with the go side of the board.<br />
<figure id="attachment_4338" style="width: 320px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2013/11/foldinggoban10.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-4338" alt="foldinggoban10" src="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2013/11/foldinggoban10.jpg?resize=320%2C240" width="320" height="240" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Folding go board in action with size 36 glass stones!</figcaption></figure>

<figure id="attachment_4340" style="width: 320px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2013/11/foldinggoban12.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-4340" alt="foldinggoban12" src="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2013/11/foldinggoban12.jpg?resize=320%2C240" width="320" height="240" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Folding go board in action with size 36 glass stones (close-up #2)</figcaption></figure>
As you can see from the photos of the board in action, the size 36 stones fit rather snugly on the board and can feel a bit cluttered. So though it does fit, it would make for a more enjoyable experience to use size 21/22 stones as recommended. As a result, it&#8217;s no surprise that I will would recommend the <a title="Equipment Review: The Go Bento Box" href="//equipment-review-go-bento-box/">Go Bento Box</a> as this board&#8217;s traveling companion.<br />
At the end of the day, this board really does a remarkable job of providing portability, great value, and a very pleasing aesthetic look for an incredible price. Definitely well worth every penny. So if you&#8217;re in the market for a folding go board, be sure to add this one to your cart!</p>

</ul>
<p><span id="more-93"></span></p>
<h3>Detailed Review</h3>
<p><strong>Size &amp; Weight:</strong> The entire set is as light as a feather and easily fits in practically any bag (except possibly purses).  To further clarify, unless you have cargo pants that have massive pockets, this is not a set you can carry around with you in your pocket. And in all honesty, who wants to play on a board that is pocket size. Can you imagine how small the stones would be?!<br />
<strong>Dura­bil­ity:</strong> The entire set is made of plastic that should survive any normal wear and tear. Now granted, if a child decides to throw a tantrum and stomp all over it, I am pretty sure that your board will be demolished. In terms of the stones, you are far more likely to lose the stones before they ever break or crack. In addition, the magnetic board is adhered pretty well to the plastic; but any decent use of force will allow you to pull it off, so be careful.<br />
<strong>Usabil­ity:</strong> The overall design of the set is done well and quite pleasant to use. Due to the cost of the board however, it is to be expected that the stones are sometimes a little oddly shaped or cut slightly off. This doesn&#8217;t detract from the general usage, but can be a little aesthetically irritating to some people.<br />
Even though the set might come with a couple ill-shaped pieces with missing magnets, the value and quality of the board outmatches the price that you pay for it. Sure, there are many ways to improve the quality of the board; but I wouldn&#8217;t hold my breath for a portable go set with the quality and value of a true wood / stone go set. The purpose of this set is for recreational play during travel as opposed to serious play during tournament, so be sure to have the right expectations when you order this set.</p>

<li>Great portable board considering I got it for around $10.</li>
<li>The lines are not drawn the best, but it does the job and is worth the purchase.</li>
<li>Let me know if you find this anywhere online, since the local store doesn&#8217;t sell it anymore.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Prod­uct Details</h3>
<ul>
<li>One folding Go Board (19&#215;19).</li>
<li>Measures 18-1/4&#8243;L x 17&#8243;W x 3-3/4&#8243;H (46.5cm x 43cm x 9.7cm).</li>
<li>Board is 1-1/2&#8243; (4cm) thick.</li>
</ul>
<p><span id="more-76"></span></p>
<h3>Detailed Review</h3>
<p><strong>Size &amp; Weight:</strong> For it&#8217;s portability, the size actually is quite nice since it fits in my 14 inch laptop messenger bag. It&#8217;s light compared to any other table board you might buy.<br />
<strong>Dura­bil­ity:</strong> It holds up very well and very reliable in transit. I&#8217;ve carried it a number of times and never worried about dings or scratches that might ruin the board.<br />
<strong>Usabil­ity:</strong> The sound that the board makes from stones hitting it are not nearly as fulfilling as one might get from a shin-kaya board, but it really fits the bill when you&#8217;re looking for an easy to transport go board.<br />
Although the local store does not sell it anymore, this product is definitely worth buying if you ever see one. In fact, the moment anyone finds a place that sells it, be sure to let me know!</p>

<h3>High­lights</h3>
<ul>
<li>If by rosewood they mean a cheap knock-off layer of &#8220;wanna-be&#8221; rosewood and then layered by cheap wood, then they accomplished their job.</li>
<li>Although the lines look semi-elegant in the product image, it ended up looking rather cheap and hard to see on the board.</li>
<li>DO NOT PURCHASE THIS BOARD!</li>
</ul>
<h3>Prod­uct Details (What They Claim)</h3>
<ul>
<li>One 48cm x 52cm x 3cm reversible board (19&#215;19 Go and Chinese Chess).</li>
<li>&#8220;Exquisite and unique Chinese chess board made of solid rosewood inlaid with wooden lines.&#8221;</li>
<li>Weight: 5kg.</li>
</ul>
<p><span id="more-18"></span></p>
<h3>Detailed Review</h3>
<p><strong>Size &amp; Weight:</strong> The board is standard size and nothing out of the ordinary. The weight however, is rather heavy and not great for portability.<br />
<strong>Dura­bil­ity: </strong>The board was damaged during transit. Now normally I would not blame the board, but when I saw the damage and how the top layer was peeling off and the construction was so poor; I just can&#8217;t imagine that this board is that reliable.<br />
<strong>Usabil­ity:</strong> You can play go stones on top of it, but otherwise, I would have hated using this board since the wood grain was irregular, ugly, and the lines on top were hard to see.<br />
If I were to hypothesize how they built this board, I imagine them taking a random slab of wood, put either cheap laminate material that looks like rosewood around the board, and then painted it with a Chinese Chess board on one side and a Go board on the other. The grain was not unified, and the design quality of the board (e.g. the paint that draws out the lines of the Go board and the stars) was terrible. In fact, I was so unhappy with the board that I couldn&#8217;t even bring myself to take pictures of its miserable quality and just wanted to get my money back as soon as possible.<br />
Bottom line:<strong> Do not buy this board</strong>. There is no link to purchase it, and I&#8217;m not even including the vendor I purchased it from for the sake of keeping one more person from making my mistake of purchasing it. And if you see other &#8220;rosewood&#8221; products with a similar claim to this one (e.g., reversible Chinese chess / go board), the products are most likely identical and I would stay far far away.</p>

<h3>Detailed Review</h3>
<p><strong>Size &amp; Weight:</strong> Absolutely perfect. It&#8217;s small enough that it could fit in a backpack if you needed to. So unlike a real board and stones, it&#8217;s very easy to store away and doesn&#8217;t take up very much space. And in regards to the weight, it has enough weight to feel solid; but otherwise it&#8217;s super light and easy to carry.<br />
<strong>Dura­bil­ity:</strong> I&#8217;ve had this product for more than a year now and words cannot express how appreciate I am to have a product that holds up so well. The case is still great condition, and the stone bags have a little wear and tear but nothing major. In addition, the stones and board show some signs of use; but they are still working magnificently.<br />
<strong>Usabil­ity:</strong> Absolutely no complaints. The board flattens out with relative ease, and the stones* cling to the board rather well. (In one of the shots below, you&#8217;ll see that I have the board upside down and nothing falls off). In addition, putting everything back in the case is actually really easy. Since the bags that are carrying the stones are made with fabric, they conform to the shape of the case with a relative ease when you shake it a bit. And if you&#8217;re wondering about how the strap works in terms of slinging it over your back, it works fantastic.<br />
Considering how much this costs, this is honestly one of the best value items that exists on the entire go market. I could go on about how awesome this product is, but bottom line: unless you want a portable set made of actual stones and wood, this is hands down the best portable go set out there.<br />
<em>*Some people say that the stones are &#8220;too small,&#8221; but let&#8217;s be fair people, this is a portable set. If you want full sized stones, go and lug your stones and bowls. </em></p>

<h3>Highlights</h3>

<h3>Detailed Review</h3>
<p>This was my first set of real go equipment. When it arrived, I was happier than a child on a shopping spree at a toy store. And so, you can imagine how happy I was to see that my order was packaged very well. Here are some shots of the package:<br />
<a href="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2013/03/gosetbox.jpg"><img class="aligncenter" alt="gosetbox" src="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2013/03/gosetbox.jpg?resize=300%2C225" width="300" height="225" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><br />
<figure id="attachment_2402" style="width: 300px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2013/03/gosetbox2.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2402" alt="gosetbox2" src="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2013/03/gosetbox2.jpg?resize=300%2C225" width="300" height="225" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">As you can see, the contents inside are very well protected.</figcaption></figure>
Everything arrived in great condition. The only issue I had was that some of the black stones were missing from the set. So I contacted <a href="http://www.ymimports.com/">YMImports</a> that very day, and received a response within 12 hours notifying me that they would send replacement stones. Way to live up to your reputation of great customer service <a href="https://www.ymimports.com/">YMImports</a>!<br />

<li><a title="Equipment Review: Go Stones and Bowls Carrying Bag" href="//equipment-review-go-stones-and-bowls-carrying-bag/">Go Stones and Bowls Carrying Bag</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The set as a whole is an incredible value. Unless you are looking to specifically buy a floor board, portable board, or another kind of stone (e.g., slate and shell), this the best deal that you&#8217;re going to find.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Shin-Kaya &#8211; 1-1/2&#8243; (4 cm) Go Floor / Table Board</h2>
<h2 style="text-align: center;"> Overall Rating: 10 / 10 Ponnuki</h2>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">Highlights</h3>
<ul>
<li><span style="line-height: 13px;">Legs are removable, which allows the board to function as both a floor and table board.</span></li>
<li>The floor height is not nearly as high as the standard floor board, but it is pretty good for the price and quality of the board.</li>
<li>This is a good board that is more suited for staying at the house and not quite suitable for bringing to a coffee shop to review a pro game.</li>
<li>Stones that measure 9.2mm (Size 33) fit comfortably on the board. Any size larger maybe a bit of a squeeze.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Product Details</h3>

<h3 style="text-align: left;">Detailed Review</h3>
<p>As this was my first legitimate go board (aka goban), I was incredibly excited the day it arrived on my doorstep. To add to my excitement, I was delighted to find out that everything was packaged extremely well. To prove my point, look at the how well protected the board is!<br />
<figure id="attachment_2314" style="width: 300px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2010/09/4skb1.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2314" alt="4skb1" src="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2010/09/4skb1.jpg?resize=300%2C225" width="300" height="225" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Top layer of styrofoam (not in picture)</figcaption></figure>
Here are the contents of the order in its entirety.<br />
<figure id="attachment_2319" style="width: 300px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2010/09/4skb2.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2319" alt="Board + Information Pamphlet + Introduction to Go Brochure" src="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2010/09/4skb2.jpg?resize=300%2C225" width="300" height="225" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Board + Info Pamphlet + Intro to Go Brochure</figcaption></figure>
<strong>Size &amp; Weight:</strong> The board has a nice weight to it that feels extremely solid. In terms of portability however, it&#8217;s not something that I would recommend trying to carry around. In other words, this is a board that is perfect as an &#8220;at home&#8221; type of goban.<br />
<strong>Durability:</strong> I have had it now for more than two years and found that the board holds up very well. Like any other wood product however, be very careful in regards to dropping objects on it since it will scratch and leave dents. Otherwise, I have played many stones on it and have not seen any blemishes or fading as a result.<br />
<strong>Functionality:</strong> Now the best part about this board is that the legs are removable, so it doubles as a great solid table board while also giving you the option of using it as a floor board. For those who cry blasphemy at the idea of calling it a floor board, I know that it&#8217;s full height of 6 cm does not compare to the typical height of 15-21 cm; but considering the price tag of $60 versus the average $400+ floor board, I think it does a great job.<br />
Before I conclude, I want to address the two types of buyers that I would not recommend this board for:</p>
<ol>
<li><span style="line-height: 13px;"><strong>&#8220;I want a floor board like the one in Hikaru has.&#8221;</strong> &#8211; This is absolutely not the product for you. I have not purchased one yet, but they are rather expensive ($400 minimum for a decent quality one from my research) and not as readily available. If I ever buy one, I will be sure to update this section with my review.</span></li>
<li><strong>&#8220;I need a board that is easy to store away / portable.&#8221;</strong> &#8211; This board is a little too big and thick to be stuffing away in a corner or bookshelf somewhere inconspicuously. Instead, I would recommend looking for a foldable board or a thinner one if at all possible. (<em>Reviews for these types of products will be added in the near future</em>).</li>
</ol>
<p>Otherwise, if you&#8217;re in the market for a quality go board for a great price that can double as a floor and table board, this is the one for you.</p>
