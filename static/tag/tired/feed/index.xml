				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Recently, I have been trying to figure out how to resolve my problem of being undisciplined when it comes to reading out sequences or figuring out what move to play next.<br />
One of the first solutions I came up with was to simply try and practice more problems, but it didn&#8217;t really seem to help much. So the next thing I tried was reading more theoretical go books in hopes of having something click inside me that would all of a sudden fix my problem. That didn&#8217;t work out too well either.<br />
After some thought, I realized that my problem is actually multidimensional.</p>
<ol>
<li><span style="line-height: 13px;"><strong>Physical Energy</strong> &#8211; I have been a lot more tired than I would like to admit lately. Though I didn&#8217;t recognize it at the time, it was playing a major role in my being nonchalant about what or where I played next.  </span></li>
<li><strong>Multiple Points of Focus</strong> &#8211; Those who know me personally will attest to the fact that I am the type who is constantly trying to multi-task and can jump from one thing to another in a blink of an eye. While that can be useful in certain contexts, it is actually becoming detrimental to my go in the long run (along with other things, but let&#8217;s face it, go is the first priority here. =P).</li>
<li><strong>Overload / Burnout</strong> &#8211; As a result of the previous two points, it is only natural that my brain would eventually become overloaded and simply burnout.</li>
</ol>
<p>It&#8217;s clear that I need a reboot on my system and approach to things. To start though, I&#8217;ve resolved to achieve two goals: (1) Simplify &amp; Focus and (2) Gain back the physical energy that I once had.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Lately, I&#8217;ve noticed that I can&#8217;t seem to get my head in the game. Each move feels more lackluster than the last, and I seem to consistently find myself in do or die situations. I don&#8217;t know if it&#8217;s because I&#8217;m tired, or whether I&#8217;m actually starting to burn out.<br />
With each move I play, it&#8217;s as if I&#8217;m watching a ghost of myself play each move. The tenacity and energy that was once a big part of my game seems to be missing. Unlike other times, there is no obstacle in my way this time. Instead, it is like I am a weary traveler who has succeeded in one part of his journey; but as he stares out at the long road ahead, he can only sit down in bewilderment as he wonders how he will summon the energy necessary to continue onwards.<br />
Taking a break is not an option for me. That is something I know for sure, but figuring out how I will continue from here will certainly be a challenge.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>No worries. I&#8217;m not dead. I apologize for not being able to update on a daily basis for the <a title="North American Go Convention — Day 1" href="//north-american-go-convention-day-1/">NAGC</a>. After Friday, there was just no way I could keep up with writing and the convention at the same time. On the upside though, there will definitely be posts coming in the near future with game reviews and all. So there should be some good content heading your way.<br />
On another note, my brain is rather fried at the moment. So I will probably be taking the rest of the month to take time to gather my thoughts and restructure some things around to reflect some of the insight I&#8217;ve received this past weekend. So for the rest of February, Weekly Go Wednesday will be on a temporary break. Meanwhile, I can assure you that I will be working hard to design a new system for blog content and how I can improve my study of go in order to help you gain a better understanding of my mistakes and lessons learned. Nothing to fear though, I will still be writing frequently and keeping you all posted on my progress. =)</p>
