<p style="text-align: left;">October is upon us and the time for trick or treating is here! Luckily for you, I have yet to come up with any imaginative ways to prank my readers. So until I do, looks like you&#8217;ll be stuck with treats of extra game reviews for this month! xD</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">As I mentioned before, I joined the <a title="Canadian Go League" href="//canadian-go-league/">Canada Go League</a>* recently and so I thought it would be appropriate if I reviewed my games that I played as part of this bonus material. So to start of this month&#8217;s bonus game reviews, we will begin with the first game I played in the Canada Go League.<a href="//wp-content/uploads/2013/10/2013.10.02-October-2013-Bonus-Review-Game-1.sgf"><br />
</a></p>

<p style="text-align: left;">*A little background on the game and structure of the league. All the games are even, and the color that each player plays is determined based on the rank that you submit to the league (or your real life rank if you are part of the Canada Go Association). And since I&#8217;m a big skeptic of ranks being an accurate assessment of one&#8217;s strength, I did not even begin to think that this game would be easy since it was against a &#8220;6 kyu.&#8221; After all, you never know a player&#8217;s true strength till you actually play a game.</p>

<p>For today&#8217;s go meditation, you will witness an even game that I played recently against a 5k opponent. Overall I felt that I handled it quite well, but I will note that I got lucky during a ko fight in the M11 area. You&#8217;ll see what I mean. And though it wasn&#8217;t intentional, the game ended up looking like a yin-yang when we were finished. Kind of amusing. xD<a href="//wp-content/uploads/2013/08/2013.08.05-MGM-21.sgf"><br />

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On Sunday, July 21st, I was able to finally join my friends at <a href="http://www.zhouyuan.com/">Yuan Zhou</a>&#8216;s Monthly Workshop! Though I was originally unable to go, I&#8217;m glad that I was able to make it out!<br />
The day began as always with a tsumego on the demonstration board.<br />
<figure id="attachment_3625" style="width: 122px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2013/07/tsumego.png"><img class=" wp-image-3625 " alt="tsumego problem" src="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2013/07/tsumego.png?resize=122%2C274" width="122" height="274" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Black to play. What is White&#8217;s status?</figcaption></figure>
Though I had the correct answer at one point, I talked myself out of it by misreading the order of moves. As a result, I unfortunately can&#8217;t proudly say I solved it with confidence. Haha. But in terms of what I gained from that experience, I need much more work on my life and death skills. I&#8217;m decent with some of the instinctual moves, but I need to be better in terms of being absolutely sure of my answer.<br />
After my friend Gurujeet answered the question correctly, we moved on to reviewing a professional game between Lee Sedol [9P] and Lian Xiao [4P] ([download label=&#8221;Download Kifu&#8221;]//wp-content/uploads/2013/07/LianLee07212013.sgf[/download]). It was an exciting game that really helped to open my eyes. Some of the major things I learned from the flow and tenacity of the players include:<br />
<span id="more-3614"></span></p>
<ol>
<li><span style="line-height: 13px;">Do not give your opponent an easy time when it comes to figuring out the next move.</span></li>
<li>The strength of a player is actually reflected in his/her ability to handle the center of the board.</li>
<li>When making a move, try to make the follow-up move as severe as possible.</li>
<li>If it&#8217;s not life or death, don&#8217;t fight on your opponent&#8217;s terms.</li>
<li>Always look for a more active way to defend yourself.</li>
</ol>
<p>Afterwards, we had lunch and then got our afternoon matches. Apparently according to AGA, my rating is actually -4.375 now (i.e. 4 kyu), so I got matched up with a fellow UMBC go player by the name of Nathan. We had played against one another at the local club before, but this would be our first ranked match against one another. Below is a record of our game along with some of Yuan Zhou&#8217;s and my thoughts as well.<a href="//wp-content/uploads/2013/07/2013.07.21-Yuan-Zhou-Workshop-Game.sgf"><br />
</a><br />

<div id='glift_display3' style='height:500px; width:100%; position:relative;'></div>
<script type='text/javascript'>gliftWidget = glift.create({"divId":"glift_display3","sgf":"http:\/\/bengozen.com\/\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/07\/2013.07.21-Yuan-Zhou-Workshop-Game.sgf","display":{"theme":"DEFAULT","drawBoardCoords":"1"}});</script>

<p>In hindsight, I am really out of practice when it comes to playing with a clock. I got into byoyomi pretty early but somehow misread the clock as 3 minutes and 30 seconds when it fact it was actually 3 periods of 30 seconds. And to be honest, I didn&#8217;t even realize how little time until I heard the clock voice go, &#8220;1, 2, 3..&#8221; Then it suddenly occurred to me that I was about to lose on time and from that point on when playing in sudden death. Haha.<br />
The funny thing is that I wasn&#8217;t the only one with clock problems. Nathan told me after the game that he misread the clock as well (although he didn&#8217;t get into sudden death the way I did xD). And on top of that, my friends Gurujeet and Diego were so intent on their game that Black ended up losing on time due to some confusion. Haha. Fortunately we are all friends and the environment is a friendly-competitive one, so it was something we could all laugh about afterwards.<br />
My biggest highlight of the day would have to be when Yuan Zhou said &#8220;This may be a local loss, but this keeps with whole board thinking.&#8221; WOOT! One step toward eliminating kyu tunnel vision forever!<br />
At the end of the day however, it was a day full of learning and lots of fun. Big shoutout to Nate, Diego, Gurujeet, and Nathan for making it a blast!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When I decided to go on a ranked game sabbatical, I will tell you right now that I doubted my own abilities to follow through on it. If I could relate it to a person&#8217;s diet, it is as if a carnivore  tries to go vegetarian for a month. For most people, the thought is incredibly daunting and seemingly impossible. Just like ranked games, I wasn&#8217;t sure whether it was entirely possible to go a whole month without playing a single ranked game; but here I am, Day 17, and the differentiation between ranked and free games has become a faint blur. I will be the first to admit that this will not be permanent, but I think this new perspective has allowed my go to be far more creative than before.<br />
The other benefit to playing these free games is that the obsession with winning and losing has also begun to diminish. Most of my games are even games against players that are at least 3 stones stronger, so getting demolished constantly seems to have been good for my go soul. =) On top of it all, when winning and losing becomes more of an afterthought, I find that my games are far more interesting and expand on my current abilities.<br />
Still not convinced? Well, then let me direct your attention to a game I played with a 3k. Hope you enjoy!<br />

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 style="text-align: center;"><em> Weekly Go Wednesday, Issue #10</em></h2>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2012/12/tsuna.png"><img class=" wp-image-1261   aligncenter" title="Tsuna and Reborn" alt="Tsuna and Reborn by Electra" src="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2012/12/tsuna.png?resize=378%2C433" width="378" height="433" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>In almost every game in the universe, as <a title="Yogi Berra Wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yogi_Berra">Yogi Berra</a> once said, &#8220;It&#8217;s not over till it&#8217;s over!&#8221; Players are always forced to play it out till the end regardless of the how poorly they are doing. Granted, players can always quit in the middle of the game; but this is generally considered to be poor taste. While every game of go can theoretically be played out to the end, the ability to resign as an honorable method of admitting defeat brings about a critical component of a player&#8217;s success in the game: fighting spirit.<br />
If you remember a <a title="Perfectly Defeated…" href="//perfectly-defeated/">few posts back</a>, I was in a miserable slump where I was on a losing streak and playing one reckless games after another. With each progressing game, every move became less about the fight for victory and more about mercilessly trying to kill groups while weakening my own. It is the worst form of go possible:<em> emotional go that hopes the opponent will make a mistake</em>. *shakes head side to side*<br />
While the games I played were not necessarily eye-gouge worthy, it ultimately culminated into the shipwreck that is the game below:<br />

<div id='glift_display6' style='height:500px; width:100%; position:relative;'></div>
<script type='text/javascript'>gliftWidget = glift.create({"divId":"glift_display6","sgf":"http:\/\/bengozen.com\/\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/11\/2012.12.12-Fighting-Spirit.sgf","display":{"theme":"DEFAULT","drawBoardCoords":"1"}});</script>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div align ='center'><noscript>Please enable JavaScript to view this game.</noscript> <a href='//wp-content/uploads/2012/11/2012.12.12-Fighting-Spirit.sgf' download>Download SGF</a></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">[download label=&#8221;Download Kifu&#8221;]//wp-content/uploads/2012/11/2012.12.12-Fighting-Spirit.sgf[/download]
<p>Without any context, the game looks as if White resigned a won game for the sake of sandbagging his rank or helping Black gain rank. Yet, the truth is that my vision had become so clouded with defeat that losing the small group in the lower right corner caused me to feel as if I had lost the entire game. I didn&#8217;t even bother to estimate territory, which would have clearly told me not to resign. As you can see, my fighting spirit was not only broken; but there was practically nothing left.<br />
If you&#8217;ve ever seen, read or watched anything of the <a title="Epic Genre Wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epic_%28genre%29">epic genre</a>, you&#8217;ll notice that no matter how strong, smart, or talented they are, the critical element that always allow them to triumph at the end is their fighting spirit. In other words, when things get tough, their fighting spirit is what allows them to find a way out and ultimately succeed. The same can be said of go: no matter how good you are at the various aspects of go (e.g., life and death, tesuji, endgame, etc.), it is all irrelevant if you do not have the fighting spirit to back it up.<br />
Taking a page from the <a title="Energy (Esotericism) Wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_%28esotericism%29">esoteric school of energy</a>, we are all born with different levels of spiritual energy. With that in mind, it would not be far fetched to believe that the same can be said of our fighting spirits. There are some who are born with an excess of fighting spirit, and others who are extremely meek. Fear not though, this is something that you can change. It will require a great deal of deep introspection and the help of those close to you, but I assure you it can be done.<br />
The key concept to keep in mind is that <strong>your fighting spirit is intricately tied to your personality and perspective on life</strong>.  In other words, you are essentially trying to change yourself. On the upside though, the reward you will gain from this endeavor is one that will not only impact your ability and enjoyment of go; but it is one that will have a profound impact on the rest of your life.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Weekly Go Wednesday was built on the idea of weekly articles to help players improve and understand various aspects about the go. After much thought and consideration however, I realized that most players have little interest in what a low SDK has to say in regards to improving at go. As a result, until I have proven that my methods work and gain a the respected dan rank, this will be the final issue of Weekly Go Wednesday for now. Till next time!</em></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So for those who don&#8217;t play on KGS, I actually managed to climb back up to 6k and hang on to it (*knock on wood*). As it is everyday, I had an urge to play a ranked game and decided to play against an opponent who is actually more along the lines of 5k but recently got downgraded to 6k. Although I was resistant to playing him at first, I decided to plunge ahead since I planned on beating stronger opponents anyways.<br />
Let me just say this for the record: <strong>I never quite understood the importance of endgame until this game</strong>.<br />
I mean, sure, everyone &#8220;knows&#8221; that the endgame is important. As I look at the people around me however, I realized that <strong>most kyu players tend to disregard this aspect of go since most of their games are contingent upon big battles which often result in early resignations</strong>. With that in mind, how could you blame them for not paying more attention to endgame?<br />
As I&#8217;m approaching the mid-SDK range, the games that I have played have begun to take on a new form from the big battles I used to fight. While this makes me a bit nervous, this is part of the journey to becoming the strongest player I can possibly be.<br />
The following game is one that I think many of you would find quite interesting since it consists of a rather complicated capturing race and is a great example of why a player&#8217;s endgame skill can be the difference between victory or defeat.<br />

<p>While he ended up resigning due to the capturing race, in reality this game goes down as a defeat in my book. Had I been more careful about my endgame, I&#8217;m quite sure that I would have earned that victory fair and square; but it is clear that my reckless endgame actually cost me the game. This game has really humbled my opinion of my abilities and reminded me how critical it is to:</p>
<ol>
<li>Practice estimating the score so that I do not have a distorted view of the game.</li>
<li>Be more meticulous about my endgame moves since I only get a few opportunities to really practice it.</li>
<li>Continue to practice my reading abilities so that I do not get caught in liberty shortages due to misreading.</li>
</ol>
<p>Here&#8217;s to hoping I have learned my lesson.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;m not sure if anyone else feels this way, but there&#8217;s just something about playing an even game with someone much stronger than you that tends to bring out the best moves in you. And although I did not know this at the time, my game with Tilwen is what I needed to regain my composure and leave behind the reckless go I had been playing.<br />

<p style="text-align: left;">After the game was over, Tilwen gave a fantastic review that really opened my eyes regarding vital concepts that I never quite grasped:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>#1. Attack from far away.</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>#2. Contact moves are for defense.</strong></p>
<p>This may be common sense for many of you, but I assure you that the simplicity of the concepts never occurred to me throughout my study of go. Perhaps it was simply the reinforcement I needed after much studying, but his explanations of these concepts really helped to solidify the concepts. For those who still find these concepts difficult to grasp, just read it over a few time for familiarity and I assure you that I will write an article on these to better clarify them for you.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Many thanks again to Tilwen for his help and advice!</em></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: left;">As a game progresses over time, it is very easy to lose track of the connections between your groups. After all, if you&#8217;re intently staring at the board for a long time, it&#8217;s not so far fetched to start seeing groups being connected when in fact they aren&#8217;t. In fact, if you take a quick look at the kifu snapshot above, it would seem that the top black group is doing alright. Unfortunately, nothing could be further from the truth.</p>
<p><span id="more-7"></span><br />
While I&#8217;ve played a number of games recently where either I or my opponent failed to keep track of our connections, the kifu for today&#8217;s game is one that demonstrates this concept very well. As you go over the kifu, you&#8217;ll notice that for the most part, Black has done a pretty good job keeping all of his groups connected. As a result, White had to be careful about his own connections and determining whether a cut will actually work or not. Unfortunately for Black, the game progressed to a point where he got so caught up in the running battle that he failed to realize that White was aiming to disconnect his group the entire time.<br />
<strong>Remember, it&#8217;s critical that you are never lulled into a false sense of security at any point during the game</strong>. It is precisely during these times that the opponent will find the game changing move to turn the game in his/her favor.<br />
To help you avoid the false sense of security, always be sure to check on the following whenever your opponent makes a move:</p>
<ol>
<li>Are my groups alive?</li>
<li>Are my groups connected at the key locations? Or in another sense, is it easy for my opponent to cut my groups apart and get away with it?</li>
</ol>
<div>If you can answer those questions with confidence, then it is irrelevant whether your reading abilities fall short. You did the basic steps of being sensitive to your stones. The mistakes will come, and you will learn from it. By following this path, you will inevitably get stronger.</div>
<div></div>
<div>And as always, if your groups are fine, the fun part comes when seeing whether or not your opponent&#8217;s groups are prime for attack and even death.</div>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For those who have never tried it before, playing an even game against a player that is reportedly two stones stronger than you can be a scary feeling. On one hand, you think &#8220;This can&#8217;t be too bad.&#8221; Yet, on the other hand, the board looks quite naked as you stare at the empty board while knowing that you should have two handicap stones sitting on the board. As someone who&#8217;s been through a couple experiences recently, it is quite the daunting feeling&#8230;</p>
<div style="text-align: left;"><span id="more-24"></span></div>
<p>Now, I understand that rank is, more often than not, a rather subjective one. A player can be stronger or weaker than his reported rank, and then of course there is the issue of whether your opponent&#8217;s playing style is weak to yours. Nonetheless, especially for players not yet in the high SDK and dan levels, the rank difference ends up impacting your mindset to some degree.<br />
The game was an intense one that left me with a racing heart and slight anxiety that I would misclick as my shaking hands attempted to place each stone. That being said, I am proud to say that today&#8217;s kifu has allowed me to obtain the &#8220;Beat a Stronger Player in an Even Game&#8221; accomplishment! In addition, being able to win against a stronger player in an even game has helped to reinforce my confidence against stronger opponents. Granted, I&#8217;m not saying I believe I can knocking down high SDK&#8217;s with ease; but I am now at least able to stand a bit straighter when faced with stronger opponents.<br />
Finally, today&#8217;s kifu has a special guest appearance from one of my favorite sensei&#8217;s: frozensoul! The kifu has a lot of great commentary and variations that I&#8217;m sure you could benefit from. The key lesson that I took away from his review is the usage of the double hane. If you are still feel a bit confused about that technique, be sure to look over the kifu for that explanation and more!</p>
