				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So today was productive. Two solid games under my belt. Finished <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Nihon Ki-in&#8217;s Handbook of Proverbs</span> and working my way towards the finish line for <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Fundamental Principles of Go</span>. Worked solidly on <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Get Strong at Life and Death</span>.<br />
Outside of trying to create the regimen, I&#8217;m seriously looking into programs in China/Taiwan that would allow Westerners to study Go hardcore for 3 months. Been reading blogs about the program for <a href="http://internetgoschool.com/goinchina.vhtml" target="_blank">Guo Juan Intensive Go Study in China</a>. Very interesting stuff. Will be sure to post more on my thoughts about that when I read more.</p>
<ol>
<li>Problems &#8211; 30 solid minutes.</li>
<li>Theory &#8211; Exemplary.</li>
<li>1 Solid Game &#8211; Completed.</li>
</ol>
<p>Also, it&#8217;s going to sound and look like I&#8217;ve read a ton of Go books. In theory, that means I should be growing exponentially! One little detail though, I&#8217;ve READ them. Comprehension is an ENTIRELY different matter. Once I work through all the ones I want to work through, re-reading and re-reviewing will be occurring. But that seems very far away.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So here ends my Monday.  Overall, there was a lot of progression in terms of how I saw the game and what I know I need to do now.  I just played a free game with a weaker player who, for some reason, only wanted a two stone handicap.  It was definitely different to see such a difference in reading ability.  I mean I know he (or she) is only a 23k and I&#8217;m a 15k, but still&#8230; it wasn&#8217;t till I was playing him that I was like&#8230; Oh&#8230; that&#8217;s how stupid I must look to all the stronger players I&#8217;ve been playing.<br />
Overall.. here are my ratings for the day.</p>
<ol>
<li>Problems &#8211; Minimal</li>
<li>Theory &#8211; Minimal</li>
<li>Games &#8211; Satisfactory</li>
</ol>
<div>Hopefully I&#8217;ll be able to at least to satisfactory on all three on a more consistent basis.</div>

<p><a href="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2010/10/stress-relief-kit.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-826" title="Stress Relief Kit" src="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2010/10/stress-relief-kit.png?resize=264%2C320" alt="" width="264" height="320" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><br />
It seems I can&#8217;t seem to get my wrapped up properly in a game tonight. Every time I try to play online, it has been a miserable game each and every time. I always start out playing solid, and then always seem to mess up later on.<br />
On the upside, playing with Todd and Keith today was insightful and I learned a lot. It&#8217;s still frustrating how little I feel that I&#8217;ve grown in the (almost) two months time frame. I clearly haven&#8217;t been studying as much as I should have been lately. I should probably modify my regimen for improving my abilities.<br />
Five more days until the second month is up&#8230;. sigh&#8230;.</p>
