<p>For this week’s meditation, I’m happy to feature Tilwen back on the blog. Overall, I have to say that I felt I played well; but I completely mishandled the invasion on the top and ended up losing after making mistake after mistake.<br />
This is definitely a great example of how to lose a won game. Hope you enjoy!<br />

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 style="text-align: center;">Introduction</h2>
<p>For this week&#8217;s go meditation, we continue our walk down memory lane. I am a 13 kyu this week and played a game that was very surprising for me. To put it in another sense, I had a hard time believing that I had really played such a game as a 13k! In fact, this game puts some of my games as a SDK (i.e., single digit kyu) to shame. Haha. It makes me wonder what has happened to my go and whether there is something to be said about how I used to play versus how I play now. So much to think about… Anyhow, I hope that you will enjoy this game and find this game as surprising as I did! It seriously is an impressive game for two 13 kyus!<a href="//wp-content/uploads/2013/10/2013.10.28-MGM-33.sgf"><br />

<p style="text-align: center;">When trying to kill a group, be careful not to let your groups get cut up. Otherwise you might find yourself in a dire capturing race that you cannot win.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For your final October Bonus Game Review, you will have the opportunity to witness another one of my Tygem games against a 3d! In all honesty, I was quite surprised at some of the moves I made when I was reviewing it again. Some were quite innovative, while some were quite idiotic. Haha. Hopefully this game will be full of fun and surprises for you as you prepare for your own Halloween celebrations. I hope you have enjoyed this bonus series and hope you have a great Halloween tomorrow!<br />

<p>For today&#8217;s go meditation, you will be able to witness a rather rare occurrence in my games: territorial style! In this game, I try to focus on playing solid moves that focus on taking profit as opposed to killing. Though a few of my moves are rather slow and I make a rather dumb mistake at the very end, I think you&#8217;ll find this game an interesting change of pace from my typical moyo games. Enjoy!<a href="//wp-content/uploads/2013/08/2013.08.05-MGM-21.sgf"><br />

<h2 style="text-align: center;"><strong>One Point Lesson</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: center;"><b> When an opponent is making overplays and trying to live in your sphere of influence, be very careful not to be overconfident and accidentally give your opponent the forcing moves needed to live.</b></p>
