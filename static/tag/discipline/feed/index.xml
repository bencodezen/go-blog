				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 style="text-align: center;">Friday Go Forward: Week 29</h2>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>So I&#8217;m going to change up the format of my progress report in hopes of determining my own training menu and give you better insight into what I&#8217;m doing each week. Instead of an &#8220;Education and Training&#8221; section, I&#8217;ve split it up into &#8220;Training&#8221; and &#8220;Reading Material&#8221; so there is a clear distinction of what I&#8217;m actively doing. My training regimen is far from what I would like it to be at the moment, but my goal this week has been to establish consistent and disciplined habits in order to make continuous gains. I&#8217;m sure I will still find wrinkles in my system as I progress, but the key thing I&#8217;ll have to remember is to always &#8220;fail forward!&#8221;</p>
<h2>Games</h2>
<ul>
<li>KGS &#8211; 3 games</li>
<li>DGS &#8211; 3 ongoing games</li>
<li>Nova &#8211; 2 ongoing games</li>
</ul>
<h2>Daily Training</h2>
<ul>
<li>10 Intermediate Life &amp; Death Problems &#8211; Magic Baduk Go (iPhone)</li>
<li>10 Pages of <em>Jump Level Up 1</em></li>
<li>1 Joseki from <em>Joseki Jeongseok Compass</em></li>
<li>25 Problems from the Get Strong at Go Series.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Reading Material</h2>
<ul>
<li>Finished <em>The Workshop Lectures Volume 4.</em></li>
<li>Finished <i>Get Strong at Joseki 1.</i></li>
<li>Worked on <i>Jump Level Up 1.</i></li>
<li>Worked on <em>Joseki Jeongseok Compass</em>.</li>
<li>Worked on <i>Fight Like a Pro</i>.</li>
</ul>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It occurred to me recently that it seems that all I do is nothing but study, play or write about go. Though I would love that to be the case, I can assure you that it is not the case. I am like any other working soul in society: I have a 9 to 5 job, I live on my own (which means I have to cook, clean, and do all those non-go related chores xD), I have other interests (e.g., web design, coding, tennis, sports, etc.), and I have more familial responsibility than most might care to have. Nonetheless, I have somehow managed to squeeze in go in between all the other things that I care about. Why am I writing about this? Good question.<br />
In most players pursuit to gain another stone, it seems there is an illusion that in order to do so, you must devote all your time and energy the way an insei does. Whether you believe me or not, nothing could be further from the truth.<br />
The reason why I know I can say this with absolute certainty is that most players&#8217; goal is to simply surpass the kyus and successfully live amongst the dan players. In other words, not become a professional. With that in mind, the first step to continuing progress is to realize that progress in go is rarely (if ever) made in leaps and bounds. Similar to building a house, it is important that every level be built with the most solid foundation possible. Otherwise, when the house gets to 4 to 5 stories high, it won&#8217;t take much for the whole thing to come crashing down.<br />
For those who aspire to be professional players, I applaud your tenacity and ambition. In fact, I would have to admit that even I am secretly hoping to rise to the level of a professional. So believe me when I say that the importance of our growth through one solid step at a time is more critical than anyone else. After all, professionals play at a level where the slightest mistake (such as the timing of one forcing move over another) can make the difference between winning and losing.<br />
To those frustrated with their progress, remember that go is a never ending journey where new ideas will constantly be born. The moment we think we know what we&#8217;re doing and have some new &#8220;sure-win&#8221; strategy, someone will come along and blow it away. So just keep at it with an unrelenting discipline to study (even if only for 10 minutes a day) and to focus on playing inspired games where you learn something rather than simply winning. Once you&#8217;ve grasped that, the depth and bottomless pit of wisdom that go has to offer will open its doors to you.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Recently, I have been trying to figure out how to resolve my problem of being undisciplined when it comes to reading out sequences or figuring out what move to play next.<br />
One of the first solutions I came up with was to simply try and practice more problems, but it didn&#8217;t really seem to help much. So the next thing I tried was reading more theoretical go books in hopes of having something click inside me that would all of a sudden fix my problem. That didn&#8217;t work out too well either.<br />
After some thought, I realized that my problem is actually multidimensional.</p>
<ol>
<li><span style="line-height: 13px;"><strong>Physical Energy</strong> &#8211; I have been a lot more tired than I would like to admit lately. Though I didn&#8217;t recognize it at the time, it was playing a major role in my being nonchalant about what or where I played next.  </span></li>
<li><strong>Multiple Points of Focus</strong> &#8211; Those who know me personally will attest to the fact that I am the type who is constantly trying to multi-task and can jump from one thing to another in a blink of an eye. While that can be useful in certain contexts, it is actually becoming detrimental to my go in the long run (along with other things, but let&#8217;s face it, go is the first priority here. =P).</li>
<li><strong>Overload / Burnout</strong> &#8211; As a result of the previous two points, it is only natural that my brain would eventually become overloaded and simply burnout.</li>
</ol>
<p>It&#8217;s clear that I need a reboot on my system and approach to things. To start though, I&#8217;ve resolved to achieve two goals: (1) Simplify &amp; Focus and (2) Gain back the physical energy that I once had.</p>
