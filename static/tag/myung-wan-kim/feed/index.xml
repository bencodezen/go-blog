<p>When I woke up, I realized that today was the last day of Congress. Man, where had all the time gone? It seemed like just yesterday I boarded the train with my brother to embark on an epic journey to New York.<br />
The morning consisted of grabbing breakfast and checking out this cool place called <a title="The High Line" href="http://www.thehighline.org/">The High Line</a> that Anders recommended the night before. Luckily for us, it was still beautiful weather so we had a great time exploring the sights.<br />
<a href="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/10/2014GC-D07-02.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5829" src="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/10/2014GC-D07-02.jpg?resize=600%2C800" alt="2014GC-D07-02" width="600" height="800" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><br />
Around lunch, I got a call from Myung letting me know that Jung, Evan, Mark, and him wanted to try a steakhouse in NY before they left. So after meeting up with them at the hotel, we went off to look for one. We found one not too far: <a title="Wolfgang's Steakhouse Yelp" href="http://www.yelp.com/menu/wolfgangs-steakhouse-manhattan-3">Wolfgang Steakhouse</a>.<br />
<span id="more-5816"></span><br />
One of the items that caught my eye on the menu was a $200 steak (to be shared by 4 people). We had five people though, so I didn’t suggest it. Instead everyone went with their Wolfgang’s Steakhouse from their lunch menu.<br />
<figure id="attachment_5819" style="width: 800px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/10/2014GC-D07-04.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-5819" src="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/10/2014GC-D07-04.jpg?resize=720%2C540" alt="Look at the size of that thing!" width="720" height="540" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Look at the size of that thing! And they really got the medium rare down perfectly!</figcaption></figure>
To be honest, I was expecting to get a small piece of steak for the $30 we were paying, but it was HUGE! And though you don&#8217;t see any sides in this picture, there was large sides of mashed potatoes and spinach for everyone to share. To say the least, everyone was very satisfied with lunch. Haha.<br />
After being stuffed with a delicious lunch, Myung had to go attend to some matters; so I was left in charge of helping to guide the rest of the group around New York. So for the rest of the afternoon, we explored Time Square and had a lot of fun seeing all the fun things going on in the city.<br />
Soon it was time for us to return for the awards banquet though. And when we arrived, everyone went to their respective rooms to get ready (except for me). As I looked around for everyone, I noticed that Satoru wasn’t present. Unfortunately, I found out that he had already left and thus we would be unable to say goodbye in person. Nonetheless, it was great seeing him and I certainly hope to see him again in the near future!<br />
Finally it was time for us to enter the banquet hall.<br />
<a href="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/10/2014GC-D07-06.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5820" src="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/10/2014GC-D07-06.jpg?resize=600%2C800" alt="2014GC-D07-06" width="600" height="800" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><br />
<a href="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/10/2014GC-D07-08.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5822" src="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/10/2014GC-D07-08.jpg?resize=600%2C800" alt="2014GC-D07-08" width="600" height="800" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><br />
<img class="aligncenter wp-image-5821 size-full" src="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/10/2014GC-D07-07.jpg?resize=720%2C540" alt="2014GC-D07-07" width="720" height="540" data-recalc-dims="1" /><br />
The menu consisted of pasta with cheese and tomato sauce, chicken fingers, cookies, brownies, bread and drinks. Considering the places I had been eating the entire week, I have to admit I was a little disappointed. However, I just want to stress that I understand that we were primarily paying for the space and not for a top notch meal. So while I was a little disappointed, it was just a personal feeling at the time and not some reflection on the event itself.<br />
<a href="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/10/2014GC-D07-09.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5823" src="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/10/2014GC-D07-09.jpg?resize=720%2C540" alt="2014GC-D07-09" width="720" height="540" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><br />
The awards ceremony was fun though. For a summary of friends who placed:</p>
<ul>
<li>Diego and Terri both placed second in their respective divisions!</li>
<li>Mark Lee went undefeated and won 1st place!</li>
</ul>
<p>A huge congratulations to them on an awesome performance!<br />
Once all the awards had been announced, I realized that this would probably be the last time I would have a chance to talk to the professionals and went to say my final goodbyes and get some pictures taken with them.<br />

<p style="text-align: left;">Hey everyone! Welcome to Part I of my awesome experience at the 1st Washington Open Baduk Championship this past weekend! Though many of you already know the results of the tournament, I&#8217;ll start by asking you all to refrain from commenting on the actual result till Part II since some don&#8217;t know yet.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">In addition, I&#8217;m sure that many of you are eager to see what kind of games I played, so I have gone ahead and uploaded the kifu for your enjoyment. Commentary will come in future Monday Go Meditations (which I will note for each game); but hopefully you will forgive me for not being to add commentary within such a short time.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">With that said, let&#8217;s get started!</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span id="more-5140"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">To start, even though the tournament officially started on Saturday, I had the pleasure of getting to hangout and spend time with Myung Wang Kim (9p) and Park Sohyun (3p) on Friday. (In case some of you didn&#8217;t know, I got to know Myung at the <a title="North American Go Convention — Day 2" href="//north-american-go-convention-day-2/">North American Go Convention</a> last year.) After letting them do some exploring, we got dinner at a nearby Korean restaurant with some distinguished guests and ate delicious food.*</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><em>*Many thanks to our gracious hosts for footing the bill that night. It was a wonderful meal and was full of great conversation and great company.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Around the time dinner was wrapping up, I noticed that some of the guests were speaking to Myung in Korean. It seemed as if they were inviting him somewhere, and I was a little sad at the prospect of having to part ways so early in the evening; but to my great surprise, Myung then turned to me and asked if I would be interested in going with them to the local Korean baduk club?</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Me? Interested in visiting a local Korean baduk club? Absolutely!</p>
<figure id="attachment_5156" style="width: 448px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014-WOpen-02.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-5156" alt="2014-WOpen-02" src="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014-WOpen-02.jpg?resize=448%2C448" width="448" height="448" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Here&#8217;s a shot of the inside of the club. I refrained from taking any direct pictures of people playing since I didn&#8217;t want anyone feeling uncomfortable from me doing so.</figcaption></figure>
<p style="text-align: left;">When we walked into the club, it was amazing for me to see so many gorgeous boards and bowls sitting in one room. And to top it off, there were people playing! So cool! Granted, they all spoke Korean with one another so I was rather lost when it came to what they were talking about. However, it was nice to just bask in the atmosphere and while hearing the pleasant sound of the stones clicking on the board.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">After some time, we said our goodbyes and I took them back to their hotel so that they could rest since we had to be up early the next day.</p>
<figure id="attachment_5157" style="width: 358px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014-WOpen-03.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-5157" alt="2014-WOpen-03" src="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014-WOpen-03.jpg?resize=358%2C478" width="358" height="478" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">This was the banner you were greeted with when you walked out of the elevator.</figcaption></figure>
<p style="text-align: left;">Before I knew it, the momentous day had arrived. It was officially the first day of the 1st Washing Open Baduk Championship!</p>
<figure id="attachment_5158" style="width: 512px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014-WOpen-04.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-5158" alt="2014-WOpen-04" src="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014-WOpen-04.jpg?resize=512%2C384" width="512" height="384" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Look at all the people registering! And I got there pretty early too!</figcaption></figure>
When I arrived in the lobby for registration, I was pleasantly surprised to see so many people waiting in line! &#8220;Hoorah!&#8221; I thought, &#8220;Hopefully this will help convince the sponsors* to continue doing this again next year!&#8221;<br />
<em>*In case you didn&#8217;t know, this tournament was being hosted and sponsored by a number of Korean companies (you can see their logos above in the first banner) and featured a number of awesome perks like free entry fee, free lunch on both days, and even cash prizes).</em><br />
<figure id="attachment_5159" style="width: 512px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014-WOpen-05.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-5159" alt="2014-WOpen-05" src="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014-WOpen-05.jpg?resize=512%2C384" width="512" height="384" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">The sight of a room full of gobans and stones with people playing / discussing variations is always a great joy.</figcaption></figure>
<p style="text-align: left;">When I arrived in the playing room, I was also glad to already see a number of people already sitting and getting acclimated to the area. And as you can see, we were adequately prepared for a large number of players!</p>
<figure id="attachment_5160" style="width: 410px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014-WOpen-06.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-5160" alt="2014-WOpen-06" src="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014-WOpen-06.jpg?resize=410%2C546" width="410" height="546" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Here&#8217;s the schedule for both days. And if you&#8217;re wondering what&#8217;s in the upper right, they had Wi-Fi for everyone as well (which was awesome if I may say so myself).</figcaption></figure>
After a bit of waiting and catching up with various friends, the pairings were finally up. It was the fateful moment that you either dread or wait with anticipation when any tournament rolls around: the first round! The game that will set the stage for the rest of the tournament!<br />
My opponent was an older Chinese man who might have been in his fifties to sixties. He was a 3 kyu and the game was set as even with White getting 7.5 komi. The time settings were 1 hour main time per person with 20 moves per 5 minutes byoyomi.<br />
After exchanging customary greetings and fussing with the clocks for a bit, we started our game. The kifu below is our game. (The commentary version will be Monday Go Meditation: Game 60)<br />

<p style="text-align: left;">Though the game ended up being dramatic, I will have to say that I tried to play a calm and patient game as much as I could. (The idea originates from <a title="Maaike's April Challenge" href="http://www.thegochallenge.blogspot.com.au/2014/04/april-challenge.html">Maaike&#8217;s April Challenge</a>). As you saw, I ended up letting an advantageous position turn into a complete disaster. It was only by sheer patience and luck that I was able to turn it around. The game was one of the longest ones that round. It took more than two hours for us to finish and I used 3 periods of overtime.* Needless to say I was relieved to win, but I was exhausted afterwards as I went off to grab lunch.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><em>*On a side note, I just wanted to rant about how chess clocks are AWFUL for Canadian byoyomi because you end up spending more time trying to figure out whether the flag is about to tip instead of focusing on your move. So you end up playing super fast moves for fear of losing on time. Stressful I tell you!</em></p>

Once everyone had eaten lunch, we had our opening ceremony (which seems a little backwards since the event already started, but it was necessary because the VIP guests could not arrive earlier).<br />
<figure id="attachment_5162" style="width: 512px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014-WOpen-08.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-5162" alt="2014-WOpen-08" src="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014-WOpen-08.jpg?resize=512%2C384" width="512" height="384" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">You can see them giving speeches up front and everyone being respectful and listening.</figcaption></figure>
After the ceremony was done, it was time for Round 2. My opponent this time was a Chinese woman in her forties to fifties and a 2 kyu. Since I won the first round though, there would be no handicap and White would still get 7.5 points.*<br />
<em>*In AGA tournaments, it seems that they calculate handicaps not based on rank but on your performance in the tournament as it progresses. </em><br />
Before the game started, I decided I would continue to try and play a calm game. The kifu below is the result. (The commentary version will be Monday Go Meditation: Game 61)<br />

<p style="text-align: left;">To be honest, I thought that I was ahead for most of the game. I thought I had done a good job securing territory and keeping White&#8217;s territory small. However, I never actually counted and only did rough estimations.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">My game took long as usual (though not as long as the first round) and there were a few people watching my game when it came time to counting. To my shock and disappointment (though probably not to your surprise), I was actually behind by 20+ points. My opponent was kind enough to try and say I was very strong and that she thought she was losing, but the defeat stung still stung quite a bit.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">After the game, I did my best to try and pick myself back up. After all, it&#8217;s just one loss right? My record was 1-1 now. No big deal. Just brush it off and play better the next round. However, Round 3 was upon me before I knew it (since there was no real break between the rounds).</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">At the end of the last round, I mentioned that there were a few people watching towards the end. One of those was the gentleman that I would end up playing this round. He was also a Chinese man in his forties to fifties and was a 4 kyu. In this game however, I would receive give him a 1 stone handicap and only got 0.5 komi.

<p>It was an awful game. My stamina had already been spent with the first round. So with that and the fact that I was still rattled by my loss in Round 2, I could not keep calm and played one of the worst games I&#8217;ve played to date. Complete overplays and getting into fights I had no business getting into.<br />
Resigning within 100 moves&#8230; My record was now 1-2&#8230; Needless to say, I was upset and really disappointed with myself.<br />
After the game, I took Myung back to the hotel so he could get some rest before the lecture that night. We talked some in the car and I was given a lot to think about. I then went off to eat dinner by myself before it was time to pick him up again.<br />
<figure id="attachment_5163" style="width: 512px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014-WOpen-09.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-5163" alt="2014-WOpen-09" src="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014-WOpen-09.jpg?resize=512%2C384" width="512" height="384" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Unfortunately I only got one shot of Myung during his lecture, but I guess it&#8217;s better than nothing. (Would have preferred to have gotten one when there were stones on the board, but I was too focused on the lecture to remember to take another one.)</figcaption></figure>
After picking him up, we went back to the convention and Myung lectured on a joseki that had recently been created by young Korean professionals. A lot of it went over my head, but it was very cool to see how go is constantly evolving and changing.<br />
Once the lecture was finished, the crowd dispersed into different groups. A blitz tournament was about to start. And though I had originally planned on participating, I was not feeling up to it and decided not to. After all, today had been a rather disturbing revelation of the limitations of my go. I played one decent game and then proceeded to crash and burn&#8230;<br />
Earlier during the lecture, I had seen Park Sohyun (3p) come in and then leave the room with one of the VIP with a board and stones. While some people went up to ask Myung some questions, I decided to go check and see what she was up to. As I prepared to walk around, the following quotation from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/First-Kyu-Sung-Hwa-Hong/dp/0964479699">First Kyu</a> popped in my head:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;First kyu, a player of the first rank? Really? Have you ever competed in a professional qualifying tournament? No? Then you are not, I repeat NOT first kyu!<br />
I know I know. Nowadays all kinds of bad players call themselves first kyu.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8220;Maybe I&#8217;m just a fake 3 kyu,&#8221; I thought as I walked to find her, &#8220;Perhaps I was too naive and arrogant in thinking I could compete, let alone win, as a 3 kyu&#8230;&#8221;</p>

<p>For my final day at the NAGC, I woke up a little later since I was pretty tired from the past four days. After all, on top of all the go and staying out late, I had been working as well. So when I found out that the first round was starting at 8:30am, I decided to forgo competing all together and just get there later for the pro events.<br />
When I arrived, it was approximately 9:15am. As I looked at the schedule for the day, I noticed that the pro events were once again scheduled during the second half of each round. In addition, there were no breaks in between the rounds. If you wanted lunch or dinner, you had better hope your match ends early. So in short, trying to compete, have your meals, and attend pro events would nearly kill you.<br />
Since the first pro event was starting at 10;00am, I went ahead and walked upstairs to see how the tournament was progressing. You can imagine my surprise when I arrived at the playing room to find that they needed another player since someone didn&#8217;t show up. Since there was still some time before the match and I felt bad that someone was missing an opponent, I decided to go ahead and play to help out. Since there was only 30 minutes before the pro event though, I tried to play as quickly as I could with the most aggressive method possible so that the game could possibly end early.<br />
<span id="more-1934"></span><br />
Like I predicted, there was no chance of us finishing the game before the pro event. And to be honest, I can&#8217;t blame my opponent for wanting to take his time to see if he could actually manage to live. With the amount of fighting left to do, I would even be willing to bet that we still had a good 30 &#8211; 45 minutes left before we were close to finishing. So when the time came, there was no choice to resign. Below is the game record.<br />

<div id='glift_display4' style='height:500px; width:100%; position:relative;'></div>
<script type='text/javascript'>gliftWidget = glift.create({"divId":"glift_display4","sgf":"http:\/\/bengozen.com\/\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/02\/2013.02.21-NAGC-Day-5-Game-1.sgf","display":{"theme":"DEFAULT","drawBoardCoords":"1"}});</script>

<p>I will admit that I part of me wanted to see how the game might&#8217;ve ended, but I knew I was playing a rather high risk approach and could very well have lost anyways. So all in all, I was happy to give my opponent the win since I wasn&#8217;t going to win any awards anyways. =D<br />
When the time came from the simul game with Myung, as one might expect with the schedule that day, I was the only one who showed up. So, in order to try and make things for interesting for him, we decided to do a 9 stone handicap where I could put the stones anywhere I wanted.<br />
At first, I set up a setting relatively similar to your standard 9 stone handicap formation with a chance in regards to using a Chinese opening; but then Myung suggested it might be better for me to secure a couple of corners to begin with. I think he soon regretted his suggestion however, because when he looked at the board again and was about to play his first move, he said, &#8220;Oh man&#8230; this is going to make it a lot harder.&#8221;<br />

<div id='glift_display5' style='height:500px; width:100%; position:relative;'></div>

<p>When I played that final move, you have no idea the relief and rush of excitement I felt when I heard him say, &#8220;Oh! Good! You saw that!&#8221; and then put down his stone and focus his attention on the three players who had come in after we had started. So while my 9 stone handicap was a free placement style, this was a huge moment for me because I actually managed to win against a professional. It helped to renew my confidence in myself to feel growth over the past five days.<br />
Afterwards, Myung and I went to pick up James and grabbed lunch at Cosi&#8217;s. We had fun talking about all sorts of random things, but tennis was a pretty big topic and it was fun finding out their different styles and such. I had no idea that there are certain types of racket strings that were specialized for specific playing styles! Definitely a fun time.<br />
When we got back, it was time another lecture from Myung. This time we reviewed part of the 1st game from the Samsung Cup between Lee Sedol and Gu Li. The concept was a bit more abstract this time around. James and I discussed it while we played later on, so I feel like I have a better understanding of it. Granted, like the rest of the lectures from this convention, it will probably take some time before I get write a solid article on it.<br />
For the final pro event, I had to make a choice between attending another lecture by Myung or play a simul game with Stephanie Yin (1P).<br />
<figure id="attachment_1998" style="width: 300px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2013/02/stephanieyin.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1998" alt="Stephanie (Ming Ming) Yin (1P)" src="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2013/02/stephanieyin.jpg?resize=300%2C207" width="300" height="207" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Stephanie (Ming Ming) Yin (1P)</figcaption></figure>
After a bit of thought, I decided that I didn&#8217;t want to pass up the opportunity to play another pro. So with that said, I sat down for my final simul game of the NAGC. Below is the game record.<br />

<div id='glift_display6' style='height:500px; width:100%; position:relative;'></div>
<script type='text/javascript'>gliftWidget = glift.create({"divId":"glift_display6","sgf":"http:\/\/bengozen.com\/\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/02\/2013.02.21-NAGC-Day-5-Game-3.sgf","display":{"theme":"DEFAULT","drawBoardCoords":"1"}});</script>

<p>When the game was over, Stephanie told me that she definitely thought I was stronger than 6 kyu. She recommended I further practice my life and death and reading, and I would progress very quickly. ^.^ It made me happy to hear that and I was very grateful for her compliment and advice.<br />
With all the events over, Myung, James and I tried to see if we could grab a bite to eat before the awards ceremony. Unfortunately there just didn&#8217;t seem to be enough time, but we decided that we would get food afterwards.<br />
The award ceremony room was decorated quite nicely with various flags and all the glass trophies up front. In addition, they managed to fill the entire lecture hall and more with people, which was rather impressive.<br />
There were all kinds of awards, but the most coveted ones went to a number of players from China who participated. I would be lying if I said I wasn&#8217;t the least bit envious and curious as to how I might have fared in the competition, but trust me when I say I do not regret my decision to not compete. Haha.<br />
For the final night of the NAGC, Myung, James and I went back to Bonchon for one last hurrah. Like a blur, all the food and good conversation was suddenly over. Before I knew it, I was dropping them off outside their hotel. With a firm handshake and an assurance that we&#8217;d be in touch, we parted ways for the final time.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center;"><a title="North American Go Convention!!!" href="//north-american-go-convention/">Introduction</a> &#8212; <a title="North American Go Convention — Day 1" href="//north-american-go-convention-day-1/">Day 1</a> &#8212; <a title="North American Go Convention — Day 2" href="//north-american-go-convention-day-2/">Day 2</a> &#8212; <a title="North American Go Convention — Day 3" href="//north-american-go-convention-day-3/">Day 3</a> &#8212; <strong>Day 4</strong> &#8212; <a title="North American Go Convention — Day 5" href="//north-american-go-convention-day-5/">Day 5</a> &#8212; <a title="North American Go Convention — Conclusion" href="//north-american-go-convention-conclusion/">Conclusion</a></p>
<p><em>For Day 4, I had the honor of having my mom come and join me for the day! She just learned the rules recently and I was excited when she told me that she wanted to come to an all day go convention!! Woot!!</em><br />
When we arrived at the convention, I was pleasantly surprised to see a lot of people at the registration room. As we settled down, I heard an announcement that everyone needed to check in if they wanted to compete. At the time, I was rather split as to what to do. On one hand, I wasn&#8217;t sure what the schedule for the professional events (i.e. lectures, simul games, reviews) was. In addition, I wasn&#8217;t sure I was okay with the idea of my mom sitting around for hours on end watching me play games when she was still so new to the game.<br />
Once registration was finished, I thought it would be a good idea to show my mom what competitive go looks like. Upon our arrival upstairs, we found them posting up the pairings for the first round. For some reason, I had a feeling that I might have been included even though I did not check in. Sure enough, I found my name after a quick glance at the list.<br />
<span id="more-1932"></span><br />
Shortly afterwards, I noticed that they posted up the schedule for the day and saw that the professional events had been scheduled at the end of Round 1 and 3. To clarify though, I do not mean that the events were scheduled after the rounds were over. In fact, they were scheduled at the tail end of the round time which meant that if I wanted to attend a pro event, I would face one of two situations: (1) I play in every round, but I&#8217;m forced to rush and hope that the game ends before the event. (2) I play every round, but end up resigning most of my games since I like to take my time with each move anyways.<br />
As I stood there trying to figure out what to do, my opponent found me. After panicking for a moment, I quickly found the tournament director and tried to tell him that I was not going to be playing (at least in the first round). Coincidentally, a fellow go player who was around our level had shown up late and so I tried to get the director to make a swap since it would keep the pairings equal. There was a bit of resistance at first, and it took quite a bit of back and forth before  they resolved the situation amongst themselves.<br />
In my defense though, I never checked in as they told us to do in order to be paired, so why would should I expect to be included? Not to mention, I was not in the mood to showing my mom a rushed game where I don&#8217;t play my best. And if that weren&#8217;t enough, I would probably end up resigning all my games since the pro events were during the rounds. So why make the day extra stressful and draining? No thank you.<br />
While we waited for the simul game with Myung to start, my mom and I had the pleasure of chatting with a local player (by the name of Mr. Choi) who was a director of some sort at a local Korean Baduk club. We found out that he was a 7 dan amateur who had won numerous competition in the United States before and enjoyed teaching go. In fact, we seemed to get along so well that he even started a teaching game with me. Haha.<br />
We only got a few moves into the game before it was time to start the simul game though. And before I knew it, I was sitting once again before Myung as I placed 9 stones on the board. With a renewed spirit from my defeat on <a title="North American Go Convention — Day 3" href="//north-american-go-convention-day-3/">Day 3</a>, it was time to try again! Ikuzo!<br />

<p>Once the game was over, Mr. Choi, Myung, my mom and I went out to grab lunch at <a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/el-pollo-rico-arlington">El Pollo Ricco</a> and had a delicious lunch!<br />
<figure id="attachment_1973" style="width: 300px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2013/02/elpolloricco.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1973" alt="elpolloricco" src="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2013/02/elpolloricco.jpg?resize=300%2C225" width="300" height="225" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Credit to Yelp (Andrew C.)</figcaption></figure>
<p style="text-align: left;">Afterwards, we drove Myung back to the hotel so he could rest for the afternoon. Since we were going to pick him up later on and there were no pro events for the rest of the afternoon, my mom and I just went to a nearby mall to hangout. While it was a detour from the &#8220;all-day go convention,&#8221; we had some great conversation and the thought that I could be at the go convention instead never crossed my mind.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Later on that day, after picking Myung and James up, I found myself sitting in my first professional lecture. Myung was giving a lecture on the final game between Lee sedol and Gu Li in the recent Samsung Cup. Even though we were only able to really spend time on the opening (and a little bit of endgame), it was a really interesting review that definitely opened my eyes to some new ideas. I&#8217;ll be sure to write more about them when I&#8217;ve managed to digest them and can write them in a comprehensible fashion. One thing I can say for sure though, is that my appreciation for pro lectures has definitely grown since then!</p>
<p>With the day coming to an end, I thought that it would be a good idea to take Myung and James out to a local Vietnamese restaurant that we love called <a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/viet-royale-falls-church">Viet Royale</a> (FYI. The Yelp reviews do not do the restaurant justice. I don&#8217;t think people know what to order. =D). I wish I had taken pictures of all the food we ordered, but it is suffice to say that it was full of delicious food and great conversation.<br />

All in all, it was a fantastic day full of great company and great memories. Here&#8217;s to hoping that Day 5 will live up to even 50% of it!</p>

<p>Shortly before leaving the convention on <a title="North American Go Convention — Day 2" href="//north-american-go-convention-day-2/">Day 2</a>, I had mentioned to Myung and James that if they were free and didn&#8217;t have plans, I would be happy to take them out to dinner since they didn&#8217;t know the area very well. They told me that they would let me know how their schedule was the next day, so you can imagine how excited I was when I received a phone call letting me know that they would like to get dinner with me! Since they were in the Annandale area, I suggested that we meet at the Bonchon to get dinner.<br />
As per usual, the traffic to Virginia was not cooperating with me as I attempted to make my way to them. When I finally reached my destination, I arrived to find Myung and James outside with a local Korean go player. I was a bit bewildered at first as to why they were outside, but then I realized that the Bonchon was closed!!! Bleh. Definitely not what I anticipated. So we adapted and headed off to the Fairfax location.<br />

<p style="text-align: center;"><em>If you&#8217;ve never had it before, it&#8217;s just heavenly&#8230;. Just thinking about it is making me hungry&#8230;.</em></p>
<p>Before I knew it, we were munching and chatting the night away. Time passed us by rather quickly because before we knew it it was 7:00pm and we needed to rush back to the convention. Fortunately we weren&#8217;t too far away, but I did feel bad that I didn&#8217;t do a better job keeping track of the time. Since we were running a behind though, we went ahead and dropped Myung off before heading off to do a coffee run.<br />
Once we got back and arrived at the building, we ran into a local go player who had stopped by for the convention but was leaving since there were only dans upstairs. When James hit the button to go to the 9th floor and nothing happened, you can imagine my face as I could only laugh as I realized that we would have to take the stairs once again. On the upside, having James helped to make the climb pass by much quicker.<br />
<span id="more-1929"></span><br />
When we finally arrived on the 9th floor, I was relieved to see familiar faces and the tournament room in clear sight. As we made our way into the tournament room, I saw that Myung was already in the middle of two simul games. At first I wasn&#8217;t sure if we would be too late to join, but before I knew it James took a seat and setup his handicap stones. I quickly followed suit and before I knew it, I was playing my third official professional simul game (the second one with Joanne Missingham doesn&#8217;t count since it never finished and was played in a more blitz manner than anything else). Below is the game record from that night:<br />

<p>After I resigned, I spent a good 10 minutes going over the game and looking at Myung&#8217;s responses. I could only marvel in their simplicity as I tried to make my way through the game I had just played. I didn&#8217;t get too far because James and I decided to play a game together while Myung was focusing on his simul games. James is around 2 kyu, so I think the game took him by surprise when he learned my fighting abilities were not quite the same as a typical meek 6 kyu. I don&#8217;t have the game record for that night, but it was a fun game that was full of experiment and new ideas. =) Once all was said and done though, it seemed that Myung and James&#8217; ride still had things he needed to do, so I was more than happy to give them a ride back to their hotel.<br />
Once I dropped them off, I realized that I probably needed to get gas before heading home. I was a bit frustrated with past me for procrastinating this task because finding a gas station at 11:30pm is not very easy to do. My GPS was great at finding nearby gas stations, only they were all closed. (&gt;.&lt;) So after driving around for 15 minutes and burning more gas, I decided that it would be better to take my chances of getting home than getting stranded in the middle of Virginia. Fortunately for me, I ran into an open gas station before getting on a highway. So glad to know that I would not end the night stranded on the highway. Whew.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center;"><a title="North American Go Convention!!!" href="//north-american-go-convention/">Introduction</a> &#8212; <a title="North American Go Convention — Day 1" href="//north-american-go-convention-day-1/">Day 1</a> &#8212; <strong>Day 2</strong> &#8212; <a title="North American Go Convention — Day 3" href="//north-american-go-convention-day-3/">Day 3</a> &#8212; <a title="North American Go Convention — Day 4" href="//north-american-go-convention-day-4/">Day 4</a> &#8212; <a title="North American Go Convention — Day 5" href="//north-american-go-convention-day-5/">Day 5</a> &#8212; <a title="North American Go Convention — Conclusion" href="//north-american-go-convention-conclusion/">Conclusion</a></p>
<p>Although the weather was much nicer this time around, it seems the fates were conspiring against me as I spent a good twenty minutes stuck in traffic due to an accident. Fortunately for me, I had left early enough that the delay was not going to make me incredibly late. On top of that, based on my experience yesterday, I didn&#8217;t have good reason to believe that arriving late would cause me to miss anything nor should I have worried that a huge crowd of people would suddenly appear on a Thursday night. Nonetheless, I still couldn&#8217;t help but feel anxious that I would arrive to find that the teaching/simultaneous games had started or were full.<br />
By the time I parked my car, it was about 3 minutes prior to 7pm. I rushed into the building fully expecting to grab the first elevator and make it there just on time. Lo and behold, what do I see when I walk in the lobby? The elevators are being maintained. In case you&#8217;re not getting the full effect of what I felt, remember that the convention is on the 9th floor. (-.-)<br />
Next thing I know, I&#8217;m bolting up 9 flights (although more like 18 since they were two flights per level) of stairs in a rush to get there on time. And when I finally make it up to the 9th floor, I am crestfallen as I look around and fail to see anyone around. The room that was setup for go lecture was full of employees holding a meeting, and the room where the we played our simul game yesterday was completely covered up.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">&#8220;CRAP. Did I miss the memo about it getting cancelled or the address moving?!?!?!&#8221;</p>
<p><span id="more-1915"></span><br />
Panic mode started to set in as I thought back to the fact I just rushed up all those stairs and might actually be in the wrong place. Gah!!! After a couple of calls in hopes of getting in contact with someone (which were all failures), I stood around a bit helpless and frustrated as I thought I had missed something. Fortunately, I did not leave in a big rush because I see someone who looks like they are associated with the convention walking around and he lets me in (the doors to the office are locked from the elevator lobby).<br />
When I&#8217;m outside the go room, I find out that Joanne Missingham is being interviewed (by a group that I cannot remember right now). I breathed the biggest sigh of relief as I realized that I had not missed anything and that nothing was cancelled. Since it didn&#8217;t seem like anyone was there yet, I sat outside in the hall listening to music and practicing some easy tsumego problems. After 20 minutes or so, I notice that some of the staff are looking for an overflow room in case a lot of people show up. They never come back to the interview area, so I figure that they must have found it.<br />
I walk around and end up finding everyone sitting in the waiting area enjoying iced tea. I hesitated for a moment before joining them, but realized that it was probably in my best interest to wait with them since they will be the first to find out if anything is starting. To my great surprise, the next thing I know I am being introduced to Myung Wan Kim (9P) and his friend James.<br />
<figure id="attachment_1922" style="width: 241px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2013/02/MyungwanKim.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1922" alt="Myung Wan Kim (9P)" src="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2013/02/MyungwanKim.jpg?resize=241%2C300" width="241" height="300" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Myung Wan Kim (9P)</figcaption></figure>
After the basic introductions and finding out I was 6 kyu, Myung asked me if I had a game for him to review. I was a bit taken aback at first since I did not expect such an incredible opportunity, but told him I did and started getting my iPad out. In the middle of getting my iPad however, the conversation somehow turned into wondering if we could play on my iPad. And without missing a beat I responded, &#8220;Of course!&#8221; (Thank you SmartGo Kifu!!!!!) Myung then suggested that I play with James and then he would review the game afterwards. Words cannot describe how excited I was to hear him suggest that.<br />
We were about 11 moves in when we were interrupted and asked if we would be willing to play with Joanne. The interviewers wanted to get some footage of Joanne playing amateurs. Play with Joanne? Possibly be part of some interview footage? Yes please!<br />
In a whirlwind change of events, I suddenly find myself in front of Joanne once again. Earlier in the day, I thought that I might ask if it would be okay to play an even game with her since I wanted to see how she would play under non-handicap circumstances. With the video recording and all though, I thought it best just to play at 4 stones again. Below is a partial record of the game since I thought the game was more for show than for a serious game, so this was the best I could do with the recreation in the midst of all the craziness.<br />

<div id='glift_display9' style='height:500px; width:100%; position:relative;'></div>
<script type='text/javascript'>gliftWidget = glift.create({"divId":"glift_display9","sgf":"http:\/\/bengozen.com\/\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/02\/2013.02.15-NAGC-Day-2.sgf","display":{"theme":"DEFAULT","drawBoardCoords":"1"}});</script>

<p>We got a little further than my record, but the game was ended prematurely in order to allow the interviewers to get other footage.<br />
As everyone took a break and went off to get a drink and such, I stood around wondering what would happen next. After all, it seemed that Joanne was rather busy with the interview and was clearly in high demand. A tournament was out of the question since I was one of two local players who came. So, what would happen the rest of the night?<br />
Before I could think too much about it though, Myung and James walked over to where I was standing and Myung asked if I would like to review the game I mentioned earlier. Um&#8230; YES!!!! (And I should mention that being able to tether my iPad to my phone so I could download SGF files from the KGS Archives was a 1000% win!)<br />
For my first professionally reviewed game, the best way I can summarize it is to say that I was absolutely blown away. Myung&#8217;s review and insight into various aspects of the game were so eye opening and revealing. I wish there was a way for me to capture everything onto an SGF, but so much of what I was told involved conceptual gaps that I still haven&#8217;t quite come to terms with. When I do though, I promise that I will make it my first priority to write an article on it.<br />
As someone who has had his games reviewed a number of times, I had forgotten what it was like to have a game reviewed in person. It&#8217;s really a completely different atmosphere. Although much of the credit is due to Myung&#8217;s ability to teach and illustrate his points clearly, I do think that reviews flow much better in person. Not only can Myung use my facial expressions to determine whether or not I&#8217;m understanding something, a real board makes it very easy to switch out positions and show why one is better than another. Maybe it&#8217;s just me or the fact that Myung was reviewing my game, but the game review just felt extremely effective.<br />
Although the night was rather uneventful in the sense that I was the only person there, the time that I got to spend talking and learning with Myung and James was invaluable and has already made the convention incredibly worthwhile. Definitely looking forward to tonight!</p>
