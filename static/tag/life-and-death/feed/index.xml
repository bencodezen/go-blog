				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 style="text-align: center;">Introduction</h2>
<p>For this week&#8217;s meditation, we really get to see a very popular joseki choice (i.e., small knight dive after one space low approach to the star point) get demolished (globally). Though it is certainly still an option in certain fuseki, it has fallen out of favor with me and I don&#8217;t really see it as a viable move anymore in today&#8217;s metagame because it gives your opponent the opportunity to choose what&#8217;s best for him: (1) Take corner? (2) Take side? (3) Tenuki. Not a pleasant feeling at all&#8230;<br />
Aside from that though, this is a game that is full of fighting spirit from both sides with a constant push and pull to gain the initiative. And because this game is shorter than the typical game I normally feature, I would recommend that you take more time to solve the problems in the kifu. There are two in particular: (1) a ladder and (2) life and death. Hope you enjoy the review!<br />
Thanks to Zak for letting me use our game and helping out with figuring out some of the key variations. Looking forward to our next one!<br />

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 style="text-align: left;">Overview</h2>
<p>After trying to go through my training regimen from last week, I realized I was getting bored of practicing the same problems over and over again. And while my intentions were good (since my goal was to make all the problems instinctive), interest and motivation trumps that so I&#8217;ve moved on to more interesting topics to change it up for now. And especially after giving thought to the notion that <a title="WGW37: Tesuji More Useful Than Tsumego?" href="//wgw37-tesuji-more-useful-than-tsumego/">tesuji is more important than life and death</a>, I really wanted to start studying tesuji once again.<br />
On another note, in case anyone missed it, the <a title="Nova Go Club Tournaments Website" href="http://www.novagoclub.org/tournaments">Washington Open</a> is happening this weekend. Yours truly will be attending and competing/participating in whatever I can do. So you can definitely look forward to a series of posts on the event. I&#8217;m a little nervous because I haven&#8217;t really been playing as much as I should have, but I&#8217;ll have to brush that aside and just go to have as much fun as I can. If I can play really interesting games, then I will consider this event to be a success. See you all next week!<br />
PS. In case you didn&#8217;t know, fellow go player Risingstar just started his own <a title="RisingStar's Blog" href="http://gosimplycomplex.blogspot.com/">blog</a>, so be sure to check it out and support him as we try and bolster go&#8217;s presence online!</p>

[expand title=&#8221;Before I Read This Book&#8230;&#8221; trigclass=&#8221;expandTitle&#8221;]
As an enthusiast of the &#8220;Graded Go Problems for Beginners&#8221; series, I have to say that I was ecstatic when I heard about this series. After all, every kyu player dreams of making it to the big dan league and being able to solve &#8220;dan level&#8221; problems. And even though I got myself a copy of this book quite a while ago, this book seemed quite daunting to me for some time due to the fact that I just felt I wasn&#8217;t ready for &#8220;dan&#8221; problems. Anyhow, I&#8217;m glad I finally got around to reading it so that you can hear my thoughts on the book itself.<br />
[/expand]
[expand title=&#8221;My Review&#8221; trigclass=&#8221;expandTitle&#8221; expanded=&#8221;true&#8221;]
Perhaps my favorite aspect about the entire &#8220;Graded Go Problems&#8221; series as a whole is the extremely clean format. For those who don&#8217;t know what I&#8217;m talking about, every page that contains the problems is divided into four clean and even rectangles. Secondly, the numbering, diagram, directions, and even hints are all in universal places so that once you get exposed to the format, you&#8217;ll never wonder where to look next. And last but not least, the solutions are never exposed on the same page (aka you can&#8217;t see the solution as you&#8217;re trying to solve the problem). And thankfully, Graded Go Problems for Dan Players continues that tradition.<br />
One of the new things I noticed with this series is that they added an actual rank estimation for the problem difficulty. So a few examples of this might include: &#8220;Solve at a glance = 4-kyu, Solve within five minutes = 3-dan, etc.&#8221; While this is rather neat since you feel a sense of accomplishment if you&#8217;re able to solve it within the allotted time-frame, it&#8217;s important to realize that these rank estimations are a bit arbitrary. Just because you&#8217;re able to solve a few dan level problems at a glance does not necessarily mean you are &#8220;dan&#8221; level (whether it&#8217;s reading ability or playing ability). If you&#8217;re able to solve the whole book at a glance though, then it goes without saying you are way stronger than a dan player. xD<br />
When it comes to the solutions, they have a set standard format for how solutions are displayed and approached. In terms of basic format, every problem gets three solution diagrams. This generally includes the correct variation, an alternate variation / continuation of the correct variation, and an incorrect variation. In addition, there is usually at least a sentence to two explaining each of the variations in order to help the reader understand what&#8217;s going on.<br />
If there were to be any complaint about this series, it would probably be that the problems are not segmented into different techniques. However, I would remind the reader that the purpose of this series is to provide a collection of high-quality problems. As a result, the problems would be an assortment of different problems as opposed to a hierarchy of problems broken down by techniques. If you&#8217;re looking for problems categorized in such a fashion, you might benefit from checking out the Level Up Series along with Life and Death Problems 1 Basics by Robert Jasiek.<br />
Overall, I think that this series is destined for the same greatness as the &#8220;Graded for Go Problems for Beginners&#8221; when it comes to high quality problems that are displayed in an easy to read format. Definitely a must-have for any player serious about practicing their reading and looking for ways to keep honing their ability. Highly recommended!<br />

<strong>My Abilities</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A mid to high SDK (single digit kyu) kyu who has read his fair share of go books and has a pretty strong foundation in the basics and teaching go.</li>

<p><strong>My Perspective</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Starts training the reader to look for the key stones.</li>
<li>Trains the reader to look for weak points in shapes for life and death.</li>
<li>Exposes the reader to a number of joseki using knowledge that one should have gained from the previous volumes.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What did I gain from reading this book?</strong></p>

<li>Realization that I&#8217;m actually kind of slow when it comes to recognizing which stones are critical.</li>
<li>A better understanding of why certain joseki progress the way they do.</li>
<li>Improved baseline when it comes to reading basic life and death situations.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What style of teaching does the book use?</strong></p>

</li>
<li>Other Learning Mechanisms:
<ul>
<li>Cute and entertaining comics to teach and/or reinforce lessons.</li>
<li>Simple explantations that are accompanied by equally simple diagrams.</li>
<li>Samples of openings from professional games to further acclimate the reader to full games on a 19&#215;19 board.</li>

<p><strong>What aspect can be improved on?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>No complaints here!</li>

<strong>My Abilities</strong></p>

<li>I&#8217;ve studied my fair share of life and death and can confidently say that I have a SDK (single digit kyu) level of life and death.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>My Perspective</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>In general, I would say that I have always preferred learning through experience. Though in all honesty, after finishing the second volume, I was skeptical of how far I could really get in this book.</li>

[expand title=&#8221;My Review&#8221; trigclass=&#8221;expandTitle&#8221; expanded=&#8221;true&#8221;]
<strong>What did I enjoy about the book?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Though my inability to progress very far was slightly depressing, I was happy to see that there was still a lot of room for me to grow and improve my life and death skills.</li>
<li>The drill seargent routine is great because I have multiple opportunities to get exposure to moves I would have never considered before.</li>
<li>There is a huge focus on shapes that players don&#8217;t normally study: rectangular six and 2-2-2. In addition, these shapes are dissected to a very detailed level. Example: Rectangular six with one outside liberty versus two liberties.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What did I gain from reading this book?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A broader perspective on the different variations that can arise from life and death postiions.</li>
<li>A better grasp on techniques used to either kill or save a group.</li>
<li>Moderate improvement in my reading abilities. (This is only due to the speed at which I was going through problems. Anyone who diligently studies each problem to mastery will most likely gain a significant boost to their reading ability).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What style of teaching does the book use?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Curriculum Style
<ul>
<li>Content is organized into lessons, topics, or themes in order to facilitate learning.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Teaching Mechanism:
<ul>
<li>Practice problems</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What aspect can be improved on?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>I felt that the problems got a lot more difficult very quickly. However, this should be taken with a grain of salt since there is a good chance that the reader is supposed to already have a more solid reading ability than I have before working on this book.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Is this book easy to read?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Yes. Unless you can&#8217;t read English, it really doesn&#8217;t get any simpler.</li>

Compared to <a title="Book Review: 1001 Life and Death Problems" href="//book-review-1001-life-and-death-problems/">1001 Life and Death Problems</a>, this series does a better job hand-holing players new to life and death through the basic shapes and variations. On the other hand, I would say that in terms of polishing a player&#8217;s life and death skills, 1001 Life and Death Problems is still highly recommended. So to clarify, neither one trumps the other. Both can provide great value to a player&#8217;s life and death abilities.<br />

<li>You can expect the same quality of problems from the first volume.</li>
<li>A great way for players to drill their life and death skills.</li>
<li>Though I had a relatively easy time with the first volume, the problems in this book started to pose some difficulty for me.</li>

[expand title=&#8221;Before I Read This Book&#8230;&#8221; trigclass=&#8221;expandTitle&#8221;]
<strong>My Abilities</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>I&#8217;ve studied my fair share of life and death and can confidently say that I have a SDK (single digit kyu) level of life and death.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>My Perspective</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>After finishing the first volume, I was expecting this book to be rather easy to do as well.</li>

[expand title=&#8221;My Review&#8221; trigclass=&#8221;expandTitle&#8221; expanded=&#8221;true&#8221;]
<strong>What did I enjoy about the book?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>They have no reservation in terms of making you drill the same concept repeatedly.</li>
<li>There are so many concepts and shapes in this book that makes it very valuable.</li>
<li>The review sections (e.g., quizzes) and tests do a great job helping you determine if you actually learned the lessons prior.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What did I gain from reading this book?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A broader perspective on the different variations that can arise from life and death postiions.</li>
<li>A better grasp on techniques used to either kill or save a group.</li>
<li>The problems in this book actually posed some difficulty for me at times. Being that this is the second book, it didn&#8217;t take long for me to realize how weak my life and death skills really are.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What style of teaching does the book use?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Curriculum Style
<ul>
<li>Content is organized into lessons, topics, or themes in order to facilitate learning.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Teaching Mechanism:
<ul>
<li>Practice problems</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What aspect can be improved on?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>If I had to request one thing, it&#8217;s that I was hoping that the difficulty of the problems would be more gradual. The difficulty of the problems increased faster than I was expecting. Though this should be taken with a grain of salt since I have a feeling this is just an indicator of how weak my reading abilities are instead of it being the book&#8217;s problem.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Is this book easy to read?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Yes. Unless you can&#8217;t read English, it really doesn&#8217;t get any simpler.</li>

Compared to <a title="Book Review: 1001 Life and Death Problems" href="//book-review-1001-life-and-death-problems/">1001 Life and Death Problems</a>, this series does a better job hand-holing players new to life and death through the basic shapes and variations. On the other hand, I would say that in terms of polishing a player&#8217;s life and death skills, 1001 Life and Death Problems is still highly recommended. So to clarify, neither one trumps the other. Both can provide great value to a player&#8217;s life and death abilities.<br />

<strong>My Abilities</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Having worked through other life and death books, I am confident enough to say that I have a SDK (single digit kyu) understanding of life and death.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>My Perspective</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>I was looking forward to getting exposed to a lot of basic life and death shapes. In addition, I was hoping to get a bit of practice on the different shapes so I could be a lot more confident on my life and death abilities when I finished the book.</li>
</ul>
[/expand]
[expand title=&#8221;My Review&#8221; trigclass=&#8221;expandTitle&#8221; expanded=&#8221;true&#8221;]
<strong>What did I enjoy about the book?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>There are so many shapes that you get to learn about!</li>
<li>On top of that, these shapes are ones that actually occur quite frequently in games! Case and point, I actually ran into a J shape soon after I finished the book.</li>
<li>There are a lot of &#8220;what is the status of this group&#8221; problems.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What did I gain from reading this book?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Exposure to a lot of new shapes that I never even considered life and death shapes in the past.</li>
<li>Better understanding of the weaknesses in various shapes.</li>
<li>New ideas regarding how the opponent would/should actually respond in certain life and death scenarios.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What style of teaching does the book use?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Textbook Approach
<ul>
<li>Organized in a curriculum format that reflects the learning style one might normally find in school.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Primary Learning Mechanism:
<ul>
<li>Explanations with example diagrams</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Other Learning Mechanisms:
<ul>
<li>Practice problems</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What aspect can be improved on?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Though the fact that it uses &#8220;what is the status of this group&#8221; problems is a good thing for the most part, I feel that this is counter-productive to anyone learning life and death for the first time since status problems can actually be rather difficult for players who are not accustomed to reading multiple rather complex variations in life and death situations.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Is this book easy to read?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Yes. Davies&#8217; writing style is easy to understand and his conversational style makes for a fun read. In addition, almost every diagram is accompanied by a short line or paragraph explaining the position.</li>
</ul>

<a title="Book Review: 1001 Life and Death Problems" href="//book-review-1001-life-and-death-problems/">1001 Life and Death Problems</a> is much more appropriate for players looking for an introduction to life and go.

[expandsub1 title=&#8221;1001 Life and Death Problems&#8221; trigclass=&#8221;cBookTitle&#8221;]
Compared to <a title="Book Review: 1001 Life and Death Problems" href="//book-review-1001-life-and-death-problems/">1001 Life and Death Problems</a>, this series does a better job hand-holing players new to life and death through the basic shapes and variations. On the other hand, I would say that in terms of polishing a player&#8217;s life and death skills, <a title="Book Review: 1001 Life and Death Problems" href="//book-review-1001-life-and-death-problems/">1001 Life and Death Problems</a> is still highly recommended. So to clarify, neither one trumps the other. Both can provide great value to a player&#8217;s life and death abilities.<br />

[expandsub2 title=&#8221;Elementary Go Series, Volume 4 &#8211; Life and Death&#8221; trigclass=&#8221;cBookTitle&#8221;]
While <a title="Book Review: Life and Death" href="//book-review-life-and-death/">Life and Death</a> does a great job providing a broad survey of different shapes through explanations and accompanying practice problems, this series uses the &#8220;learn it through experience&#8221; methodology. Though they may overlap on a good deal of material, I believe that they complement one another and would both be of great use to serious players wanting to improve their life and death.<br />

<h3>Detailed Review</h3>
<h4>Readability &#8211; 8 / 10</h4>
<p>The directions for the problems don&#8217;t get any simpler. You have one of two directions: Black to kill or Black to live. This can be slightly confusing for those who wish for more specific directions whether life means seki or not; but this is more accurate to what players must do in their actual games. In addition, the explanation are on the shorter side in order to accommodate the large number of problems. Due to the lack of variations, the readability of the book is rather difficult since there will be times where you are unsure of why your answer is wrong. However, since players purchasing this book are aiming to master the basics and progress into intermediate and hard life and death problems, the format of the book is a great stepping stone for doing so.</p>
<h4>Content Quality &#8211; 10 / 10</h4>
<p>The content quality is primarily boosted by the way that the problems are categorized. You start with one move problems (to kill or live), and then work your way up to three move problems and then five move problems. As a result, each section is carefully designed to meet those requirements and allow players to get a much better grasp of life and death concepts before jumping to something more advanced. Very high marks for this categorization method.</p>
<h4>Final Thoughts</h4>
<p>This book is not for the faint-hearted. 1,001 problems is a lot more difficult than it seems and it can get tiring at times. However, I cannot stress enough how great this book is at giving players a really good structure for practicing and reinforcing basic life and death skills. It may not cover every life and death problem category that exists out there, but it focuses on the important ones that you will generally see at the beginner and intermediate level. In addition, it gives players great practice in increasing the number of moves they are able to see in their head. So if you&#8217;re looking to focus on life and death problems that provide a challenge that won&#8217;t bore you to death, this is the book for you.</p>
