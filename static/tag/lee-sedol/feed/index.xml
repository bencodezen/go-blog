For Game 5 of this epic <a title="Gu Li and Lee Sedol Jubango" href="//gu-li-lee-sedol-jubango/">jubango</a> between Lee Sedol (9P) and Gu Li (9P), we are at an exciting point in this match as the record stands at 2-2! So for this fifth game, this will serve as the tiebreaker for who takes the lead into the second half of the jubango!<br />
In case you don&#8217;t follow the professional scene, up to this point, Gu Li (9p) has been doing very well against Lee Sedol (9p) and was considered the favorite to win this match since he also won the last two jubango matches as well.<br />
With that said, buckle in for one of the most exciting games they&#8217;ve played to date! Hope you enjoy the review!<br />

<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Fun Trivia:</strong> This game was played in Shangri-La, Yunnan, China which is 10,000 ft above the sea! As a result, oxygen was rather thin and both players had to deal with having less oxygen than normal which may have affected their performance more than anticipated.</p>

For Game 4 of this epic <a title="Gu Li and Lee Sedol Jubango" href="//gu-li-lee-sedol-jubango/">jubango</a> between Lee Sedol (9P) and Gu Li (9P), with the current record being 2-1 in Lee Sedol&#8217;s favor, everyone sat in anticipation as they waited to see if Gu Li would be able to even up the record! With Gu Li&#8217;s record against Lee Sedol as of late though, many fans were certainly feeling that Gu Li had a great chance to win this game.<br />
I am happy to say that today&#8217;s review is forged from the combined efforts of myself and frozensoul (5d) once again! Though I didn&#8217;t make this explicitly clear before, please feel free to direct any questions to him on KGS or even leave a comment below for him and he&#8217;ll be sure to answer. Hope that you enjoy our game review and let us know if there&#8217;s anything we can do to improve it for you!<br />

For Game 3 of the epic <a title="Gu Li and Lee Sedol Jubango" href="//gu-li-lee-sedol-jubango/">jubango</a> between Lee Sedol (9P) and Gu Li (9P), we have arrived at a crucial point. Lee Sedol is already 2-0 (<a title="WGW 31: Gu Li vs Lee Sedol — Jubango Game 1 Amateur Review" href="//wgw-31-gu-li-vs-lee-sedol-jubango-game-1-amateur-review/">Game 1</a> and <a title="WGW 33: Gu Li vs Lee Sedol — Jubango Game 2 Amateur Review" href="//wgw-33-gu-li-vs-lee-sedol-jubango-game-2-amateur-review/">Game 2</a>) and there is concern that the jubango will end earlier than desired. After all, everyone wants to see all 10 games. However, the rules of the jubango is that the first to six victories win. As a result, for this game, even Lee Sedol fans were rooting for Gu Li to turn the tide so that we could see more games.<br />
For those who don&#8217;t keep up with the professional scene, Gu Li had managed to beat Lee Sedol in two other tournament matches prior to this game, so even though there was concern that there would be too much pressure on Gu Li, people had high hopes that Gu Li would be able to make a comeback this game.<br />
As with the previous reviews (<a title="WGW 31: Gu Li vs Lee Sedol — Jubango Game 1 Amateur Review" href="//wgw-31-gu-li-vs-lee-sedol-jubango-game-1-amateur-review/">Game 1</a> and <a title="WGW 33: Gu Li vs Lee Sedol — Jubango Game 2 Amateur Review" href="//wgw-33-gu-li-vs-lee-sedol-jubango-game-2-amateur-review/">Game 2</a>), this review continues to be geared towards kyu players who struggle with the advanced analysis and discussion that normally occurs between dan and professional level players. There is commentary for every move so that hopefully you won&#8217;t ever feel lost. In addition, I am happy to announce that frozensoul (5d) has joined forces with me again for this game review. Many thanks goes out to him for providing a number of the insights you&#8217;ll see throughout the review.<br />
Just like before, please let me know if you notice anything or have any suggestions that I can do to improve the review. I look forward to getting your feedback on this game review. Hope you enjoy it and learn a thing or two through it!<br />

As some of you know, Gu Li and Lee Sedol recently had their second game in their <a title="Gu Li and Lee Sedol Jubango" href="//gu-li-lee-sedol-jubango/">jubango</a>. And because the feedback on <a title="WGW 31: Gu Li vs Lee Sedol — Jubango Game 1 Amateur Review" href="//wgw-31-gu-li-vs-lee-sedol-jubango-game-1-amateur-review/">my review of Gu Li and Lee Sedol&#8217;s first jubango game</a> was positive, I am happy to announce that I will continue reviewing every game from this jubango! Before we get into the review itself though, there are a couple of things I wanted to mention.</p>
<ol>
<li>In response to your feedback from <a title="WGW 31: Gu Li vs Lee Sedol — Jubango Game 1 Amateur Review" href="//wgw-31-gu-li-vs-lee-sedol-jubango-game-1-amateur-review/">my review of Gu Li and Lee Sedol&#8217;s first jubango game</a>, this review was created to include more of my reactions and thoughts on the game as opposed to simply trying to &#8220;teach people what&#8217;s going on.&#8221;</li>
<li>However, I do want to emphasize that I still believe firmly in providing a thorough breakdown of the game in order to allow players of all strengths to be able to follow the game and gain more enjoyment from it. So continuing with the same format as before, there is commentary for every single move regardless of how &#8220;obvious&#8221; it might seem.</li>
<li>Though frozensoul and I were able to combine forces on the first game, I was unable to get together with him in time for me to release this post. So this game review is solely my doing and therefore all ideas and analyses come from the best I have in my SDK brain. Hopefully in the future I&#8217;ll be able to collaborate with him and/or other stronger players as well.</li>
<li><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">For more advanced reviews, be sure to keep an eye out on </span><a style="line-height: 1.5em;" title="World Go Online Review of Jubango Game 1" href="http://www.kiseido.com/printss/guliten1.html">World Go Online</a><span style="line-height: 1.5em;"> and </span><a style="line-height: 1.5em;" title="GoGameGuru Review of Jubango Game 2" href="http://gogameguru.com/lee-sedol-races-ahead-2-0-gu-li-vs-lee-sedol-jubango/">GoGameGuru</a><span style="line-height: 1.5em;"> since I&#8217;m sure they will have their own in the near future.</span></li>
</ol>
<p>I hope that you enjoy the review and improved format. Be sure to leave comments as the format is still a work in progress and I am always trying to make the reading experience a more enjoyable one for you!<a href="//wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Gu-Li-vs-Lee-Sedol-20140223.sgf"><br />

For those who didn&#8217;t know, Gu Li and Lee Sedol had their first epic match of their <a title="Gu Li and Lee Sedol Jubango" href="//gu-li-lee-sedol-jubango/">ten match series jubango</a>. And though many of you might have watched the game or checked out the game record later on, I wouldn&#8217;t be surprised if a number of weaker players like myself were left in bewilderment most of the time. After all, even though it was really exciting, it&#8217;s hard to learn from a game where so much is going on at once!<br />
So I came up with the idea to team up with my sensei, frozensoul, and do a review together in order to provide a step-by-step review of every move in the game. Now granted, I&#8217;m sure that many strong dan players might refute some of my comments or argue that there is so much more to what I reviewed, but my goal is simply this: <strong>To provide a game record that would allow kyu players to easily follow the game and understand some of the most significant moments of the game.</strong> As a result, it should be no surprise that complicated variations and advanced theoretical discussions are intentionally avoided and left to other people who are much more qualified to speak to those things than I am (i.e., <a title="World Go Online Review of Jubango Game 1" href="http://www.kiseido.com/printss/guliten1.html">World Go Online</a> and <a title="GoGameGuru Review of Jubango Game 1" href="http://gogameguru.com/go-commentary-lee-sedol-vs-gu-li-jubango-game-1/">GoGameGuru</a>). The following is the result of our efforts:<br />

<p style="text-align: left;">Finally, I would love to do this for every game in the jubango series. However, it took a LOT of time and effort in order to do so. As a result, I am hoping to get feedback from everyone on whether or not you think the review was helpful / was it worth it in order to help me decide whether to continue doing this or not. And as usual, if you like what I have done but have ideas for making it even better, please be sure to mention that in the comments below (or <a title="Contact" href="//contact/">email me</a> if you&#8217;re feeling shy =D). Looking forward to reading all of your comments!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After I got back from boxing last night, I was pretty much wiped out. The funny thing about me is that no matter how tired I am though, it seems that I somehow manage to find the energy and motivation to do something go related. So I decided to check out my first episode of a BadukTV English game review of Lee Changho 9P vs. Lee Sedol 9P.<br />
For those who aren&#8217;t aware of the popularity of go in the rest of the world, there are actual television channels that are ENTIRELY dedicated to go. Now, I don&#8217;t know about you, but I would love it if we had something equivalent here in the Western world. Unfortunately though, go has not yet risen to that level of popularity. On the upside though, pioneers like GoGamGuru and BadukTV have taken the first big step to bringing us one step closer to that dream.<br />
Here is the video that I watched last night:<br />
<iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='720' height='405' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/videoseries?list=PLq69jNwwOmf-Lkbyny1HwiRUKMg6uuFo2&#038;hl=en_US' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe>
Since I had never watched a TV episode dedicated entirely to go (excluding <em>Hikaru no Go</em>), I was a little nervous that I might get bored or that I would be unable to gain anything from it. Contrary to my fears however, I was pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoyed it. Though many complain about the co-host interrupting often and saying &#8220;Yes&#8221; all the time, you have to be conscious of the fact that the English is clearly not her first language and that chances are pretty good that her mannerisms derive from Korean culture. So with that in mind, I was able to look past it rather easily and just enjoy all the marvelous go.<br />
<em>For those who enjoyed the video above or would like to find out more about where you can watch more episodes like this, check out <a href="http://gogameguru.com/baduk-tv/">GoGameGuru&#8217;s BadukTV</a> to get access to more BadukTV that is accessible to English speakers!</em></p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Commented Games by Lee Sedol: Volume 1 &#8211; One Step Closer to the Summit</h2>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> Described as many as the Korean version of <em>Invincible</em>, this series contains some of the most detailed commentaries that I have read thus far. In addition, it is evident that Lee Sedol (9P) and Lee Sena have worked work to make the content accessible to both that beginner and intermediate players as well. This book not only goes into Lee Sedol&#8217;s thought on go strategy and his thoughts on the moves that occur; but also talks about his feelings and mental state during each game along with anecdotes from his journey to being one of the strongest go players in the world.<br />

[expand title=&#8221;Before I Read This Book&#8230;&#8221; trigclass=&#8221;expandTitle&#8221;]
When I first began my journey as a go player, I bought Invincible and was excited at the prospect of working through all the games of one of the greatest go legends of all time, Shusaku. Although I&#8217;m sure the quality of information in it is incredible, the experience of trying to work through it was rather traumatic since it was so incredibly advanced. Needless to say, I learned the hard way how incredibly inaccessible professional commentaries can be.<br />
Around the time this book came out, I had just started being exposed to the modern professional go scene. Like most people, I gravitated toward the most well known and strongest players (i.e., Lee Changho, Lee Sedol, Gu Li, etc.). So Lee Sedol&#8217;s book came out and it was being hailed as the Korean version of &#8220;Invincible,&#8221; I was a little nervous at first. When I found out however that it was written to try and be accessible to beginner/intermediate players as well, let&#8217;s just say I couldn&#8217;t purchase the book fast enough.<br />
[/expand]
[expand title=&#8221;My Review&#8221; trigclass=&#8221;expandTitle&#8221; expanded=&#8221;true&#8221;]
When I first started working through this book, one of the things that absolutely shocked me was how short the sequences were for each diagram. I was so used to other professional commentaries where game diagrams were often 10 moves or longer with such advanced discussions that this new approach was such a relief. In addition, since each game diagram is usually only a few moves long, the game discussion is broken down in far more detail and provides weaker players like myself an actual chance at learning something! In addition, at the end of each game, Lee Sedol highlights all of the important moments along with each game. This is something I had never encountered before and found it really helped me gain perspective on the game.<br />
And as if that weren&#8217;t enough already, the fact that every diagram is accompanied by Lee Sedol&#8217;s actual thoughts on the game along with intropsective thoughts on his mentality at the time makes the experience surreal. In fact, the only way I think that the game reviews could get any better would be if Lee Sedol himself were sitting with me one on one while going over his games and answering my questions. And yes, I&#8217;m being completely serious.<br />
In terms of my ability to understand the discussion about the variations however, I would have to say that there were times it was a bit difficult for me to follow. However, this is actually a really good thing since you will notice that I did not mention my eyes glazing over or anything. It&#8217;s just that it currently feels just slightly out of my reach, so I imagine that it won&#8217;t be too far in the future when I will be able to really appreciate all the discussion in the book.<br />
And finally, yes, it may take a long time before I&#8217;m able to fully comprehend the book in its entirety and apply it to my own games; but the fact is that I had an incredible time reading this book. The combination of learning about Lee Sedol&#8217;s perspective on go along with being able to get to know Lee Sedol as a person made the book an incredible experience. This will definitely be one of my favorites of all time and I am looking forward to revisiting it many times in my journey as a go player.<br />
[/expand]
[expand title=&#8221;Synopsis&#8221; trigclass=&#8221;expandTitle&#8221;]
<strong>What did I enjoy about the book?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>When you first open the book, you are immediately greeted by colored pictures capturing some of Lee Sedol&#8217;s highlights in life. While this might seem irrelevant to some, I found that it added a really personal touch to the book since it felt as if I was looking through a scrapbook and getting to know Lee Sedol personally.</li>
<li>The introductory page for each game was immensely appreciated since it gave context as to the kind of game being played along with how high the stakes were.</li>
<li>The game commentary is extremely detailed and you get to hear Lee Sedol&#8217;s personal thoughts on both the go discussion along with his mentality at the time.</li>
<li>The way Lee Sedol highlights the important moments of each game is new and really helped to wrap up the game in a very thorough manner.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What did I gain from reading this book?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A much broader perspective on the game in regards to how to approach it.</li>
<li>The realization of just how important accurate reading is when it comes to go.</li>
<li>A new awareness of how often things can change and that trade-offs can occur at any time in the game.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>How is the book structured?</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>A one page introduction to the game with the following information:
<ul>
<li>Prize Money (1st Place)</li>
<li>Winner&#8217;s Purse (2nd Place)</li>
<li>Tournament Regulations (Time Allotted for Each Game)</li>
<li>Short summary of the tournament&#8217;s background and general structure.</li>
<li>The tournament pairing chart.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A title page featuring:
<ul>
<li>A black and white picture from the actual game itself (with the respective players included).</li>
<li>The tournament and round that the game was played in.</li>
<li>The date that the game was played.</li>
<li>Indication of who played which color and what rank they were at the time.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>For the commentary portion of each chapter, each figure had the following structure:
<ol>
<li>A large kifu that made it easy to read and figure out where each move was.</li>
<li>Below each kifu was at least a few lines from Lee Sedol commenting on his mental state of mind or thoughts he was having at the time. This is not to be confused with go related commentary, since it is more of a psychological introspection than anything else.</li>
<li>Approximately a paragraph long of Lee Sedol&#8217;s explanation of what happened in the featured sequence and some of his thoughts on it (e.g., why he played the way he did, etc.).</li>
<li>As you can expect from any game review, the discussion of variations and numerous diagrams appear with each sequence.</li>
<li>At the end of each game, Lee Sedol goes through and summarizes the highlights of each game and discusses the importance of that moment.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>An epilogue of Lee Sedol&#8217;s thoughts of the tournament as a whole along with any thoughts he had about himself as a player and his psychological state at the time. In other words, it&#8217;s as if you got the opportunity to talk to Lee Sedol and hear his thoughts on the tournament. Extremely enjoyable to read.</li>
<li>Finally, spread throughout the chapters, players will also find anecdotes and random tidbits (called Episodes in the Table of Contents) about Lee Sedol that serve as an extremely enjoyable break.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>What aspect can be improved on?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>No complaints here!</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Is this book easy to read?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Yes. The tone of the book was primarily conversational that really helped alleviate any difficulty weaker players might normally have when reading a book with professional level commentary.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Bottom Line</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>The first book where a professional provides commentary that can be accessible by beginner and intermediate players (though a bit more towards intermediate players).</li>
<li>The format of the book makes for an incredible and unforgettable experience where the reader can be immersed in go and Lee Sedol&#8217;s thoughts while also getting to know him at the same time.</li>
<li>It takes professional level commentary to a level never seen before.</li>
<li>Worth every penny and more for the content and experience you get with it!</li>
</ol>

<ul>
<li>Any players who are fans of Lee Sedol.</li>

I don&#8217;t know if any of you have ever heard of the game &#8220;Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon&#8221; (which is a deviation from the theory &#8220;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six_degrees_of_separation">six degrees of separation</a>&#8220;), but it essentially boils down to the idea that every person is connected to another within six connections. And as you might guess based on the title of my post, I am writing because my friend Eric Lui had the honor of competing in the 2013 Samsung Cup and got to play against Lee Sedol!!!! I would be lying if I said I wasn&#8217;t jealous in the least, but that is still just plain epic!!!!!!<br />
Now of course, while this usually is worthy of a post all on its own, there is another reason I&#8217;m also writing about Lee Sedol. Prior to all of above, I injured my left hand from boxing and have had to take it a little easier as of late. Since I&#8217;m trying to rest in order to quickly recover, what better way to fill the time than to study some go? And guess who&#8217;s book I happened to decide to study. That&#8217;s right. <a title="GoGamGuru Commented Games by Lee Sedol Vol 1 Purchase Link" href="http://shop.gogameguru.com/commented-games-by-lee-sedol-1/?acc=e4da3b7fbbce2345d7772b0674a318d5">Commented Games by Lee Sedol Volume 1</a>!<br />
As I was working through it, I came upon an anecdote where his sister described how his father used to train him when it came to solving life and death. Lee Sedol&#8217;s father stressed accuracy and would scold him harshly whenever he solved a problem incorrectly. As a result, Lee Sedol would check his answer 100 times over before showing his father the answer regardless of how simple the problem might seem. Though seemingly harsh at the time, his sister believes that this is one of the reasons that Lee Sedol&#8217;s reading is as strong as it is today.<br />
So how does this relate to me? Well I am the first to admit that I am pretty lazy when it comes to solving problems. I might give a problem anywhere from a glance to 30 seconds (depending on my mood) before checking out the answer. I tried to tell myself that this is because I wanted more exposure to new sequences; but in reality, this has probably been hurting my reading more than helping it.<br />
And then as if I wasn&#8217;t already feeling guilty enough about my lazy approach to studying life and death, Lee Sedol makes the following statement:</p>
<blockquote><p>Fighting spirit without the base of thorough reading is nothing but recklessness that leads directly to defeat.</p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: left;"><a href="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2013/09/mindblown.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-3936 aligncenter" alt="mindblown" src="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2013/09/mindblown.jpg?resize=450%2C268" width="450" height="268" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>While I was blown away by how insightful that comment is, another part of me also felt incredibly sheepish as I realized that Lee Sedol had just summed up why I lose most of my games in one line. Heh&#8230; Perhaps it&#8217;s time to take a moment and rethink my approach to studying&#8230;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On Sunday, July 21st, I was able to finally join my friends at <a href="http://www.zhouyuan.com/">Yuan Zhou</a>&#8216;s Monthly Workshop! Though I was originally unable to go, I&#8217;m glad that I was able to make it out!<br />
The day began as always with a tsumego on the demonstration board.<br />
<figure id="attachment_3625" style="width: 122px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2013/07/tsumego.png"><img class=" wp-image-3625 " alt="tsumego problem" src="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2013/07/tsumego.png?resize=122%2C274" width="122" height="274" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Black to play. What is White&#8217;s status?</figcaption></figure>
Though I had the correct answer at one point, I talked myself out of it by misreading the order of moves. As a result, I unfortunately can&#8217;t proudly say I solved it with confidence. Haha. But in terms of what I gained from that experience, I need much more work on my life and death skills. I&#8217;m decent with some of the instinctual moves, but I need to be better in terms of being absolutely sure of my answer.<br />
After my friend Gurujeet answered the question correctly, we moved on to reviewing a professional game between Lee Sedol [9P] and Lian Xiao [4P] ([download label=&#8221;Download Kifu&#8221;]//wp-content/uploads/2013/07/LianLee07212013.sgf[/download]). It was an exciting game that really helped to open my eyes. Some of the major things I learned from the flow and tenacity of the players include:<br />
<span id="more-3614"></span></p>
<ol>
<li><span style="line-height: 13px;">Do not give your opponent an easy time when it comes to figuring out the next move.</span></li>
<li>The strength of a player is actually reflected in his/her ability to handle the center of the board.</li>
<li>When making a move, try to make the follow-up move as severe as possible.</li>
<li>If it&#8217;s not life or death, don&#8217;t fight on your opponent&#8217;s terms.</li>
<li>Always look for a more active way to defend yourself.</li>
</ol>
<p>Afterwards, we had lunch and then got our afternoon matches. Apparently according to AGA, my rating is actually -4.375 now (i.e. 4 kyu), so I got matched up with a fellow UMBC go player by the name of Nathan. We had played against one another at the local club before, but this would be our first ranked match against one another. Below is a record of our game along with some of Yuan Zhou&#8217;s and my thoughts as well.<a href="//wp-content/uploads/2013/07/2013.07.21-Yuan-Zhou-Workshop-Game.sgf"><br />

<p>In hindsight, I am really out of practice when it comes to playing with a clock. I got into byoyomi pretty early but somehow misread the clock as 3 minutes and 30 seconds when it fact it was actually 3 periods of 30 seconds. And to be honest, I didn&#8217;t even realize how little time until I heard the clock voice go, &#8220;1, 2, 3..&#8221; Then it suddenly occurred to me that I was about to lose on time and from that point on when playing in sudden death. Haha.<br />
The funny thing is that I wasn&#8217;t the only one with clock problems. Nathan told me after the game that he misread the clock as well (although he didn&#8217;t get into sudden death the way I did xD). And on top of that, my friends Gurujeet and Diego were so intent on their game that Black ended up losing on time due to some confusion. Haha. Fortunately we are all friends and the environment is a friendly-competitive one, so it was something we could all laugh about afterwards.<br />
My biggest highlight of the day would have to be when Yuan Zhou said &#8220;This may be a local loss, but this keeps with whole board thinking.&#8221; WOOT! One step toward eliminating kyu tunnel vision forever!<br />
At the end of the day however, it was a day full of learning and lots of fun. Big shoutout to Nate, Diego, Gurujeet, and Nathan for making it a blast!</p>
