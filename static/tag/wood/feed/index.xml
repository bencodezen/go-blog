[expand title=&#8221;Synopsis&#8221; trigclass=&#8221;expandTitle&#8221;]
<strong>What&#8217;s the best aspect about this product?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Light-weight and super affordable!</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What is the weakest aspect of this product?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Upon close inspection, the lines are not as clean as you&#8217;ll see on more expensive boards; but it still does the job well!</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Is it durable?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>After handling it, I see no reason why it won&#8217;t hold up to normal usage. However, if somewhere were to try and karate chop this board, I&#8217;m pretty sure it&#8217;d break. xD</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Bottom Line</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>A great go board for someone on a budget!</li>
<li>And in the event you know how to play Chinese chess, there&#8217;s a board of that on the back as well!</li>
<li>Definitely recommended over paper and/or plastic boards that exist out there!</li>
</ol>

[expand title=&#8221;My Review&#8221; trigclass=&#8221;expandTitle&#8221; expanded=&#8221;true&#8221;]
Here&#8217;s the front of the board at a slanted angle. It&#8217;s a nice yellow color to give it a semi-shin-kaya feel. (I prefer the yellow color over brown since it shows more contrast when stones are placed on the board; but that&#8217;s just a personal preference.)</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/01/dirtcheapgoboard02.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-4544" alt="dirtcheapgoboard02" src="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/01/dirtcheapgoboard02.jpg?resize=360%2C270" width="360" height="270" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">And here below, you can see that there&#8217;s a Chinese chess board on the back!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/01/dirtcheapgoboard03.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-4545" alt="dirtcheapgoboard03" src="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/01/dirtcheapgoboard03.jpg?resize=360%2C270" width="360" height="270" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Upon closer inspection, you&#8217;ll see that the lines are not perfectly straight the way you&#8217;ll see on higher quality boards. However, I wouldn&#8217;t let this be a deterrent from purchasing the board if it&#8217;s being used for casual play.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/01/dirtcheapgoboard04.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-4546" alt="dirtcheapgoboard04" src="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/01/dirtcheapgoboard04.jpg?resize=360%2C270" width="360" height="270" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Here are a couple of shots with the board in action with my size 36 glass stones. As you can see, the lines are not so obvious from a player&#8217;s perspective.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/01/dirtcheapgoboard05.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-4547" alt="dirtcheapgoboard05" src="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/01/dirtcheapgoboard05.jpg?resize=360%2C270" width="360" height="270" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/01/dirtcheapgoboard06.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-4548" alt="dirtcheapgoboard06" src="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/01/dirtcheapgoboard06.jpg?resize=360%2C270" width="360" height="270" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/01/dirtcheapgoboard07.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-4549" alt="dirtcheapgoboard07" src="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/01/dirtcheapgoboard07.jpg?resize=360%2C270" width="360" height="270" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Bottom line: I highly recommend this board for people who are looking to purchase boards for their club or for tournaments. This board would also function well as a casual study/playing board. However, I would definitely not recommend this as a primary goban for anyone who is looking for that classic air and sound you get from true wooden boards. So remember, the key thing to remember is that this is a board that focuses on affordability and practicality.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Folding Wooden Go Board</h2>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Over­all Rat­ing: 8 / 10 Ponnuki</h2>
<h3>High­lights</h3>
<ul>
<li>Great portable board considering I got it for around $10.</li>
<li>The lines are not drawn the best, but it does the job and is worth the purchase.</li>
<li>Let me know if you find this anywhere online, since the local store doesn&#8217;t sell it anymore.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Prod­uct Details</h3>
<ul>
<li>One folding Go Board (19&#215;19).</li>
<li>Measures 18-1/4&#8243;L x 17&#8243;W x 3-3/4&#8243;H (46.5cm x 43cm x 9.7cm).</li>
<li>Board is 1-1/2&#8243; (4cm) thick.</li>
</ul>
<p><span id="more-76"></span></p>
<h3>Detailed Review</h3>
<p><strong>Size &amp; Weight:</strong> For it&#8217;s portability, the size actually is quite nice since it fits in my 14 inch laptop messenger bag. It&#8217;s light compared to any other table board you might buy.<br />
<strong>Dura­bil­ity:</strong> It holds up very well and very reliable in transit. I&#8217;ve carried it a number of times and never worried about dings or scratches that might ruin the board.<br />
<strong>Usabil­ity:</strong> The sound that the board makes from stones hitting it are not nearly as fulfilling as one might get from a shin-kaya board, but it really fits the bill when you&#8217;re looking for an easy to transport go board.<br />
Although the local store does not sell it anymore, this product is definitely worth buying if you ever see one. In fact, the moment anyone finds a place that sells it, be sure to let me know!</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;"> Kitani Style Jujube Bowls</h2>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Overall Rating: 10 / 10 Ponnuki</h2>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">Highlights</h3>
<ul>
<li><span style="line-height: 13px;">This is my favorite style of bowls for holding go stones since they remind me of the ones on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hikaru_no_Go">Hikaru No Go</a>.</span></li>
<li>They have a nice finish to them that makes them very beautiful to look at.</li>
<li>Since the lid is also made of wood without any rubber coating, do not expect the lid to stay securely shut in the event the bowls tip over.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Product Details</h3>
<ul>
<li>Two Kitani style jujube wood Yunzi stone holders that measure 5&#8243; W x 4&#8243; H (12.7cm x 10cm)</li>
</ul>
<p><span id="more-2358"></span></p>
<h3>Detailed Review</h3>
<p>These bowls are from the Shin-Kaya Go Board Set. They come with a small square of yellow silk-like material that I believe is to cushion the bottom of the bowl for when you put your stones inside. Although it&#8217;s a rather small accessory, I think it adds a nice finishing touch to the bowls.<br />
<strong>Size &amp; Weight:</strong> The bowls on their own are rather light and can be held using one hand with relative ease.<br />
<strong>Durability:</strong> In the two years that I&#8217;ve owned these bowls, it has proven to be extremely durable and does not scratch very easily. Although I&#8217;m not expert on wood, they feel like high quality wood that will last for a very long time.<br />
<strong>Usability:</strong> Since the entire bowl is made of wood, the only caveat is that the lids do not stay on securely. So if the bowls get tipped upside down during transit, you can definitely expect the lid to slide off and stones to come out. Otherwise, the bowls function as you expect and look fantastic.<br />
Now of course, the opinion as to which style of bowl looks better is entirely subjective and varies between each person; but if you&#8217;re looking for kitani bowls made with quality wood, look no further.</p>
