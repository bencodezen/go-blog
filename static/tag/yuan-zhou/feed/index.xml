[expand title=&#8221;Before I Read This Book&#8230;&#8221; trigclass=&#8221;expandTitle&#8221;]
When I first started playing go, I was not too keen on learning about professional go at the time. Yet there were two names that I already knew that were legendary: Shusaku and Go Seigen. Being the crazy person I am, I went ahead and acquired Go Seigen&#8217;s entire game collection (in Chinese). Needless to say it was a reckless decision and I did not even open it up for quite some time.<br />
Some time later on, I was excited to hear that Yuan Zhou had released a book on Go Seigen&#8217;s style. Seeing as how this book would be in English and I might actually be able to comprehend it, I went ahead and purchased it in hopes that I might finally be able to make use of the collection I bought years ago.<br />
[/expand]
[expand title=&#8221;My Review&#8221; trigclass=&#8221;expandTitle&#8221; expanded=&#8221;true&#8221;]
When you first open the book, you are greeted with a fun little dialogue between Yuan Zhou and two amateur players (4 kyu and 1 dan respectively). In this conversation, Zhou inquires about what amateur players know about Go Seigen. After getting a basic gist of what they know, Zhou launches into a wonderful story-telling of Go Seigen biography and why he has become the legend he is known to be today. It is very entertaining and really helps to give context to a man that many speak so highly of. I personally feel that without this section, the book would not be complete.<br />
Now, in regards to the game commentaries, Zhou does a wonderful job of keeping the length of the diagrams to a minimum. It is usually easy to follow what Zhou is trying to illustrate. In addition, there are not too many variations to deter from the actual game. The goal of these commentaries serve more as an explanation of Go Seigen&#8217;s brilliance, as opposed to an in-depth discussion about go theory and technique, which really makes the book that much more enjoyable since professional go can often be difficult for amateurs to understand.<br />
As my first exposure to Yuan Zhou&#8217;s Master Play Series, I was very pleased with his ability to fit so much information in such a short book. I am looking forward to checking out the other ones in the future!<br />

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On Sunday, July 21st, I was able to finally join my friends at <a href="http://www.zhouyuan.com/">Yuan Zhou</a>&#8216;s Monthly Workshop! Though I was originally unable to go, I&#8217;m glad that I was able to make it out!<br />
The day began as always with a tsumego on the demonstration board.<br />
<figure id="attachment_3625" style="width: 122px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2013/07/tsumego.png"><img class=" wp-image-3625 " alt="tsumego problem" src="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2013/07/tsumego.png?resize=122%2C274" width="122" height="274" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Black to play. What is White&#8217;s status?</figcaption></figure>
Though I had the correct answer at one point, I talked myself out of it by misreading the order of moves. As a result, I unfortunately can&#8217;t proudly say I solved it with confidence. Haha. But in terms of what I gained from that experience, I need much more work on my life and death skills. I&#8217;m decent with some of the instinctual moves, but I need to be better in terms of being absolutely sure of my answer.<br />
After my friend Gurujeet answered the question correctly, we moved on to reviewing a professional game between Lee Sedol [9P] and Lian Xiao [4P] ([download label=&#8221;Download Kifu&#8221;]//wp-content/uploads/2013/07/LianLee07212013.sgf[/download]). It was an exciting game that really helped to open my eyes. Some of the major things I learned from the flow and tenacity of the players include:<br />
<span id="more-3614"></span></p>
<ol>
<li><span style="line-height: 13px;">Do not give your opponent an easy time when it comes to figuring out the next move.</span></li>
<li>The strength of a player is actually reflected in his/her ability to handle the center of the board.</li>
<li>When making a move, try to make the follow-up move as severe as possible.</li>
<li>If it&#8217;s not life or death, don&#8217;t fight on your opponent&#8217;s terms.</li>
<li>Always look for a more active way to defend yourself.</li>
</ol>
<p>Afterwards, we had lunch and then got our afternoon matches. Apparently according to AGA, my rating is actually -4.375 now (i.e. 4 kyu), so I got matched up with a fellow UMBC go player by the name of Nathan. We had played against one another at the local club before, but this would be our first ranked match against one another. Below is a record of our game along with some of Yuan Zhou&#8217;s and my thoughts as well.<a href="//wp-content/uploads/2013/07/2013.07.21-Yuan-Zhou-Workshop-Game.sgf"><br />

<p>In hindsight, I am really out of practice when it comes to playing with a clock. I got into byoyomi pretty early but somehow misread the clock as 3 minutes and 30 seconds when it fact it was actually 3 periods of 30 seconds. And to be honest, I didn&#8217;t even realize how little time until I heard the clock voice go, &#8220;1, 2, 3..&#8221; Then it suddenly occurred to me that I was about to lose on time and from that point on when playing in sudden death. Haha.<br />
The funny thing is that I wasn&#8217;t the only one with clock problems. Nathan told me after the game that he misread the clock as well (although he didn&#8217;t get into sudden death the way I did xD). And on top of that, my friends Gurujeet and Diego were so intent on their game that Black ended up losing on time due to some confusion. Haha. Fortunately we are all friends and the environment is a friendly-competitive one, so it was something we could all laugh about afterwards.<br />
My biggest highlight of the day would have to be when Yuan Zhou said &#8220;This may be a local loss, but this keeps with whole board thinking.&#8221; WOOT! One step toward eliminating kyu tunnel vision forever!<br />
At the end of the day however, it was a day full of learning and lots of fun. Big shoutout to Nate, Diego, Gurujeet, and Nathan for making it a blast!</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Overall Rating: 8 / 10 Ponnuki</h2>
<h3>Basic Information</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Title:</strong> The Chinese Opening</li>
<li><strong>Author: </strong>Yuan Zhou</li>
<li><strong>Publisher: </strong>Slate &amp; Shell</li>
<li><strong>Publication Date: </strong>2013</li>
<li><strong><strong>Page Length:</strong> </strong>184 pages</li>
</ul>
<h3>Synopsis</h3>
<ul>
<li>A great introductory book to the Chinese Opening.</li>
<li>Explanations are kept at a high level and thus allows for easy reading.</li>
<li>Appropriate for 10 kyu and stronger.</li>
<li>Recommended for serious players.</li>
</ul>
<p><span id="more-2875"></span></p>
<h3>What I Expected</h3>
<ul>
<li><span style="line-height: 13px;">An overview of the Chinese Opening that is easy to read and understand as long as there is some basic understanding of the opening.</span></li>
<li>Explanations of common approaches/responses to various responses to the Chinese Opening.</li>
</ul>
<h3>What You Can Expect</h3>
<ul>
<li>A nice and concise introduction to how the Chinese Opening grew to the popularity it receives today.</li>
<li>A clear and concise explanation as to why the high Chinese Opening fell out of popularity.</li>
<li>A good explanation for the ideal development and direction fro the Chinese Opening.</li>
<li>A [reprinted] article from Go Seigen on the Chinese Opening!</li>
<li>Over ten kifus for players to play through (although only parts of each game are utilized for commentary in the book while the rest is simply a kifu).</li>
</ul>
<h3>My Thoughts as 5 Kyu</h3>
<p>As someone who has studied the Chinese Opening rather extensively (at least from an amateur perspective), <span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Chinese Opening</span> by Yuan Zhou is a fantastic introduction to the fuseki.<br />
When purchasing this book, the key thing to understand is that this is an <em>introductory</em> book on the Chinese Opening. It&#8217;s main purpose is to introduce big concepts regarding the Chinese Opening in order to give players a broad understanding of how they should approach it. In addition, Zhou does an excellent job  illustrating how the Chinese Opening can be used by various styles of play: attacking, territorial, etc.<br />
Some of the areas it does not go extensively into include topics such as: how to respond when the opponent interrupts the Chinese Opening, different josekis and the reason for why one is better than another when considering the Chinese Opening, etc.<br />
Now of course, there is the question as to whether someone should simply purchase <a title="Book Review: The Chinese Opening (Kato)" href="//book-review-the-chinese-opening-kato/">Kato&#8217;s book</a> on the Chinese Opening instead.<br />
To put it simply, if your goal is to devote yourself solely to the Chinese Opening so that you can master it and use it to your heart&#8217;s content, then I would recommend going straight to <a title="Book Review: The Chinese Opening (Kato)" href="//book-review-the-chinese-opening-kato/">Kato&#8217;s book</a>. On the other hand, if your goal is to simply gain a better understanding of the Chinese Opening so you can counter it more effectively or use it occasionally in your games, then Zhou&#8217;s book is the one for you.</p>
<h3>Table of Content</h3>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Yesterday, I had the pleasure of attending another one of <a title="Yuan Zhou's Website" href="http://www.zhouyuan.com/">Yuan Zhou</a>&#8216;s Monthly Workshops!<br />
We started off with a life and death problem that is called &#8220;hunting the 6 stone bird.&#8221; Apparently it&#8217;s a very old problem that has been around for a long time, for those wondering what the shape looks like. For those who would like to try it out for themselves, here it is below:<br />
<figure id="attachment_1663" style="width: 250px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2013/01/6stonebird.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-1663" alt="6stonebird" src="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2013/01/6stonebird.png?resize=250%2C250" width="250" height="250" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Black to play.</figcaption></figure>
Afterwards, I got to hear a very captivating  review for one of <a title="Lee Chang Ho's Page" href="http://senseis.xmp.net/?YiChangHo">Lee Changho</a> 9p Vs. <a title="Park Jung Hwan's Page" href="http://senseis.xmp.net/?ParkJungHwan">Park Junghwan</a> 9p games in the most recent Ing Cup World Go Championship. It was one that was full of full of suspense, excitement, and a capturing battle on epic proportions that made Park Junghwan the decisive victor.<br />
As I listened to Yuan Zhou review the game, there were a few things that really struck me:<br />
<span id="more-1650"></span></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Professionals pay particular attention to their weak groups</strong>. They almost never let a weak group go unattended for more than a move or two.</li>
<li><strong>Professionals never play follow the leader.</strong> They try to figure out what their opponent is trying to do, and then usually come up with a move to interrupt the flow of their opponent&#8217;s game.</li>
<li><strong>Professional games tend to steer away from killing groups.</strong> The reasons lies in the fact that it is very difficult to kill a group and you usually end up sacrificing a lot of points in the process of attempting to do so.</li>
</ol>
<p>In addition, one of the biggest takeaways I had from the entire workshop is <strong>how incredibly important life and death is</strong>. I mean, sure, we all know that life and death is &#8220;important,&#8221; but I think that most players brush it off as a tedious chore that gets in the way of their game. And while I will be sure to write an article further detailing my new found appreciation for life and death, I leave you with this thought: Imagine the possibilities if you could live wherever you invaded/reduced. Wouldn&#8217;t every game become far more simpler?<br />
After the review, we had lunch and played a game with one another. As I looked back on my game, I believe that the reverse komi (-7.5 points) caused my opponent to take more risks than he needed to. In addition, our ranks are most likely about equal, so I believe that the game was rather lopsided to begin with. With that in mind, I do think that my play overall was rather poor and still shows a lack of my attention to the fundamentals of strong players.<br />

After many months of almost going and then not being able to, I am happy to report that I finally made it out to one of <a title="Yuan Zhou Website" href="http://zhouyuan.com/">Yuan Zhou</a>&#8216;s monthly workshops. This post is slightly overdue since I went to the November one; but it comes at a right time since the December workshop is right around the corner!<br />
For those who have never been to a go workshop, here&#8217;s a high level overview of what you might find:</p>
<ul>
<li>In depth review of a game (usually a professional one)</li>
<li>One round of games (with a main time around 45 minutes)</li>
<li>Game reviews for the games that were just played</li>
</ul>
<p>As I arrived at Yuan Zhou&#8217;s house, I nostalgically recalled the two lessons that I had taken with him in the past. They seemed so long ago, but I was glad that I was finally back to seriously study the game. As I walked towards the entrance, I felt a little apprehensive as I wondered whether I would be able to gain anything from this workshop since I am so weak; but before I could have any serious doubts, I was greeted by Yuan Zhou and welcomed inside.<br />
I was happy to see that Nate had already arrived, and promptly sat myself next to him as I was told to work on the life and death problem on the board. As we sat there staring at the board, Nate made a comment that made me laugh,</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Two years after Shifu told me someone named Ben might be coming who was close to my level, you&#8217;ve finally managed to show up.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>After everyone had arrived, it was time to see if the students had figured it out. As luck would have it, since I was the weakest player there, I was to give the first response. Recently, I had been exposed to some of the quirkier life and death problems that required atypical moves just as making the empty triangle descent and such; so I ended up choosing that move even though I couldn&#8217;t quite see the end of the sequence. Sure enough. I was wrong. Haha. Eventually a stronger player gave the right answer, and so we finished up the explanation and moved on to the review of the professional game.<br />
The game we were reviewing was one of <a title="Ishida Yoshio Wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoshio_Ishida">Ishida Yoshio</a> and <a title="Rin Kaiho Wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rin_Kaiho">Rin Kaiho</a>&#8216;s games from 1974. Before we even began looking at the kifu however, Yuan Zhou launched into a fascinating explanation of the history behind the game: <a title="Go Seigen Wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_Seigen">Go Seigen</a> &amp; <a title="Kitani Minoru Wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kitani_Minoru">Kitani Minoru</a>, the Super Six, the terse feelings of having a non-Japanese player hold both <a title="Meijin Wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meijin">Meijin</a> and <a title="Honinbo Wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honinbo">Honinbo</a> titles, and so on. While some may wonder how relevant this is to getting better, it is like a cultural tour of this game we all devote so much time to that many often overlook. And if you still aren&#8217;t convinced, knowing the history behind the entire game made for a much more exciting review since you have an understanding of the players and how high the stakes are.<br />
After the exciting game review, we had lunch and then proceeded with the afternoon game. Since we had an odd number of players, one of the players recorded my game while I had the opportunity to play. I felt kind of badly that I was playing and the player had to record, so in the future, I think that I would not mind being the recorder instead so other players can play instead. Anyhow, here&#8217;s the game record from that afternoon.<br />

<p>After all the games were finished, Yuan Zhou reviewed all of the games. If there&#8217;s something I learned from that experience, you tend to remember your lessons a lot better when other people are watching the review and seeing the mistakes you made. For example, the one thing that I will remember forever is the Elephant&#8217;s Eye (which I&#8217;ll write more on at another time). In addition, being able to have both sides of the game reviewed really helps to open you eyes as to what was supposed to work and what wasn&#8217;t supposed to work. On top of that, getting to see the game reviews for everyone else&#8217;s game was also very helpful.<br />
Although I started out skeptical of what I would gain from the workshop, I am now a huge fan of them. Since most of players will never have the opportunity to be an insei and study go at that level of intensity, I really feel that go workshops are like one day insei experiences. Everyone who attends is committing their time and money, and you can be sure that everyone wants to make the most out of it. In addition, they are spaced out in such a way that you don&#8217;t have to worry about information overload. In fact, that&#8217;s exactly what you want since the time apart from each workshop allows you to absorb and apply the things that you learned so that you will have new things to learn the next time around.<br />
I highly recommend Yuan Zhou&#8217;s workshops if you ever have the opportunity. The next workshop will be December 16th, 2012. If you&#8217;re interested in attending one of Yuan Zhou&#8217;s monthly workshops, contact him at <a href="mailto:yuan.zhou@zhouyuan.com">yuan.zhou@zhouyuan.com</a>. Hope to see you there one day!</p>

So I had my second private lesson today, and I have to say I felt like such an idiot as we were going over my games. It&#8217;s funny how blatantly obvious my idiotic decisions and rationales are when pointed out. I&#8217;m still falling into the typical traps of a new player (e.g. focusing on local areas, having no purpose, wishful thinking, etc.) Argh&#8230;. I think I&#8217;m going to have to come up with a handout for beginning Go players to look over once a day to help them out.<br />
One of the most critical aha moments that went off in my head today is the fact that I don&#8217;t and can&#8217;t quite read ahead worth crap. It&#8217;s definitely one of the reasons that I make the poor plays that I do. This is probably one of the reasons I hate half of the books that I&#8217;ve reviewed so far. They have so many complicated diagrams, but in reality there is probably more substance since they are probably assuming you can read it out in your head no problem. So far, I&#8217;ve been actually replaying variations on an actual board. This is useful to an extent, but I have to be able to play the simulations out in my head.<br />
As I mentioned at the beginning of this month, I&#8217;m trying to break the double digit kyu (DDK) by October 8th. It probably is near impossible to do so, but here&#8217;s my crazy game plan:</p>
<ol>
<li>Finish the following books:
<ul>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Opening Theory Made Easy</span> by Otake Hideo 9 dan</li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Whole Board Thinking in Joseki &#8211; Volume One</span> by Yi-Lun Yang</li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">One Thousand and One Life-and-Death Problems</span> by Richard Bozulich</li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Understanding Dan Level Play</span> by Yuan Zhou</li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Tesuji</span> by James Davies</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Replay 25 moves of a professional game (that has commentary) everyday.</li>
<li>Play one serious game (not a bot) everyday where I don&#8217;t rush and try my hardest.</li>
</ol>
<p>It&#8217;s like my teacher said, &#8220;It&#8217;s not hard to rise levels at the stage you&#8217;re at, you just have to stop doing all these irrational and inefficient moves.&#8221; Time to topple over these obstacles.
