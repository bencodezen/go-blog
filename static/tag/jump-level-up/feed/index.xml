[expand title=&#8221;Before I Read This Book&#8230;&#8221; trigclass=&#8221;expandTitle&#8221;]
As a mid to high SDK (i.e., single digit kyu) player, I was expecting to see the same quality of content from previous volumes. In addition, I was hoping that I would be able to solve most problems with relative ease while finding some problems challenging.<br />
[/expand]
[expand title=&#8221;My Review&#8221; trigclass=&#8221;expandTitle&#8221; expanded=&#8221;true&#8221;]
Once again, Lee Jae-Hwan has managed to sweep me off my feet when it comes to providing incredible content that really got my brain working. There were countless sections in here that I always knew about but really appreciated getting a chance to truly practice. Examples include: Identifying Seki, The Loose Connection, The Stone Pagoda, Hane Twice to Gain a Liberty, etc.<br />
Overall, I felt that the problems definitely started to increase in difficulty. While some problems are still very easy to solve and have very obvious solutions, there were numerous times where I had to really start looking at variations before concluding what my answer was going to be. I really appreciated this gradual increase in difficulty.<br />
Finally, some of you will notice that my &#8220;Things to Improve&#8221; section has become more of an Errata section (i.e., errors that I found). Although I still love the book and the series as a whole, there were a few more errors than I would have liked to have seen and some sections that weren&#8217;t as clear as they could have been (i.e., Cut On the Opposite Side).<br />
Nonetheless, this is still a wonderful addition to the series, and I&#8217;m looking forward to the next one!<br />
[/expand]
[expand title=&#8221;Synopsis&#8221; trigclass=&#8221;expandTitle&#8221;]
<strong>What did I enjoy about the book?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A very nice emphasis on evaluating seki positions.</li>
<li>Has the reader practice &#8220;fake nets.&#8221;</li>
<li>Does not hesitate to bring back basics like reading the ladder.</li>
<li>Really trains a lot of skills players often overlook like identifying vital points, hane twice to gain a liberty, and loose ladders.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What did I gain from reading this book?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>More comfortable with my ability to recognize seki positions.</li>
<li>Increased familiarity with various nets and reading out whether they work or not.</li>
<li>Increased confidence in reading out variations of basic life and death sequences.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What is the format of the book?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The book is primarily structured as follows:
<ul>
<li>(1) A one page explanation of the topic that you are about to practice. Example: When behind in liberties. They not only show the sequence for the proper technique, but also include common mistakes and brief explanations as to why they are mistakes.</li>
<li>(2) A set of very easy to understand and follow practice problems to ensure you understand what you are learning.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What aspect can be improved on?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Page 65 (#11) &#8211; Not a great example of bamboo vital point.</li>
<li>Page 66 (#5) &#8211; Answer is not the actual weakpoint. The 4-1 point is the weak point.</li>
<li>Page 69 (#4) &#8211; No solution available. Answer is the 4-1 point.</li>
<li>Page 94 Solutions &#8211; Label misprint. Skipped #10.</li>
<li>Page 122 (#12), Page 123 (#18), and Page 128 (#18) are identical problems.</li>
<li>Page 127 (#12) &#8211; In the wrong section. Different problem than expected. A save black problem in a kill white section.</li>
<li>Page 128 (#18) &#8211; In the wrong section. A kill white problem in a Save black section.</li>
<li>Page 143 (#22) &#8211; Again. Seems out of place. Problem&#8217;s solution is to maximize Black&#8217;s profit and not reduce White&#8217;s.</li>
<li>Page 148 (#3 Solution) &#8211; Wrong diagram. The answer should be the solid connection at 4-2 point. The tiger&#8217;s mouth at 4-1 works as well but leaves a ko threat of an atari at 3-2 and is therefore inferior to the solid connection.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Is this book easy to read?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Yes. Other than a few odd grammatical structures, it doesn&#8217;t get much more simple or straightforward than this.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Bottom Line</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Continues to live up to the quality of content you come to expect from this series.</li>
<li>Completely worth your time and money!</li>
</ol>
[/expand]
[expand title=&#8221;Recommended For&#8230;&#8221; trigclass=&#8221;expandTitle&#8221;]
<ul>
<li>Though the series is designed for kids, both kids and adults alike will be able to learn everything they need to know about playing go in a fun and entertaining way.</li>
<li>People who enjoy learning things in an easy to understand format and lots of opportunities to reinforce what they are learning.</li>

[expand title=&#8221;Before I Read This Book&#8230;&#8221; trigclass=&#8221;expandTitle&#8221;]
As a mid to high SDK (i.e., single digit kyu) player, I was expecting to see the same quality of content from previous volumes. In addition, I was hoping that I would be able to solve most problems with relative ease while finding some problems challenging.<br />
[/expand]
[expand title=&#8221;My Review&#8221; trigclass=&#8221;expandTitle&#8221; expanded=&#8221;true&#8221;]
This volume starts with a skill that I believe many players are lazy about: counting liberties. And to be honest, I did not realize how much I would have to struggle through this section. It wasn&#8217;t until I started working through these problems that I realized how lazy I&#8217;ve been and how weak I am at this fundamental skill. Though a bit of a shock, it was a good reminder of how weak my basics are.<br />
In this volume, a new problem type is introduced: profiting from your opponent&#8217;s overplays. This was by far one of the most surprising and enjoyable sections in the book since very little practice is ever given to players for this. Stronger players constantly tell weaker players to learn how to punish overplays, but there has been little material to focus on how to do so. Up till this book, I always found that learning to punish overplays came from experience and nothing else. Well, this section is that something else.<br />
Another thing that I noticed in this book is the categorization of life and death problems based on techniques. Most of the life and death books I have encountered thus far generally just include an assortment of problems, but I think that the categorization of problems based on technique is one of the more effective ways to teach players from the ground up. I definitely am hoping to see more of this in the future.<br />
And as if I wasn&#8217;t already impressed enough with this volume, they also take great care to teach the foundation behind the usage of certain moves or techniques. For example, many of us are familiar with what snapback is, but we don&#8217;t really get much training in regards to making the snapback. Another example would be practicing the double hane. Most players learn that it&#8217;s a useful move, but players are often forced to guess and learn the hard way in the middle of their game. And that can be painfully slow if you are only playing occassionally and do not have guidance at all.<br />
Finally, though it feels a little late in the series to finally see this, I&#8217;m really glad that they have a section devoted to training basic sente and gote understanding. Players can practice what I consider the most fundamental endgame problem: Find the sente endgame move. You might scoff at how simple that sounds, but I cannot count how many times I&#8217;ve seen kyu players just blatantly ignore sente plays for gote ones.<br />
Bottom line: Though I didn&#8217;t think they could improve the series much more, this volume just goes to show how well Lee Jae-Hwan understands breaking down the fundamentals of go into understable bite size pieces. Highly recommended!<br />
[/expand]
[expand title=&#8221;Synopsis&#8221; trigclass=&#8221;expandTitle&#8221;]
<strong>What did I enjoy about the book?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Forces players to understand counting liberties in capturing races.</li>
<li>Focuses on how to punish overplays that players commonly make.</li>
<li>Trains players on how to properly utilize moves like double hane.</li>
<li>Introduces sente and gote in an easy to understand manner.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What did I gain from reading this book?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Realization of how weak my liberty counting abilities are. They are stronger now, but I know that I still have a bit to go before I am confident in them.</li>
<li>Better understanding of how to use the double hane.</li>
<li>Sharpened intuition for utilizing tesuji like snapback and shortage of liberties.</li>
<li>Reinforced understanding of the foundation of endgame plays.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What is the format of the book?</strong></p>

</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What aspect can be improved on?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Page 145 &#8211; Directions should read: Black to play a sente move.</li>
<li>Page 162: Problem #20 &#8211; The solution in the answer book is technically correct in that it&#8217;s the best endgame sequence. However, it fails to what the problem is asking for (i.e., A, B, or C) since it chooses D (which does not exist in the book). For those who are looking for the simple answer, it is A.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Is this book easy to read?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Yes. It doesn&#8217;t get much more simple or straightforward than this.</li>

<strong>My Abilities</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>My reading skills and knowledge would probably equate to a solid 5 kyu at this point.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>My Perspective</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>After finishing the Level Up Series, I was really looking forward to what the intermediate level would have to offer.</li>
</ul>

[expand title=&#8221;Synopsis&#8221; trigclass=&#8221;expandTitle&#8221;]
<strong>What did I enjoy about the book?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>I like the fact that there is a section on how to blockade stones. Novel practice problems.</li>
<li>Reviews old joseki patterns and continues to teach new ones.</li>
<li>Started introducing endgame technique in regards to simple but effective tesuji that players often overlook.</li>
<li>Gives proper attention to the concepts of connections between stones.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What did I gain from reading this book?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Improved fundamentals in endgame techniques.</li>
<li>More familiarity with haengma (e.g., stone movement) regarding diving, blockading, and connections.</li>
<li>Reinforcement on my semeai (e.g., capturing races) skills.</li>
<li>Reinforcement of my understanding of tesuji such as jachung (e.g., shortage of liberties) and clamps.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What is the format of the book?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The book is primarily structured as follows: (1) A one page explanation of the topic that you are about to practice. Example: When behind in liberties. They not only show the sequence for the proper technique, but also include common mistakes and brief explanations as to why they are mistakes. (2) A set of very easy to understand and follow practice problems to ensure you understand what you are learning.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What aspect can be improved on?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>When learning about endgame techniques, there were a couple of problems where I had to figure it out for myself when solving it. In other words, there was no prior explanation that focused on that specific techniques (e.g., snapback). To be clear though, this occurred like in 1% of the problems, so it&#8217;s not a big issue at all; but it&#8217;s something I thought I would note.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Is this book easy to read?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Yes. It doesn&#8217;t get much more simple or straightforward than this.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Bottom Line</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Continues to live to the high expectations I have for this series.</li>
<li>An incredible way for players to immerse themselves and gain the ability to actually apply the concepts they are learning to their own games.</li>
<li>Worth every penny!</li>
</ol>

[expand title=&#8221;My Review&#8221; trigclass=&#8221;expandTitle&#8221; expanded=&#8221;true&#8221;]
When I first heard that there was an intermediate level of the Level Up Series, you can only imagine how ecstatic I was. And though part of me thought that it would suddenly be a lot more advanced, I am really pleased with how the transition is actually hardly noticeable.<br />
As usual with this series, I really love how I am just forced to practice concepts to the point where I am quite sick of it. The reason for this is that when you first learn a concept, it takes a bit of efforts in order to apply the concept. However, with their study method, I am now incredibly more comfortable at spotting out things such as jachung (e.g., shortage of liberties).<br />
And another thing I&#8217;ll note with about the Jump Level Up series, they still take no chances in letting fundamental skills such as falsifying eyes get even the slightest bit rusty. Though it might seem like you are repeating something &#8220;so simple,&#8221; I really appreciate that they do this since I still found myself answering some of the problems incorrectly (which clearly goes to show that my foundational skills are not quite flawless yet).<br />
