[expand title=&#8221;Synopsis&#8221; trigclass=&#8221;expandTitle&#8221; expanded=&#8221;true&#8221;]
<ol>
<li>It continues to amaze me how they REALLY drill even the most rudimentary concepts like making real eyes or falsifying an eye. No wonder Korean players are so well known for their reading abilities.</li>
<li>As we are now in the second half of the series, I think it has done a great job starting to pick up speed in terms of complexity of the problems while still focusing on the fundamentals.</li>
<li>Even though I never even thought about endgame when I first started learning the game, they already start introducing it in volume 6.</li>
</ol>
[/expand]
[expand title=&#8221;Before I Read This Book&#8230;&#8221; trigclass=&#8221;expandTitle&#8221;]
<strong>My Abilities</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A mid to high SDK (single digit kyu) kyu who has read his fair share of go books and has a pretty strong foundation in the basics and teaching go.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>My Perspective</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Since I was able to complete the first half of the series without much difficulty, I was expecting this to be start increasing in difficulty but still remain pretty easy to work through.</li>
</ul>
[/expand]
[expand title=&#8221;My Review&#8221; trigclass=&#8221;expandTitle&#8221; expanded=&#8221;true&#8221;]
<strong>What did I enjoy about the book?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Even though concepts like false eyes and snapback have been introduced and practiced quite repetitively in the first five volumes, they have no hesitation to continue drilling these concepts and ensuring that they truly become second nature.</li>
<li>They already start to introduce endgame! This blew my mind since I didn&#8217;t even both with endgame until much later on in my journey as a player.</li>
<li>It really starts to break down why certain moves are considered proper. For example, the rationale behind extending after being kicked is to play on the opponent&#8217;s vital point.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What did I gain from reading this book?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Polishing fundamental reading and analysis abilities.</li>
<li>A better understanding of why certain moves are the considered the proper response.</li>
<li>Feeling a little bit more comfortable with calculating the value of endgame moves.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What style of teaching does the book use?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Curriculum Style
<ul>
<li>Content is organized into lessons, topics, or themes in order to facilitate learning.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Primary Learning Mechanism:
<ul>
<li>Practice problems</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Other Learning Mechanisms:
<ul>
<li>Cute and entertaining comics to teach and/or reinforce lessons.</li>
<li>Simple explantations that are accompanied by equally simple diagrams.</li>
<li>Samples of openings from professional games to further acclimate the reader to full games on a 19&#215;19 board.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What aspect can be improved on?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>This is just a frivolous request, but I would&#8217;ve liked to have seen a few more endgame counting questions.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Is this book easy to read?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Yes. Other than the occasional article, the explanations are very easy short and easy to understand.</li>
</ul>
[/expand]
[expand title=&#8221;Recommended For&#8230;&#8221; trigclass=&#8221;expandTitle&#8221;]
<ul>
<li>Though the series is designed for kids, both kids and adults alike will be able to learn everything they need to know about playing go in a fun and entertaining way.</li>
<li>People who enjoy learning things in an easy to understand format and lots of opportunities to reinforce what they are learning.</li>

<li>Starts training the reader to practice looking for important stones.</li>
<li>They do a great job introducing seki and offer lots of really simple but effective practice problems for it.</li>

<ul>
<li>Polished my ability to distinguish between key stones in capturing races.</li>
<li>Started rebuilding my ability to see seki positions from the ground up.</li>

<strong>What did I enjoy about the book?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>I enjoyed that they use &#8220;next move&#8221; questions that provide a mini-simulation of what kind of decisions you might make in a game.</li>
<li>When drilling life and death shapes, they spare no effort in making sure you not only know where the vital point of the shape is, but how to create the shape when killing your opponent or avoiding offering the opponent a chance to create the shape.</li>
<li>Does a great job introducing dame (aka neutral) points and giving the reader opportunities to practice finding them along with how to be careful about how accidentally filling the wrong dame points can actually cause problems.</li>
<li>Introduces &#8220;endgame&#8221; at its most basic level: closing off or reducing territory.</li>

<p><strong>What aspect can be improved on?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Up to this point, the answer books have been great on its own. For this book however, I noticed that there were times where answers to questions that asked the reader &#8220;Which direction to block?&#8221; would be best served if there were a short explanation as to why. Granted, this may be omitted due to it being used in a school setting where a go teacher would explain it; but if the answer books are intended to be sufficient without a teacher, then this would be very helpful.</li>

<ul>
<li>Yes. It was very easy to understand all the explanations and progress through the book.</li>

<strong>My Abilities</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A mid to high SDK (single digit kyu) kyu who has read his fair share of go books and has a pretty strong foundation in the basics and teaching go.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>My Perspective</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Both <a title="Book Review: Level Up 1" href="//book-review-level-up-1/">Level Up 1</a> and <a title="Book Review: Level Up 2" href="//book-review-level-up-vol-2/">Level Up 2</a> had surpassed my expectations, so I was excited for what was store for me in this book!</li>

[expand title=&#8221;My Review&#8221; trigclass=&#8221;expandTitle&#8221; expanded=&#8221;true&#8221;]
<strong>What did I enjoy about the book?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The introduction to basic life and death shapes is very thorough.</li>
<li>The way they progress the reader from simple diagrams to more complicated diagrams still continues to amaze me. A job well done!</li>
<li>Though Level Up 2 spent a bit of time on ladders, they still have ladder problems to continue honing and refining the reader&#8217;s ladder skills.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What did I gain from reading this book?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Polished my reading fundamentals.</li>
<li>Increased my speed at analyzing the status between two groups and determining which group to target if any.</li>
<li>Improved my ability to see basic connections and verify that they cannot be cut regardless of what the opponent tries.</li>

</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What aspect can be improved on?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>I noticed that the answer book is sometimes incorrect or simply has the wrong diagram. This should be fixed since newer players could find it frustrating or end up learning the incorrect material.</li>

</ul>
<p><strong>My Perspective</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>After reading <a title="Book Review: Level Up 1" href="//book-review-level-up-1/">Level Up 1</a>, I was just excited to get started on the second book and keep the momentum going!</li>
</ul>
[/expand]
[expand title=&#8221;My Review&#8221; trigclass=&#8221;expandTitle&#8221; expanded=&#8221;true&#8221;]
<strong>What did I enjoy about the book?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>It forces you to review (and inadvertently reinforce) what you learned in <a title="Book Review: Level Up 1" href="//book-review-level-up-1/">Level Up 1</a>.</li>
<li>Introduces life and death at its most fundamental level (i.e.,making your second eye) and drills the reader in finding it or taking it away.</li>
<li>Spends a lot of time on ladders and gives the reader lots of opportunity to practice reading simple ladders. This is one of my favorite parts about this book since ladders are something that most players tend to shy away from.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What did I gain from reading this book?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Polishing my ladder reading abilities.</li>
<li>Polishing my ability to accurately read out multiple variations since I&#8217;m double checking why the other answer doesn&#8217;t work.</li>
<li>Better understanding of how to break down concepts like ladders when teaching go to newer players.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What style of teaching does the book use?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Workbook Approach
<ul>
<li>There are less explanations and more problems in this book, but any reader who has diligently followed practiced the problems from <a title="Book Review: Level Up 1" href="//book-review-level-up-1/">Level Up 1</a> should have no issues solving the problems.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Primary Learning Mechanism
<ul>
<li>Solving problems.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Other Learning Mechanisms
<ul>
<li>Cute comics to illustrate concepts like, &#8220;Before capturing your opponent, look at your own weak points.&#8221;</li>
<li>Multiple choice questions such as,&#8221; Who has made better territory?&#8221;</li>
<li>Kifus (i.e., game records) that are only around 10 moves long with short one line statements of the move&#8217;s purpose.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What aspects can be improved on?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The concept of chokchoksu (which is essentially shortage of liberties) should be introduced earlier on since there are a number of problems that use it in the solution.</li>
<li>The answer book for Question #2 for page 163 should be &#8220;net.&#8221;</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Is this book easy to read?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Yes. It was very easy to progress through the book.</li>

<ol>
<li>The best introductory book that I have encountered thus far.</li>
<li>Imagine one of those practice workbooks you used to have in school, except about go.</li>
<li>Does a fantastic job giving the reader lots of opportunity to reinforce the concepts they learn.</li>
</ol>

[expand title=&#8221;Before I Read This Book&#8230;&#8221; trigclass=&#8221;expandTitle&#8221;]
<strong>My Abilities</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A 5 kyu who has read his fair share of go books and has a pretty strong foundation in the basics and teaching go.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>My Perspective</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>I was looking for a series that could fill the missing niche of breaking down concepts in an easy to understand manner while giving lots of opportunity to practice what they just learned.</li>
</ul>
[/expand]
[expand title=&#8221;My Review&#8221; trigclass=&#8221;expandTitle&#8221; expanded=&#8221;true&#8221;]
<strong>What did I enjoy about the book?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The diagrams and explanations are very simple and very easy to follow, which is ideal for new players.</li>
<li>There are lots of opportunity to reinforce the concept being taught regardless of how &#8220;easy&#8221; it is.</li>
<li>It is very evident that a lot of effort went into structuring the content like a curriculum so that it builds upon previous concepts as the reader progresses.</li>
<li>They do a great job with acclimating the reader to more complicated diagrams. For example, the first capture scenarios literally only involve one group. Next round, they add some miscellaneous stones to the diagram while still marking the important stones to start acclimating the reader to seeing more complicated diagrams. Love it.</li>
<li>Though the book is designed for kids, both kids and adults alike will be able to learn everything they need to know about playing go in a fun and entertaining way.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What did I gain from reading this book?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Even though I already know all of these concepts, forcing myself to go through the book from start to finish was a great way for me to ensure that my reading abilities were 100% with even the most basic problems.</li>
<li>The school and workbook-like approach to teaching go has definitely helped me improve the way that I will be teaching go in the future.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What style of teaching does the book use?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Workbook Approach
<ul>
<li>They introduce concepts within one to two lines with diagrams to support them.</li>
<li>Once they introduce a concept, they provide multiple opportunities for practice.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Primary Teaching Mechanism:
<ul>
<li>Solving simple and easy problems.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Other Teaching Mechanisms:
<ul>
<li>Explanations with really easy multiple choice questions.</li>
<li>Kifus (i.e., game records) that are only around 10 moves long with short one line statements of the move&#8217;s purpose.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What aspect(s) can be improved on?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Sometimes the directions are misleading. For example, the direction is to atari the marked stones, but the problem&#8217;s solution is actually to capture. Two different objectives.</li>
<li>While most of the book is structured very well, sometimes the problems get ahead of themselves. For example, the directions are to atari the stones, but you need to actually be able to read out the ladder to know which way to atari.</li>
<li>For the next edition, I would recommend that jachung (i.e., reducing your own liberties) be introduced earlier since some problems prior to the explanation actually utilize it.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Is this book easy to read?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>It was very easy to progress through the book.</li>
<li>The English is not always the most grammatically correct, but the message is still pretty clear.</li>
</ul>
[/expand]

<h3>Detailed Review</h3>
<h4>Readability &#8211; 10 / 10</h4>
<p>The diagrams begin to get a little bit more complicated in this volume. While this may seem slightly daunting at first, this is excellent exposure to how things will look when you&#8217;re actually playing a game. In addition, the problems are still kept to a simplicity that will further ease the transition into bigger boards and more complicated positions.<br />

<h4>Content Quality &#8211; 10 / 10</h4>
<p>While the cover states that the book is appropriate for 25 kyu to 20 kyu players, if you can do all the problems in these book, you are most likely going to be in the 12 to 15 kyu range.<br />

<h3>Detailed Review</h3>
<h4>Readability &#8211; 10 / 10</h4>
<p>One of my favorite aspects about this book is the fact that the diagrams are so large (in comparison to typical <a href="http://senseis.xmp.net/?Tsumego">tsumego</a> you might find). The use of smaller boards (e.g., 13&#215;13) and bigger pieces makes the problems very inviting and less intimidating.<br />
For overall readability explanation, see the readability section in the <a title="Book Review: Graded Go Problems for Beginners Series" href="//book-review-graded-go-problems-for-beginners-series/">review on the entire series</a>.</p>
<h4>Content Quality &#8211; 10 / 10</h4>
<p>The problems in this volume are a remarkable collection of fundamental concepts that every go player should know (regardless of your approach to the game).<br />
While the cover states that the book is appropriate for 30 kyu to 25 kyu players, if you can do all the problems in these book, you are most likely going to be in the 20 kyu range.<br />
