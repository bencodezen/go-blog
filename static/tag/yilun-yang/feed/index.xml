<strong>My Abilities</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A mid-high SDK (single digit kyu) who has read his fair share of books and has a decent foundation of most areas in go.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>My Perspective</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Since these are written to be more of a &#8220;workshop&#8221; format, I was looking forward to a new style of writing along with a refreshing perspective on some common questions that most players might have.</li>
</ul>
[/expand]
[expand title=&#8221;Synopsis&#8221; trigclass=&#8221;expandTitle&#8221;]
<strong>What did I enjoy about the book?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>As usual, Yang continues to breakdown topics into simple explanations that I could easily understand.</li>
<li>I really enjoy the fact that he takes on topics that go literature tends to overlook for amateurs. An example of this is &#8220;Handling Unusual Opening Moves.&#8221;</li>
<li>The diagrams are short and quite easy to follow.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What did I gain from reading this book?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Improved ability to recognize what areas on the board are important and big.</li>
<li>Better understanding of how to determine what my next move should be in the opening.</li>
<li>Much clearer direction in regards to how one should handle unusual opening moves.</li>
<li>An improved grasp on how I should protect my positions on the board.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What style of teaching does the book use?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Similar to his previous books in this series, the teaching format primarily consists of explanations regarding the topic at hand in conjunction with diagrams that have the reader test his/her ability. Then, after the problem is given, Yang typically goes into an extensive (but simple to understand) explanation of the various things the reader should consider when approaching the problem.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What aspect can be improved on?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>No complaints from me!</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Is this book easy to read?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Yes. The explanations are concise and the accompanying diagrams are often no more than a few moves long.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Bottom Line</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Breaks down topics into easy to understand explanations.</li>
<li>Has a lot of valuable content for such a short book!</li>
<li>Worth every penny you spend on it!</li>
</ol>

[expand title=&#8221;My Review&#8221; trigclass=&#8221;expandTitle&#8221; expanded=&#8221;true&#8221;]
The topics that are covered in this book are incredibly useful to many players (particularly kyu level players). Though I am still far from being able to implement his advice flawlessly, I am still blown away by Yang&#8217;s ability to take common topics that plague weaker players and convey them in a manner that we can understand without boring us to death. So if you have any interest in the topics covered in this volume, be sure to pick up a copy!<br />

[expand title=&#8221;My Review&#8221; trigclass=&#8221;expandTitle&#8221; expanded=&#8221;true&#8221;]
Though I was not as fond of Volume 3, I really enjoyed all of the topics that were covered here in this volume. Topics such as shape and fast vs. slow moves have always interested me and I&#8217;m always glad to learn about it from a different perspective. In addition, this is the first time that I&#8217;ve seen go literature cover something as unqiue as &#8220;playing a fighting opening!&#8221; So with all these unique and fascinating topics, I have to say that this is probably my favorite one thus far.<br />

[expand title=&#8221;My Review&#8221; trigclass=&#8221;expandTitle&#8221; expanded=&#8221;true&#8221;]
In this volume, I found that the sections on the opening were a little harder to grasp. This is probably due to the fact that the nature of the opening is rather vast and thus trying to condense it down into a few pages is rather difficult. The forcing move section was also a little bit tough for me to really grab hold of as well. I imagine this is due to the fact that the whole concept of &#8220;timing&#8221; in go is not so easily summed up in a few pages. On the other hand though, I was very impressed by the sections regarding weak groups. And in my opinion, those two sections make the entire book worth purchasing.<br />

</ul>
<p><strong>What style of teaching does the book use?</strong></p>

[expand title=&#8221;Before I Read This Book&#8230;&#8221; trigclass=&#8221;expandTitle&#8221;]
<strong>My Abilities</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A mid-high SDK (single digit kyu) who has read his fair share of books and has a decent foundation of most areas in go.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>My Perspective</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Since these are written to be more of a &#8220;workshop&#8221; format, I was looking forward to a new style of writing along with a refreshing perspective on some common questions that most players might have.</li>
</ul>
[/expand]
[expand title=&#8221;My Review&#8221; trigclass=&#8221;expandTitle&#8221; expanded=&#8221;true&#8221;]
This was a refreshing perspective on common go questions. Yilun Yang&#8217;s ability to break down popular topics like &#8220;Determining What Direction to Attack&#8221; was incredibly easy to understand. Contrary to some typical go literature where the concept is explained to death, Yang provides more of a road map on how to actually apply the principle instead of simply understanding it. Now granted, I will be the first to say that actually applying it to your game is not so easy; but my understanding has certainly grown and I am now trying out new things as a result. I am really looking forward to the next books in the series!<br />
