				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I have no idea what&#8217;s going on. It&#8217;s like whenever I play a ranked game, my personality changes and I become hell-bent on destroying groups. Any notion of growth or progress that I&#8217;ve made seems to be thrown out the window. How frustrating!<br />
I think part of my problem is that I stop reading when I play people around my rank. I just play moves that feel okay and then try and repair the damage later on. In addition, I have no notion of giving any leeway to my opponent. It&#8217;s quite mind boggling&#8230;<br />
A game of go is a game of go&#8230; It should make absolutely no difference if it is ranked or free. The problem now is to figure out how to hit my zen state when playing ranked games&#8230;</p>
