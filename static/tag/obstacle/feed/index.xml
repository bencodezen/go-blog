				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Last night I had the pleasure of playing fellow go twitter friend <a href="http://www.twitter.com/gobum">goBum</a>. For our first game against one another, I thought it was exciting and a lot of fun. Afterwards though, we were severely reminded of the numerous mistakes that occurred throughout the game. Of the two of us though, I would have to say that my play was probably the most shameful. Haha. And if you&#8217;re wondering what kind of moves I&#8217;m talking about, I mean the whole gamut of making empty triangles that are thank you moves along with playing impulsive moves that are the equivalent of passing. Needless to say, I got what I deserved when it came to verbal bashing. Haha. xD<br />
Since I&#8217;m a glutton for punishment, I decided to also show the game to sensei today. As I expected, the feedback wasn&#8217;t much better from his end either. Haha. However, he pointed out a critical flaw in my play: I still play from a pressured player mindset. In other words, I get so entangled in myself that I fail to analyze the board correctly. I fail to separate myself from what is happening on the board. Instead of calm analysis of what&#8217;s going on, any slight deviation from what I expected led to me feeling like it as a personal failure instead of a simple change on the board to be accounted for. As a result, the impulsive and reckless moves that plague my game are inevitable.<br />
To separate myself from the game when I play&#8230; What a cumbersome obstacle I have in my way&#8230;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As you know, I have been in a rather &#8220;meh&#8221; mood when it comes to playing go. It&#8217;s not so much that I&#8217;ve lost interest in the game, but I found my play style becoming very scattered and ugly. It wasn&#8217;t until recently that frozensoul helped to shed light on the issue and told me that I have entered a &#8220;paranoid go&#8221; phase. My moves are played haphazardly and often lack a sense of focus and purpose. Although I once wrote of this roadblock as being a &#8220;mood&#8221; issue, it seems that it may actually be a rather large obstacle that I must overcome.<br />
In order to mediate this, I have taken a big step back from playing and have re-incorporated studying professional games into my routine. The aim of doing this is to try and unlock my paranoia of letting my opponents have any ideal opening or framework which often caused me to overextend myself which then resulted in my resignation.<br />
At this point in my journey, my abilities seem to fluctuate rather violently depending on my opponent and their play style. This is unacceptable for me, since I despise the idea that the player I am becoming is one that is blatantly weak to certain styles and then overpowering against others. My go should shine on its own regardless of who my opponent is. And to clarify, this does not mean I think I will win all of my games; but instead, I want all of my games to be interesting and something I can be proud to show to anyone.<br />
So while I am currently lost out in the sea paranoid go, when I find my way back onto the path of zen go: opponents beware. =)</p>
