				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Man&#8230;. it&#8217;s only day four of February&#8217;s training regimen and I can already feel the weight of it bearing down on me. On top of that, I&#8217;m playing even more even games with players 5+ stones stronger than me and getting crushed left and right. Not feeling bad about myself or anything, but definitely slightly winded. The good thing is that I think I&#8217;m starting to become more immune to losing, but we&#8217;ll have to wait and see if that&#8217;s true. =D<br />
As I continue to try and analyze the gaps in my ability, I&#8217;ve found that watching other people&#8217;s games has been helpful in reinforcing my understanding of the game. While I find myself wanting to yell at the screen when people choose a variation that is in favor of their opponent, the experience is quite humorous as a whole and helps me to see the gaps in other players&#8217; knowledge; which in turn helps to fill mine.<br />
Nonetheless, it seems I&#8217;m a track to straight losses in ASR; but hopefully I can rack up enough points to stay in the class. Here&#8217;s to hoping!</p>
