				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 style="text-align: center;">Introduction</h2>
<p>For this week&#8217;s go meditation, we continue our walk down memory lane. I am a 13 kyu this week and played a game that was very surprising for me. To put it in another sense, I had a hard time believing that I had really played such a game as a 13k! In fact, this game puts some of my games as a SDK (i.e., single digit kyu) to shame. Haha. It makes me wonder what has happened to my go and whether there is something to be said about how I used to play versus how I play now. So much to think aboutâ€¦ Anyhow, I hope that you will enjoy this game and find this game as surprising as I did! It seriously is an impressive game for two 13 kyus!<a href="//wp-content/uploads/2013/10/2013.10.28-MGM-33.sgf"><br />

<p style="text-align: center;">When trying to kill a group, be careful not to let your groups get cut up. Otherwise you might find yourself in a dire capturing race that you cannot win.</p>
