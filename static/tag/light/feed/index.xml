<strong>What&#8217;s the best aspect about this product?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Light-weight and super affordable!</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What is the weakest aspect of this product?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Upon close inspection, the lines are not as clean as you&#8217;ll see on more expensive boards; but it still does the job well!</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Is it durable?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>After handling it, I see no reason why it won&#8217;t hold up to normal usage. However, if somewhere were to try and karate chop this board, I&#8217;m pretty sure it&#8217;d break. xD</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Bottom Line</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>A great go board for someone on a budget!</li>
<li>And in the event you know how to play Chinese chess, there&#8217;s a board of that on the back as well!</li>
<li>Definitely recommended over paper and/or plastic boards that exist out there!</li>
</ol>

[expand title=&#8221;My Review&#8221; trigclass=&#8221;expandTitle&#8221; expanded=&#8221;true&#8221;]
Here&#8217;s the front of the board at a slanted angle. It&#8217;s a nice yellow color to give it a semi-shin-kaya feel. (I prefer the yellow color over brown since it shows more contrast when stones are placed on the board; but that&#8217;s just a personal preference.)</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/01/dirtcheapgoboard02.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-4544" alt="dirtcheapgoboard02" src="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/01/dirtcheapgoboard02.jpg?resize=360%2C270" width="360" height="270" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">And here below, you can see that there&#8217;s a Chinese chess board on the back!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/01/dirtcheapgoboard03.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-4545" alt="dirtcheapgoboard03" src="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/01/dirtcheapgoboard03.jpg?resize=360%2C270" width="360" height="270" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Upon closer inspection, you&#8217;ll see that the lines are not perfectly straight the way you&#8217;ll see on higher quality boards. However, I wouldn&#8217;t let this be a deterrent from purchasing the board if it&#8217;s being used for casual play.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/01/dirtcheapgoboard04.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-4546" alt="dirtcheapgoboard04" src="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/01/dirtcheapgoboard04.jpg?resize=360%2C270" width="360" height="270" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Here are a couple of shots with the board in action with my size 36 glass stones. As you can see, the lines are not so obvious from a player&#8217;s perspective.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/01/dirtcheapgoboard05.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-4547" alt="dirtcheapgoboard05" src="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/01/dirtcheapgoboard05.jpg?resize=360%2C270" width="360" height="270" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/01/dirtcheapgoboard06.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-4548" alt="dirtcheapgoboard06" src="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/01/dirtcheapgoboard06.jpg?resize=360%2C270" width="360" height="270" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/01/dirtcheapgoboard07.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-4549" alt="dirtcheapgoboard07" src="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/01/dirtcheapgoboard07.jpg?resize=360%2C270" width="360" height="270" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Bottom line: I highly recommend this board for people who are looking to purchase boards for their club or for tournaments. This board would also function well as a casual study/playing board. However, I would definitely not recommend this as a primary goban for anyone who is looking for that classic air and sound you get from true wooden boards. So remember, the key thing to remember is that this is a board that focuses on affordability and practicality.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">The Featherweight Go Set</h2>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> &#8220;Weighing in at just 20.5 oz (580 g), the Featherweight Go Set is even lighter than your average travel Go set. But here&#8217;s the thing; it&#8217;s a proper, full sized Go board with stones. It includes size 21 plastic stones (0.3 inches or 8 mm thick) with a 0.8 inch (20 mm) diameter and a durable, full size, crease resistant 19&#215;19 plastic Go board. The board can easily be folded or rolled, making this set highly portable. Keep a set in your bag or briefcase so that you&#8217;re always ready for a serendipitous game of Go!&#8221; &#8211; GoGameGuru<br />

<strong>What&#8217;s the best aspect about this product?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Portability! It&#8217;s one of the lightest products I&#8217;ve encountered while still maintaining decent quality!</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What is the weakest aspect of this product?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>As someone who is used to using real stones, the stones can feel a bit lighter than desired; but to be honest, it beats not having any board or stones to play when you&#8217;re out and about!</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Is it durable?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The stones are plastic and should hold up well enough. The board is made of fabric so it shouldn&#8217;t tear so easily, but will probably wear out over time with use and will eventually need replacing.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Bottom Line</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Great lightweight go set for that one can easily pack without noticing any additional weight or bulkiness.</li>
<li>Recommended for any player looking to always have a go set on hand without the hassle or concern over the safety of a wooden board or real stones.</li>
</ol>

[expand title=&#8221;My Review&#8221; trigclass=&#8221;expandTitle&#8221; expanded=&#8221;true&#8221;]
True to their word, this featherweight go set came packed in a super light way with no bulky boxes!<br />
<figure id="attachment_4492" style="width: 360px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/01/featherweightgoset02.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-4492" alt="featherweightgoset02" src="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/01/featherweightgoset02.jpg?resize=360%2C270" width="360" height="270" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">As you can see, everything fits in one bag!</figcaption></figure>
<figure id="attachment_4493" style="width: 360px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/01/featherweightgoset03.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-4493" alt="featherweightgoset03" src="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/01/featherweightgoset03.jpg?resize=360%2C270" width="360" height="270" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Contents of the bag: two bags of stones and one board</figcaption></figure>
<figure id="attachment_4494" style="width: 360px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/01/featherweightgoset04.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-4494" alt="featherweightgoset04" src="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/01/featherweightgoset04.jpg?resize=360%2C270" width="360" height="270" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">The board unfolded</figcaption></figure>
The board is made of fabric and has a nice feel to it. It does have a little issue staying flat after being packaged and folded for so long, but a little patience and flattening helped to keep it pretty straight. And like the description says, it really does feel like a full size board when you spread it out over the table.<br />
<figure id="attachment_4495" style="width: 360px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/01/featherweightgoset05.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-4495" alt="featherweightgoset05" src="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/01/featherweightgoset05.jpg?resize=360%2C270" width="360" height="270" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Close-up of the stones</figcaption></figure>
As you can see for the stones, they are not simply plastic biconvex stones; but they also have a flat center on both sides in order to ease with the stone placement on the board. Though this is contrary to typical stone design, I think that this works out great for this set since the plastic stones are not very heavy to begin with. So as a result, the flat center really helps out.<br />
<figure id="attachment_4496" style="width: 360px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/01/featherweightgoset06.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-4496" alt="featherweightgoset06" src="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/01/featherweightgoset06.jpg?resize=360%2C270" width="360" height="270" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Entire set in action</figcaption></figure>
<figure id="attachment_4497" style="width: 360px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/01/featherweightgoset07.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-4497" alt="featherweightgoset07" src="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/01/featherweightgoset07.jpg?resize=360%2C270" width="360" height="270" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Close-up of the set in action</figcaption></figure>
As you can see, it&#8217;s a great set that really provides a wonderful experience when it&#8217;s impossible to carry around a wooden board and real stones. As someone who has used cheaper &#8220;featherweight&#8221; sets that were plastic boards and such, this is a huge improvement and is the one I recommend if you&#8217;re looking for your &#8220;featherweight go set.&#8221; Hope this helped!<br />
