				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Upon trying to continue my study of Lee Sedol&#8217;s book, I have realized that it will be impossible for me to properly study it. While it is easy to simply replay the moves, I realized that simply going through the motions was not doing me any good. I want to try and absorb as much of his explanations as much as possible, and frankly with my schedule I simply don&#8217;t have the time to do so unless I let everything else in my life go to a complete mess. =D So I&#8217;ll be shelving the book for this month, but no worries, that is all the training adjustments that will happen for this month. Onward I go!</p>
