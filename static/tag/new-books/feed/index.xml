				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2013/06/levelcollection.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-3129" alt="levelcollection" src="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2013/06/levelcollection.jpg?resize=210%2C279" width="210" height="279" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>If you&#8217;re wondering whether or not that&#8217;s my personal collection of Level Up/Jump Up books, it&#8217;s not. It&#8217;s just a sneak peak of the shipment that will be coming in the near future. xD<br />
That&#8217;s right&#8230; As if I didn&#8217;t have enough books to work on already, the chance to study Korean school texts firsthand was too much to resist. So you will be seeing firsthand as I work my way through the entire series what I think of the books and whether or not you should give it a shot.<br />
Although this purchase would probably qualify enough for the blog post&#8217;s title, there was a go classified ad for books on sale and I ended up picking up a couple out of print books along with another Korean series called <em>Train Like a Pro</em>. (I know&#8230; what is wrong with me&#8230;)<br />
My credit card might be slightly melted, but I hope it&#8217;ll forgive me because the rest of the year is looking awesome!</p>
