<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Though this week cannot even begin to live up to 1% of the awesomeness that is happening on at US Go Congress, I will have to say that it has been a rather productive week. I&#8217;ve started really diving into some new books in an effort to really further my understanding of my failure as a player: the inability to attack properly. If you&#8217;re wondering why I make it sound so dramatic, it&#8217;s because I always considered myself more of a fighter / power type of player, and what kind of fighter or power player am I if I can&#8217;t even attack properly? Haha. =D But I think I&#8217;m making good headway on that, so hopefully I won&#8217;t have to write about this weakness of mine for much longer. Till next week!</p>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Friday Go Forward has officially half a year old! Woot! Hard to believe that 6 months have passed since I first started this weekly series, but I&#8217;m definitely glad that fellow go player Feather suggested it to me! It&#8217;s certainly been really helpful to document my own progress and force myself to evaluate how each week is going.<br />
With that happy note said and done, this week has been a great launching point to start diving back into playing again. Though I am still finding it difficult to find the time to properly play a ranked game with proper time settings, it has been good to simply stretch my go legs once again. As some might notice in my training below, it also seems like my studying has ramped up again; but I assure you that I am definitely taking it a lot slower with my studying. I&#8217;m just simply letting the go <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muse">muses</a> inspire me as I continue my journey to gain another stone. Whatever topic comes to mind that I&#8217;m interested in is what I study. Might seem haphazard, but I&#8217;m actually having quite a bit of fun. =D</p>
<h2>Games</h2>
<ul>
<li>KGS &#8211; 4 games</li>
<li>DGS &#8211; 3 ongoing games</li>
<li>Nova &#8211; 3 ongoing games</li>
</ul>
<h2>Education &amp; Training</h2>
<ul>
<li><em></em>Started and finished <em>Level Up 10</em>.<em><br />
</em></li>
<li>Started and finished <em>Level Up Review 2</em>.</li>
<li>Started and finished <em>The Workshop Lectures Volume 1</em>.</li>
<li>Started working on <i>Jump Level Up 1.</i></li>
<li>Started working on <em>Joseki Jeongseok Compass</em>.</li>
<li>Started working on <em>Get Strong at the Opening</em>.</li>
<li>Started working on <em>The Workshop Lectures Volume 2</em>.</li>
<li>Started working on <em>Takao&#8217;s Astute Use of Brute Force</em>.</li>
<li>Started working on <em>Vital Points and Skillful Finesse for Sabaki.</em></li>
</ul>
<h2>Lesson Learned</h2>
<ol>
<li>Although studying and learning about theory is important, application is just as critical (if not more so) to one&#8217;s growth as well. Thanks to moboy78 for reminding me of that.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>If it isn&#8217;t apparent, my studying sessions have gotten pretty crazy. I know that it would be better for me to focus on one book at a time, but my attention span just can&#8217;t handle too much of one topic. As much as I&#8217;d love to fully absorb everything I&#8217;m reading, my goal is to absorb as much as possible with the least amount of time and effort. Therefore, if I am getting bored and not really paying attention anymore, I move on to another topic.<br />
I know it&#8217;s not the most thorough method, but I have a lot of books that I&#8217;d love to read and different explanations to be exposed to. Once I&#8217;ve reviewed every book that I own, you can be sure that I will be returning to the ones that I want to really gain a mastery over. So for now, I&#8217;m okay with being a jack of all trades and master of none. xD</p>
