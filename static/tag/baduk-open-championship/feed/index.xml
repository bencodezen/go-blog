				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 style="text-align: left;">Overview</h2>
<p>As many of you know, I spent the past weekend at the <a title="1st Washington Open Baduk Championship — Part I" href="//1st-washington-open-baduk-championship-part/">1st Washington Baduk Open Championship</a> and have been therefore swamped with trying to make sure I took the time to write the posts before too much time had passed. It was an eye-opening experience that has given me an opportunity to really change my perspectives on how I&#8217;ve been approaching go. Especially after talking with Myung (9p) with some of his thoughts, I definitely am looking to make some changes to my training regimen.<br />
The only other thing that&#8217;s worth mentioning is that I am officially making a move away from KGS to either WBaduk or Tygem (depending on whichever I can get running on my Mac). It&#8217;s not that I won&#8217;t be logged in anymore or will refuse to play on it, but I&#8217;ll be reserving KGS for playing with friends and anyone who asks me for a game. Otherwise, my focus on playing &#8220;ranked games&#8221; will be moving to the Korean servers. More on that to come when I have a well formulated thought as to why I&#8217;m doing this. Till next week!</p>
