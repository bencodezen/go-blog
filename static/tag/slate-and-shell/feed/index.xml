<h2 style="text-align: center;">Slate and Shell Go Stones &#8211; Sample Pack &#8211; Size 36 Biconvex</h2>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> &#8220;This is a sample pack of our size 36 slate and shell Go stones, which are among the highest quality Go stones available. It contains three black stones and three white stones. Size 36 refers to the thickness of the stone (in this case 10.4 mm or 0.41 inches). The additional thickness and weight of these stones gives them a pleasant feeling in your hand and produces a sharp and satisfying snapping sound when the stones are played.&#8221; &#8211; GoGameGuru<br />

[expand title=&#8221;Synopsis&#8221; trigclass=&#8221;expandTitle&#8221;]
<strong>What&#8217;s the best aspect about this product?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>It&#8217;s slate and shell. &#8216;Nuff said.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What is the weakest aspect of this product?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Size 36 is pretty big, so if someone is not accounting for it, their board might seem a bit crowded if the board is not drawn to accommodate for it.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Is it durable?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>It&#8217;s slate and shell. Haha. I&#8217;d recommend you handle with care.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Bottom Line</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Totally worth the money if you wanted to ever check out what slate and shell stones are like before investing a lot of money into a set.</li>

[expand title=&#8221;My Review&#8221; trigclass=&#8221;expandTitle&#8221; expanded=&#8221;true&#8221;]
The sample comes in a nice little cloth bag with the BadukBrother logo clearly marked.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/02/slateshellsample02.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-4594" alt="slateshellsample02" src="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/02/slateshellsample02.jpg?resize=490%2C368" width="490" height="368" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">When you remove the stones from the bag, you can see that it is in a nice plastic bag (which provides the actual protection in shipping).</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/02/slateshellsample03.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-4595" alt="slateshellsample03" src="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/02/slateshellsample03.jpg?resize=368%2C490" width="368" height="490" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">With the stones removed, you can see them glistening in the light. Very pretty. =)</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/02/slateshellsample04.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-4596" alt="slateshellsample04" src="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/02/slateshellsample04.jpg?resize=490%2C368" width="490" height="368" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The one thing I will say is that the beautiful pattern you are used to seeing on shell stones was harder to capture in the pictures. I think that this is due to the fact that the size of the stones (and for those who don&#8217;t know, size 36 is pretty large) and that this is a sample pack is a reason for why the pattern is more faded compared to the set that I own. However, since this is not a full set, I would not take this as an alarming fact since your purpose with this sample pack is to really get a feel for slate and shell as opposed to just the look.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/02/slateshellsample05.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-4597" alt="slateshellsample05" src="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/02/slateshellsample05.jpg?resize=490%2C368" width="490" height="368" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">At the end of the day, they arrived in perfect condition which is precisely what someone needs when they want to find out if they really want to own a set of slate and shell. If you&#8217;re interested in getting a slate and shell stone set but worried if the value is worth the price, be sure to grab one of these sample packs from GoGameGuru to help you make an informed decision. Good luck!</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">PS. I do own a full set of slate and shell stones, so let me know if you ever have any questions.</p>
