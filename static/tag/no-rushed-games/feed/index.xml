				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It seems I&#8217;ve hit a bit of a playing slump recently. Every time I&#8217;m asked to play a game, I find myself turning down most games (except in rare cases where frozen or a friend asks for a game).<br />
It&#8217;s not so much that I don&#8217;t like playing anymore, but each time I want to start a game, I have this nagging feeling that something else needs to be done or start feeling worried that I&#8217;ll be interrupted. After all, a full game of go for me can easily take anywhere from 1.5 to 2 hours without skipping a beat. And frankly, life has not been too lenient in terms of giving me 2 hour blocks of time to play a game of go. As a result, I&#8217;ve been rather hesitant lately to play any ranked/tournament games for fear of needing to leave, resign, or rush the game.<br />
For those who have been following, that is a recipe for disaster for my go. Odds are very good that I will end up regretting the game I played.Â So to avoid me possibly going on tilt or becoming frustrated, I&#8217;ve been doing a bit of reading, studying, watching, and reviewing other people&#8217;s games in order to get my go fix. Although I know it isn&#8217;t quite the same as playing the game, my little workaround will have to suffice until life eases up a bit.</p>
