<h2 style="text-align: center;">Introduction</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">When it comes to traveling, my number one priority is always to find the most authentic food to that area. The more special it is to the area (aka I can&#8217;t get it anywhere else in the world) the better. And for those who aren&#8217;t following me on <a href="http://www.twitter.com/bengozen">Twitter</a> already, you&#8217;ll notice that my Twitter consists primarily of go and food. So as you might expect, I&#8217;m quite enthusiastic about food and thus this post is a tad lengthier than normal.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">With that said, I hope you prepare yourself as you set off with me to relive my food adventures through Hong Kong, and be sure to read to the end because I recount my experience with a buffet that costs $100USD per person. No that is not a typo. See you at the the bottom!</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Part 2 &#8211; The Food</h2>
<p>For starters, I&#8217;ll have to say that while we had some recommendations on places to go, my family and I were mostly on our own when it came to figuring out what we wanted to eat.<br />
When we had finally escaped surviving on airplane food for the last 13+ hours, you can imagine our desire to find some actual food. Nothing microwaved or mushy. Just legit Hong Kong food. And even though it took us a bit before we got settled in at our hotel, we were fortune enough that there were some places open nearby. To top it off, we were incredibly lucky to pick the one place where they had excellent wonton egg noodle soup. Definitely the best I had the entire trip!<br />
<figure id="attachment_4966" style="width: 384px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014HKP2-01.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-4966" alt="2014HKP2-01" src="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014HKP2-01-768x1024.jpg?resize=384%2C512" width="384" height="512" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Best wonton egg noodle soup dish I had the entire trip!</figcaption></figure>
<span id="more-4953"></span><br />
One thing I learned about Hong Kong is that all of the breakfast (at least in the restaurant I went to) they served were primarily soup. After eating a rather abysmal breakfast one time, we eventually found this number nearby our hotel which had a great pork chop that went really well with instant noodles. I know I know&#8230; instant noodles? Well after my first terrible breakfast experience, instant noodles were a huge relief.<br />
<figure id="attachment_4967" style="width: 384px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014HKP2-02.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-4967" alt="2014HKP2-02" src="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014HKP2-02-819x1024.jpg?resize=384%2C480" width="384" height="480" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">This dish saved a number of breakfast that trip. There just wasn&#8217;t much else to choose from.</figcaption></figure>
In addition, another thing I came to like in Hong Kong was a drink that was quite common there: tea with lemon and honey! And while that might sound extremely common place, it was rather odd for me to experience that in an Asian restaurant.<br />
<figure id="attachment_4968" style="width: 384px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014HKP2-03.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-4968" alt="2014HKP2-03" src="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014HKP2-03-768x1024.jpg?resize=384%2C512" width="384" height="512" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">They serve it hot or cold, but after trying both I found that I prefer the cold one.</figcaption></figure>
One place that was recommended by my friend Christine was this dim sum place. As you can see below, it was really crowded and hopping!<br />
<figure id="attachment_4969" style="width: 640px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014HKP2-04.jpg"><img class="size-large wp-image-4969" alt="2014HKP2-04" src="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014HKP2-04-1024x767.jpg?resize=640%2C479" width="640" height="479" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Look at all those people! You can imagine how long the wait for a table might have been. Haha.</figcaption></figure>
After waiting for a while though, we were finally seated and the dim sum feast began!<br />
<figure id="attachment_4970" style="width: 640px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014HKP2-05.jpg"><img class="size-large wp-image-4970" alt="2014HKP2-05" src="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014HKP2-05-1024x767.jpg?resize=640%2C479" width="640" height="479" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Ha Gao &#8211; Shrimp Dumplings &#8211; Excellent!</figcaption></figure>
<figure id="attachment_4971" style="width: 640px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014HKP2-06.jpg"><img class="size-large wp-image-4971" alt="2014HKP2-06" src="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014HKP2-06-1024x767.jpg?resize=640%2C479" width="640" height="479" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Xiu Mai &#8211; &#8220;Meatballs&#8221; &#8211; One of the best I&#8217;ve ever had. Very flavorful and it had great texture!</figcaption></figure>
<figure id="attachment_4972" style="width: 640px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014HKP2-07.jpg"><img class="size-large wp-image-4972" alt="2014HKP2-07" src="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014HKP2-07-1024x767.jpg?resize=640%2C479" width="640" height="479" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Can&#8217;t remember the name, but these were pretty good as well.</figcaption></figure>
<figure id="attachment_4973" style="width: 640px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014HKP2-08.jpg"><img class="size-large wp-image-4973" alt="2014HKP2-08" src="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014HKP2-08-1024x767.jpg?resize=640%2C479" width="640" height="479" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Sticky rice! A favorite of mine. It was pretty good, but we have comparable dishes in the US.</figcaption></figure>
<figure id="attachment_4974" style="width: 640px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014HKP2-09.jpg"><img class="size-large wp-image-4974" alt="2014HKP2-09" src="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014HKP2-09-1024x767.jpg?resize=640%2C479" width="640" height="479" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Roasted Pork Buns &#8211; These were the star of the entire meal. The outside of the bun was unlike anything I had ever had before. It was soo good!</figcaption></figure>
The next restaurant to be featured is a dessert place that was also near our hotel (we had gotten quite lucky to be around so many good food places within walking distance). We had passed by it a number of times walking around, but never went in because it was so crowded. One night however, it was just my dad and I and we decided to go ahead and see what the buzz was all about.<br />
<figure id="attachment_4975" style="width: 640px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014HKP2-10.jpg"><img class="size-large wp-image-4975" alt="2014HKP2-10" src="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014HKP2-10-1024x767.jpg?resize=640%2C479" width="640" height="479" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Xiao Fang Tang &#8211; The customer base was primarily the younger generation (i.e., teens to people in their twenties), and man it was crowded! It&#8217;s a pure dessert place and we had to wait to get in around like 7:00 o&#8217;clock for a party of 2. Crazy!</figcaption></figure>
<figure id="attachment_4976" style="width: 640px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014HKP2-11.jpg"><img class="size-large wp-image-4976" alt="2014HKP2-11" src="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014HKP2-11-768x1024.jpg?resize=640%2C853" width="640" height="853" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">This was the dessert I ordered. It&#8217;s served in a coconut! How cool is that?</figcaption></figure>
<figure id="attachment_4977" style="width: 640px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014HKP2-12.jpg"><img class="size-large wp-image-4977" alt="2014HKP2-12" src="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014HKP2-12-1024x859.jpg?resize=640%2C536" width="640" height="536" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Yum&#8230; It was full of random goodies inside accompanied by a sweet coconut milk and was just to die for. Haha. I have never had an Asian dessert like this. It was certainly a treat!</figcaption></figure>
<figure id="attachment_4978" style="width: 640px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014HKP2-13.jpg"><img class="size-large wp-image-4978" alt="2014HKP2-13" src="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014HKP2-13-1024x767.jpg?resize=640%2C479" width="640" height="479" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">This was the dessert my dad ordered. Durian and tapioca balls + other things. It was REALLY good. Although a fair warning, this place did smell strongly of durian, so durian haters steer clear!</figcaption></figure>
On the night I went to The Peak with my brother, we decided to grab ramen for dinner!<br />
<figure id="attachment_4979" style="width: 640px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014HKP2-14.jpg"><img class="size-large wp-image-4979" alt="2014HKP2-14" src="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014HKP2-14-768x1024.jpg?resize=640%2C853" width="640" height="853" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">The famous Ippudo! Except in Hong Kong!</figcaption></figure>
<figure id="attachment_4980" style="width: 640px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014HKP2-15.jpg"><img class="size-large wp-image-4980" alt="2014HKP2-15" src="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014HKP2-15-1024x767.jpg?resize=640%2C479" width="640" height="479" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">We ordered a popular appetizer from the NY location: Roasted Pork Buns! They were a great way to start the meal!</figcaption></figure>
<figure id="attachment_4981" style="width: 640px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014HKP2-16.jpg"><img class="size-large wp-image-4981" alt="2014HKP2-16" src="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014HKP2-16-1024x767.jpg?resize=640%2C479" width="640" height="479" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">And of course, how could I not have a picture of Ippudo&#8217;s delicious ramen. Just looking at it is making me want it again&#8230; Ahh!</figcaption></figure>
When we went to visit Tian Tan Buddha, we got a chance to try the temple&#8217;s vegetarian feast as well!<br />
<figure id="attachment_4982" style="width: 640px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014HKP2-17.jpg"><img class="size-large wp-image-4982" alt="2014HKP2-17" src="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014HKP2-17-1024x682.jpg?resize=640%2C426" width="640" height="426" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Here&#8217;s the entrance into the temple&#8217;s restaurant.</figcaption></figure>
<figure id="attachment_4983" style="width: 640px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014HKP2-18.jpg"><img class="size-large wp-image-4983" alt="2014HKP2-18" src="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014HKP2-18-1024x767.jpg?resize=640%2C479" width="640" height="479" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">This was a vegetarian soup that kind of reminded me of shark fin soup. It was really good!</figcaption></figure>
<figure id="attachment_4984" style="width: 640px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014HKP2-19.jpg"><img class="size-large wp-image-4984" alt="2014HKP2-19" src="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014HKP2-19-1024x767.jpg?resize=640%2C479" width="640" height="479" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Here&#8217;s an aerial shot of the entire feast. It was eight courses and consisted of really good vegetarian dishes. I won&#8217;t list them all, but it is suffice to say that any vegetarian (who like Asian food) would have enjoyed this feast!</figcaption></figure>
<figure id="attachment_4985" style="width: 640px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014HKP2-20.jpg"><img class="size-large wp-image-4985" alt="2014HKP2-20" src="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014HKP2-20-1024x767.jpg?resize=640%2C479" width="640" height="479" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Afterwards, we went to try the temple&#8217;s famous tofu dessert.</figcaption></figure>
<figure id="attachment_4986" style="width: 640px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014HKP2-21.jpg"><img class="size-large wp-image-4986" alt="2014HKP2-21" src="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014HKP2-21-1024x767.jpg?resize=640%2C479" width="640" height="479" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Here it is in all its glory. And while I know that many might wonder how tofu could be a dessert, trust me when I tell you that it totally works (think of it like jello). The sweet syrup with the tofu is just so delicious and hits just the right level of sweetness.</figcaption></figure>
<figure id="attachment_4987" style="width: 640px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014HKP2-22.jpg"><img class="size-large wp-image-4987" alt="2014HKP2-22" src="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014HKP2-22-768x1024.jpg?resize=640%2C853" width="640" height="853" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Though it might seem odd that I have McDonald featured here, I wanted to comment on how McCafe&#8217;s are actually really popular in Hong Kong and about as prevalent around the city as you would expect a Starbucks to be in a city in the US.</figcaption></figure>
<figure id="attachment_4988" style="width: 640px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014HKP2-23.jpg"><img class="size-large wp-image-4988" alt="2014HKP2-23" src="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014HKP2-23-1024x1022.jpg?resize=640%2C638" width="640" height="638" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">I didn&#8217;t actually try any of these things, but I thought that it was rather hilarious that instead of the apple pie being featured, it was totally &#8220;Asian-ified&#8221; and they were selling red bean pie (upper right corner).</figcaption></figure>
<figure id="attachment_4989" style="width: 640px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014HKP2-24.jpg"><img class="size-large wp-image-4989" alt="2014HKP2-24" src="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014HKP2-24-1024x767.jpg?resize=640%2C479" width="640" height="479" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">This here is a regular milk tea from the McCafe with the Chinese character for tea sprinkled over the foam with Himalayan spice. It was actually surprisingly good when you consider the fact it was from McDonalds! Haha.</figcaption></figure>
Another fun thing I got to try in Hong Kong was cream soda (depicted below). I know that this might be a regular occurrence to some in the States, but my aunt told me she grew up drinking it so I decided to give it a shot. It was a new flavor and quite an interesting taste! Not something I could drink all the time, but I could see why people really enjoy it.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014HKP2-25.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-4990" alt="2014HKP2-25" src="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014HKP2-25-768x1024.jpg?resize=384%2C512" width="384" height="512" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"> Another thing about Hong Kong is that the airport is HUGE. And maybe I&#8217;m just ignorant from having only really spent time in airports in the United States, but there was just so many food options (that were actually good)! For instance, this place (below) featured an entree not found in many other places.</p>

Definitely a unique dish. It&#8217;s one I would recommend to people who like eating duck. Otherwise, probably want to steer clear.</figcaption></figure>
And of course, while at the airport, I also took the chance to grab me some milk tea whenever I had the chance!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014HKP2-28.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-4993" alt="2014HKP2-28" src="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014HKP2-28-768x1024.jpg?resize=384%2C512" width="384" height="512" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">And on the last day, I even got a chance to try the ramen at the airport. I have to say that I was a little skeptical of how good it could be. After all, it was in an airport. It can&#8217;t be that authentic right?</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014HKP2-29.jpg"><img class="size-large wp-image-4994 aligncenter" alt="2014HKP2-29" src="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014HKP2-29-1024x767.jpg?resize=640%2C479" width="640" height="479" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Yeah I was completely wrong. For airport standards, this ramen was awesome if you needed some real food before going to the terminal!</p>

As always, I have saved the best for last. On one night, my family and I were very fortunate to be able to [partake in an incredible experience at a restaurant called Imasa. It was by reservation only (which my cousin was able to get for us on short notice) where their buffet was $100 USD per person.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014HKP2-35.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-5001" alt="2014HKP2-35" src="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014HKP2-35-1024x767.jpg?resize=640%2C479" width="640" height="479" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Yep&#8230; That&#8217;s right. $100 USD per person. And even though the price seemed outrageous to me at the time, what I will say is that it was worth every penny. I have never had food that was elevated to such a level I&#8217;d never experienced before. Anyhow, more on that later&#8230;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">To begin, we start with the setting of the table for every person. As you can see, there&#8217;s a small thing of wasabi, a place to rest your chopsticks and soup spoon so they don&#8217;t have to touch the table, a hot towel, and a cup of tea that never went empty because they always refilled it after you drank about 30% of it.</p>

To clarify real quick before progressing, while this was a buffet in the traditional sense, they also featured special entrees that were limited to one per person due to the extremely high quality dish they were serving you (i.e., <a title="Wagyu Wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wagyu">Wagyu beef</a>).<br />
Now we begin the tour of the buffet bar&#8230;<br />

When I had that first bite of sashimi, I have to tell you that it was literally out of this world. I am a huge sushi fan and had my fair share of sashimi, but I had never had anything so incredible before. The fish just tasted so sweet and fresh while being so incredibly tender and practically melting in your mouth. In fact, even things like squid sashimi (which I despise to eat here in the US because of how rubbery it normally is) was actually enjoyable!<br />
<figure id="attachment_5018" style="width: 640px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014HKP2-52.jpg"><img class="size-large wp-image-5018" alt="2014HKP2-52" src="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014HKP2-52-1024x767.jpg?resize=640%2C479" width="640" height="479" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">My second plate with assorted sashimi and sushi!</figcaption></figure>
Some of the new delicacies I got to try here was &#8220;sweet shrimp&#8221; and &#8220;scallops&#8221; sashimi. I had never had shrimp or scallop raw before, but like I mentioned earlier, the freshness of these ingredients were so incredible that I just couldn&#8217;t get enough!<br />
<figure id="attachment_5019" style="width: 640px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014HKP2-53.jpg"><img class="size-large wp-image-5019" alt="2014HKP2-53" src="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014HKP2-53-1024x767.jpg?resize=640%2C479" width="640" height="479" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Here&#8217;s umami over a cucumber!</figcaption></figure>
Even things like umami (i.e., sea urchin) which I normally don&#8217;t care for was actually quite savory and tasty!<br />
<figure id="attachment_5020" style="width: 640px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014HKP2-54.jpg"><img class="size-large wp-image-5020" alt="2014HKP2-54" src="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014HKP2-54-1024x767.jpg?resize=640%2C479" width="640" height="479" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Dried puffer fish jerky &#8211; It was really tasty! Couldn&#8217;t get enough of it!</figcaption></figure>
And to top it off, because we were with my cousin, we got to try this special dish (that wasn&#8217;t part of the buffet and had to be ordered separately) which many of you probably know about: the puffer fish! Now while it wasn&#8217;t raw (which would then run the risk of me dying from eating it), it was awesome to be able to get to try the actual fish itself.<br />
As you&#8217;ll see over the next few photos, I go back quite a bit to keep getting different things and see what new flavors and tastes the restaurant had waiting for me. Time and time it continued to surprise me with things that I thought I wouldn&#8217;t like and ending up enjoying.</p>

Now we enter into the main entrees that was featured on the second page of the menu. You&#8217;ll notice I have shots of every single entree (even though it&#8217;s limit to one per person), but because my cousin was a frequent visitor there, we were able to get as many as we wanted.<br />
<figure id="attachment_5026" style="width: 640px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014HKP2-60.jpg"><img class="size-large wp-image-5026" alt="2014HKP2-60" src="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014HKP2-60-1024x767.jpg?resize=640%2C479" width="640" height="479" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Tuban shell teppanyaki</figcaption></figure>
<figure id="attachment_5027" style="width: 640px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014HKP2-61.jpg"><img class="size-large wp-image-5027" alt="2014HKP2-61" src="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014HKP2-61-1024x767.jpg?resize=640%2C479" width="640" height="479" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Grilled kinki fish with salt</figcaption></figure>
<figure id="attachment_5028" style="width: 640px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014HKP2-62.jpg"><img class="size-large wp-image-5028" alt="2014HKP2-62" src="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014HKP2-62-1024x767.jpg?resize=640%2C479" width="640" height="479" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Wagyu beef noodle soup</figcaption></figure>
<p style="text-align: center;">When I had that first bite of Wagyu beef, all I will say is that this was another one of those out of the world experiences. I have enjoyed my fair share of beef, steak and so forth, but the tenderness and flavor of the meat was simply mind blowing. I was practically speechless&#8230;</p>
<figure id="attachment_5029" style="width: 640px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014HKP2-63.jpg"><img class="size-large wp-image-5029" alt="2014HKP2-63" src="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014HKP2-63-1024x767.jpg?resize=640%2C479" width="640" height="479" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Red bean ice cream and hokkaido ice cream</figcaption></figure>
Now that we&#8217;ve started the dessert section, I have to also pay another tribute to the ice cream above. While ice cream is one of those common place desserts, I will have to say that red bean is just one of those things I have never liked growing up. Yet, to my surprise, I LOVED what they did with this ice cream and just couldn&#8217;t get enough (I even ordered a second one later on). Hahaha.<br />
<figure id="attachment_5030" style="width: 640px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014HKP2-64.jpg"><img class="size-large wp-image-5030" alt="2014HKP2-64" src="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014HKP2-64-1024x767.jpg?resize=640%2C479" width="640" height="479" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">As you can see here, I tried to jam my entire plate with everything I could grab from the dessert table. I don&#8217;t think there was anything I ate that was disappointing.</figcaption></figure>
<figure id="attachment_5031" style="width: 640px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014HKP2-65.jpg"><img class="size-large wp-image-5031" alt="2014HKP2-65" src="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014HKP2-65-1024x767.jpg?resize=640%2C479" width="640" height="479" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Finally, we had this pudding/jello dessert. And if you&#8217;re wondering what that gold leaf is on top, that isn&#8217;t just decoration. That&#8217;s actual gold! Talk about decadent!</figcaption></figure>
To be honest, I always thought that 5 star restaurants and such were just hyper-inflated prices of what people normally eat; but this restaurant certainly opened my eyes (and taste buds) to just how vastly deep the world of food can be. Sure, sometimes &#8220;5 star restaurants&#8221; are simply overpriced, but if you can find a gem like the one I got to try here, you might see (and taste) what I mean one day.<br />
Well, I hope that you enjoyed the small glimpse of my food adventures in Hong Kong. I was originally going to post everything that I had eaten, but it was something like 150+ photos and I knew it wasn&#8217;t realistic for me to try to fit that all in one post. So what you got to read above were the highlights of my adventure that I felt was worth your time.<br />
And tomorrow, the long wait is finally over, we conclude my Hong Kong trip series with my visit to the Hong Kong Go Association!</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Introduction</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">After much waiting and anticipation, I&#8217;m happy to finally release my Hong Kong post series! I originally had plans to do a day by day retelling of my adventures in Hong Kong, but I realized that it would take way too long to write and not to mention I would probably bore you to tears.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">In addition, since the trip wasn&#8217;t entirely centered on go, I wanted to capture as much of my trip as possible without taking too much time away from the main subject matter of this blog: go.  After all, as I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;ve noticed, I&#8217;ve worked hard to ensure that all my posts have always been related to go. So I hope you&#8217;ll forgive me for detracting from go these next couple of days to tell you about my trip. With that said, I hope you enjoy these posts!</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Part 1 &#8211; The Scenery</h2>
<p>The trip was a 13+ hour flight, so you can imagine our delight when we were finally off the plane and stepping foot into Hong Kong for the first time. After going through customs, getting our luggage, and a brief encounter of a taxi driver trying to hustle and get our family to take his taxi back to the city as opposed to the bus, we soon found ourselves on a bus driving down into the city.<br />
After about thirty minutes, we were driving through the city and I was greeted by the following view of Hong Kong for the first time:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014HKP1-01.jpg"><img class="size-large wp-image-4917 aligncenter" src="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014HKP1-01-1024x682.jpg?resize=640%2C426" alt="2014HKP1-01" width="640" height="426" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span id="more-4916"></span>Considering this is the first time my family and I have ever been to Hong Kong, it should be no surprise to you that we did a lot of exploring of the city. And even though I&#8217;ve been to my fair share of cities (i.e., Washington D.C., New York, Los Angeles, San Francisco), I have to say that Hong Kong was full of tall buildings.<br />
<figure id="attachment_4918" style="width: 384px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014HKP1-02.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-4918" src="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014HKP1-02-768x1024.jpg?resize=384%2C512" alt="2014HKP1-02" width="384" height="512" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">This building was so tall that I only managed to capture it using panoramic mode.</figcaption></figure>
And while one expect a city to be full of buildings, I couldn&#8217;t help but notice that Hong Kong had a lot of unique building designs sprinkled throughout as you would walk from place to place.<br />
<figure id="attachment_4919" style="width: 384px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014HKP1-03.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-4919" src="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014HKP1-03-768x1024.jpg?resize=384%2C512" alt="2014HKP1-03" width="384" height="512" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">The building on the left captured my attention for this shot. Isn&#8217;t it neat?</figcaption></figure>
One of the things that my brother wanted to do was visit The Peak (aka <a title="Victoria Peak Wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victoria_Peak">Victoria Peak</a> &#8211; which is a tourist location because it&#8217;s the tallest point in Hong Kong where you can see the entire city). So one night we decided to head up on our own (which was a fun adventure since neither of us spoke Cantonese), and after getting lost and nearly leaving the location (we thought we were in the wrong place but we were really just in the wrong building), we finally found ourselves at the right spot.<br />
<figure id="attachment_4920" style="width: 640px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014HKP1-04.jpg"><img class="size-large wp-image-4920" src="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014HKP1-04-1024x682.jpg?resize=640%2C426" alt="2014HKP1-04" width="640" height="426" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">For anyone coming to visit Victoria Peak, this is the building you&#8217;re looking for when you have the taxi take you up there. It is NOT the shopping mall that you first find yourself at when the taxi drops you at. Haha.</figcaption></figure>
My night photography skills need a lot of work, but here&#8217;s a semi-decent shot that I managed to get of the incredible view we had at the top.<br />
<figure id="attachment_4921" style="width: 640px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014HKP1-05.jpg"><img class="size-large wp-image-4921" src="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014HKP1-05-1024x682.jpg?resize=640%2C426" alt="2014HKP1-05" width="640" height="426" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Imagine that in real life&#8230; Although I will say that when I was leaning over the edge to take the picture, I looked down and my stomach immediately knotted up as I thought about what it would be like to fall down or drop my camera&#8230; *shudders*</figcaption></figure>
<figure id="attachment_4922" style="width: 640px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014HKP1-06.jpg"><img class="size-large wp-image-4922" src="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014HKP1-06-1024x682.jpg?resize=640%2C426" alt="2014HKP1-06" width="640" height="426" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Here&#8217;s a photo of my brother (on the left) and me (on the right).</figcaption></figure>
Another memorable aspect about Hong Kong is the fact that construction is going on EVERYWHERE. I swear, I don&#8217;t think I can recall a single time where I wasn&#8217;t walking down a street and not seeing some kind of construction going on. And to make it an even more memorable fact, a lot of the construction was done using bamboo structures to provide support.<br />
<figure id="attachment_4923" style="width: 640px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014HKP1-07.jpg"><img class="size-large wp-image-4923" src="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014HKP1-07-1024x767.jpg?resize=640%2C479" alt="2014HKP1-07" width="640" height="479" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Here&#8217;s a shot of the bamboo structures I was talking about. Though I&#8217;m aware of how strong bamboo can be, it was crazy seeing it being used as such a critical support structure for construction.</figcaption></figure>
Another thing that I noticed about Hong Kong is that while it lives up to what you expect of a city in terms of things being open late, everything that we went to in the morning (like shopping malls and such) were closed!!! In other words, it seems that the better approach for life in Hong Kong is to stay out real late, sleep-in, grab lunch, and then go out to do stuff. Haha.<br />
<figure id="attachment_4924" style="width: 640px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014HKP1-08.jpg"><img class="size-large wp-image-4924" src="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014HKP1-08-1024x767.jpg?resize=640%2C479" alt="2014HKP1-08" width="640" height="479" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">This was taken at a prominent mall called &#8220;The One.&#8221; It was like 11AM. Pretty much everything was closed&#8230; &gt;_&lt;</figcaption></figure>
After having gone to Times Square in New York, I have to say that I wasn&#8217;t expecting to be wowed by any LED lights or big fancy screens in Hong Kong; but I noticed some really gorgeous designs of Chinese characters shining brightly with LED lights.<br />
<figure id="attachment_4925" style="width: 384px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014HKP1-09.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-4925" src="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014HKP1-09-768x1024.jpg?resize=384%2C512" alt="2014HKP1-09" width="384" height="512" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">This is the Chinese character for &#8220;medicine.&#8221; As you can see, the calligraphy looks gorgeous even though it&#8217;s comprised of LED lights.</figcaption></figure>
The other big tourist thing my family and I did was to visit the <a title="Tian Tan Buddha Wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tian_Tan_Buddha">Tian Tan Buddha</a>. It was a bit of a journey to get up there; but after two long bus rides, we finally arrived.<br />
<figure id="attachment_4926" style="width: 640px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014HKP1-10.jpg"><img class="size-large wp-image-4926" src="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014HKP1-10-1024x682.jpg?resize=640%2C426" alt="2014HKP1-10" width="640" height="426" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">This was the view I was greeted with when we got off the bus.</figcaption></figure>
<figure id="attachment_4927" style="width: 640px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014HKP1-11.jpg"><img class="size-large wp-image-4927" src="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014HKP1-11-1024x682.jpg?resize=640%2C426" alt="2014HKP1-11" width="640" height="426" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">When you are about to enter, you are greeted with this majestic white gate.</figcaption></figure>
After walking in, we were taking in the sights and then promptly noticed two dogs that were just relaxing in the sun. The atmosphere was already very calming and zen-like to begin with, but seeing these dogs just made it that much more so.<br />
<figure id="attachment_4928" style="width: 640px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014HKP1-12.jpg"><img class="size-large wp-image-4928" src="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014HKP1-12-1024x682.jpg?resize=640%2C426" alt="2014HKP1-12" width="640" height="426" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">This dog was just taking a nap in the middle of the central area without a care in the world. Doesn&#8217;t he look so peaceful?</figcaption></figure>
<figure id="attachment_4929" style="width: 640px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014HKP1-13.jpg"><img class="size-large wp-image-4929" src="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014HKP1-13-1024x682.jpg?resize=640%2C426" alt="2014HKP1-13" width="640" height="426" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">This dog was just chilling on the front steps and peering out as if calmly observing everything going around him.</figcaption></figure>
Before we headed up the long stairs to the Buddha statue, I experimented with my camera a bit.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014HKP1-14.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-4930" src="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014HKP1-14-1024x682.jpg?resize=640%2C426" alt="2014HKP1-14" width="640" height="426" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014HKP1-15.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-4931" src="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014HKP1-15-1024x682.jpg?resize=640%2C426" alt="2014HKP1-15" width="640" height="426" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">After a long trek up multiple flights of stairs, we were finally greeted by the immense statue of Tian Tan Buddha.</p>
<figure id="attachment_4932" style="width: 640px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014HKP1-16.jpg"><img class="size-large wp-image-4932" src="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014HKP1-16-1024x682.jpg?resize=640%2C426" alt="2014HKP1-16" width="640" height="426" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">It&#8217;s so big!!!!</figcaption></figure>
After walking around and going in to the museum (which I am unfortunately unable to feature on this post since no photography was allowed), I had a chance to explore around the area on my own for a bit and took a couple of shots.<br />
<figure id="attachment_4933" style="width: 640px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014HKP1-17.jpg"><img class="size-large wp-image-4933" src="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014HKP1-17-1024x682.jpg?resize=640%2C426" alt="2014HKP1-17" width="640" height="426" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">This was taken from the side of the Buddha looking out into the open. Doesn&#8217;t it look so serene?</figcaption></figure>
<figure id="attachment_4934" style="width: 640px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014HKP1-18.jpg"><img class="size-large wp-image-4934" src="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014HKP1-18-1024x682.jpg?resize=640%2C426" alt="2014HKP1-18" width="640" height="426" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Here&#8217;s a favorite of mine from the side of the Buddha statue.</figcaption></figure>

Once we had finished visiting the Buddha statue, we went to visit the rest of the temple and see what else was in the area.<br />

While Hong Kong was not a huge culture shock to me in regards to living standards (i.e., not much different from what you&#8217;d expect after living in the U.S.), it was still a magnificent cultural experience. And even though I was in Hong Kong for about 10 days, I still feel as if I&#8217;ve only experienced and saw only a fraction of what it had to offer.<br />
I hope that this post offered you a glimpse into the wonders that Hong Kong has to offer, but don&#8217;t worry, our journey is not yet done. Tomorrow I have a rather scrumptious post for you, so get your salivating glands ready!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I know that it&#8217;s been over a week since I came back from Hong Kong, so first off, I apologize that I haven&#8217;t been able to post about Hong Kong yet.<br />
When I got back, I thought that I would be able to just grab my photos and quickly organize them in an hour or so. And then after I did that, I would be able to start working on my posts. After all, it&#8217;s only about a week&#8217;s worth of pictures right?<br />
<a href="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/03/47766415.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4854" alt="47766415" src="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/03/47766415.jpg?resize=400%2C400" width="400" height="400" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><br />
Yeah&#8230; Let&#8217;s just say I completely forgot and therefore underestimated the amount of effort it takes to properly organize your photos (and that doesn&#8217;t even count editing, cropping, resizing, etc.). There were the duplicates, the variations on a shot that I had to choose through, and then renaming them properly so I can easily track what is what&#8230;<br />
So while I thought I would be able to knock it out quickly so I could get started on drafting my Hong Kong trip posts, it&#8217;ll probably be at least another week before I&#8217;m able to get them up and online. Because in the end, I&#8217;m not trying to just throw up posts for the sake of posting. I&#8217;m really trying to capture the experience as best I can in order to give you the most enjoyable reading experience possible, so I hope you can bear with me a bit longer.<br />
On a separate but related note, I am also starting to feel the twinge of anxiety as I&#8217;m starting to fall slightly my weekly posts. As I&#8217;ve been trying to improve the quality of the game reviews, they&#8217;ve also started to take a considerable amount of time. But don&#8217;t worry, I&#8217;m working hard to make sure that I don&#8217;t fall behind. Back to work I go!</p>
