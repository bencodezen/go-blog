<h3>Detailed Review</h3>
<p>This was my first set of real go equipment. When it arrived, I was happier than a child on a shopping spree at a toy store. And so, you can imagine how happy I was to see that my order was packaged very well. Here are some shots of the package:<br />
<a href="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2013/03/gosetbox.jpg"><img class="aligncenter" alt="gosetbox" src="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2013/03/gosetbox.jpg?resize=300%2C225" width="300" height="225" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><br />
<figure id="attachment_2402" style="width: 300px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2013/03/gosetbox2.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2402" alt="gosetbox2" src="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2013/03/gosetbox2.jpg?resize=300%2C225" width="300" height="225" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">As you can see, the contents inside are very well protected.</figcaption></figure>
Everything arrived in great condition. The only issue I had was that some of the black stones were missing from the set. So I contacted <a href="http://www.ymimports.com/">YMImports</a> that very day, and received a response within 12 hours notifying me that they would send replacement stones. Way to live up to your reputation of great customer service <a href="https://www.ymimports.com/">YMImports</a>!<br />
In order to streamline the review, the different parts have been separated into their own individual reviews. You can find them at the following links:</p>

<li><a title="Equipment Review: Yunzi Biconvex Stones Set" href="//equipment-review-yunzi-biconvex-stones-set/">Biconvex Yunzi Stones (Size 33)</a></li>
<li><a title="Equipment Review: Kitani Jujube Bowls" href="//equipment-review-kitani-jujube-bowls/">Kitani Style Jujube Bowls</a></li>
<li><a title="Equipment Review: Go Stones and Bowls Carrying Bag" href="//equipment-review-go-stones-and-bowls-carrying-bag/">Go Stones and Bowls Carrying Bag</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The set as a whole is an incredible value. Unless you are looking to specifically buy a floor board, portable board, or another kind of stone (e.g., slate and shell), this the best deal that you&#8217;re going to find.</p>

<h3>Detailed Review*</h3>
<p>When purchasing my first go set, this was by far the most anticipated piece of equipment. After all, the prospect of playing with real stones and making the aesthetic sound as you play each move was so exciting! However, I digress, here is what the package looked like when it came in. As with all other items I&#8217;ve received from <a href="http://www.ymimports.com/">Yellow Mountain Imports</a>, everything was packaged and protected very well.<br />
<figure id="attachment_2351" style="width: 300px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2010/09/yunziset.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2351" alt="Top layer of styrofoam (not in picture)" src="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2010/09/yunziset.jpg?resize=300%2C225" width="300" height="225" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Top layer of styrofoam (not in picture)</figcaption></figure>
When you open the bag, here&#8217;s what you see.<br />
<a href="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2010/09/yunziset03.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2353" alt="yunziset03" src="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2010/09/yunziset03.jpg?resize=300%2C225" width="300" height="225" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><br />
<a href="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2010/09/yunziset04.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2354" alt="yunziset04" src="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2010/09/yunziset04.jpg?resize=300%2C225" width="300" height="225" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><br />
For those who are have never purchased yunzi before, they do not come all fresh and shiny when you receive them. The stones come with a white powder coat in order to protect from damage during shipment.<br />
<figure id="attachment_2355" style="width: 300px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2010/09/biconvex33yunzi.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2355" alt="biconvex33yunzi" src="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2010/09/biconvex33yunzi.jpg?resize=300%2C225" width="300" height="225" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Yunzi Stones Before Cleaning</figcaption></figure>
<figure id="attachment_2356" style="width: 300px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2010/09/biconvex33yunzi02.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2356" alt="Yunzi Stones After Cleaning" src="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2010/09/biconvex33yunzi02.jpg?resize=300%2C225" width="300" height="225" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Yunzi Stones After Cleaning</figcaption></figure>
Although it requires a bit of elbow grease and time to get them shined up and ready to go, I personally found the process very enjoyable and rewarding. It&#8217;s hard to say what it is exactly, but there&#8217;s just something about personally taking care of your stones that makes your stones that much more enjoyable to use. For those who are curious as to what the process is for cleaning yunzi stones, visit <a title="How to Oil Your Yunzi Stones" href="//how-to-oil-your-yunzi-stones/">my guide</a> for more information.<br />
<strong>Size &amp; Weight:</strong> The stones have a solid weight to them that gives a great feeling when picking each one up and placing it on the board. They fit very well on the Shin-Kaya Board that I purchased, but keep in mind that each  board is unique in what their max stone size is.<br />
<strong>Durability:</strong> I have not found durability to be an issue. Granted, I have not tried taking a sledgehammer to them, but I think it could survive anything short of that.<br />
<strong>Usability:</strong> This set is a fantastic all in one package. Great for leaving at home or bringing with you to the local coffee shop.<br />
If you&#8217;re in the market for biconvex stones, this is the set for you.** The bag carries the stones pretty well. The bowls are freaking awesome. And I love the feel of real stones in my hands. Though the price may seem a little high, you are buying a quality set that has so much value and will last a long time.<br />
*<em>Since most people are probably more interested in the stones, I have separated out the bowls and bag review to prevent the review from being overcluttered. You can find the reviews at the following links: <a title="Equipment Review: Kitani Jujube Bowls" href="//equipment-review-kitani-jujube-bowls/">Kitani Jujube Bowls</a> &amp; <a title="Equipment Review: Go Stones and Bowls Carrying Bag" href="//equipment-review-go-stones-and-bowls-carrying-bag/">Go Stones and Bowls Carrying Bag</a>.</em><br />
