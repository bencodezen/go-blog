<h2 style="text-align: center;">Folding Wooden Go Board</h2>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Over­all Rat­ing: 8 / 10 Ponnuki</h2>
<h3>High­lights</h3>
<ul>
<li>Great portable board considering I got it for around $10.</li>
<li>The lines are not drawn the best, but it does the job and is worth the purchase.</li>
<li>Let me know if you find this anywhere online, since the local store doesn&#8217;t sell it anymore.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Prod­uct Details</h3>
<ul>
<li>One folding Go Board (19&#215;19).</li>
<li>Measures 18-1/4&#8243;L x 17&#8243;W x 3-3/4&#8243;H (46.5cm x 43cm x 9.7cm).</li>
<li>Board is 1-1/2&#8243; (4cm) thick.</li>
</ul>
<p><span id="more-76"></span></p>
<h3>Detailed Review</h3>
<p><strong>Size &amp; Weight:</strong> For it&#8217;s portability, the size actually is quite nice since it fits in my 14 inch laptop messenger bag. It&#8217;s light compared to any other table board you might buy.<br />
<strong>Dura­bil­ity:</strong> It holds up very well and very reliable in transit. I&#8217;ve carried it a number of times and never worried about dings or scratches that might ruin the board.<br />
<strong>Usabil­ity:</strong> The sound that the board makes from stones hitting it are not nearly as fulfilling as one might get from a shin-kaya board, but it really fits the bill when you&#8217;re looking for an easy to transport go board.<br />
Although the local store does not sell it anymore, this product is definitely worth buying if you ever see one. In fact, the moment anyone finds a place that sells it, be sure to let me know!</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Overall Rating: 10 /10 Ponnuki</h2>
<h3>Highlights</h3>

<h3>Detailed Review</h3>
<p>This was my first set of real go equipment. When it arrived, I was happier than a child on a shopping spree at a toy store. And so, you can imagine how happy I was to see that my order was packaged very well. Here are some shots of the package:<br />
<a href="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2013/03/gosetbox.jpg"><img class="aligncenter" alt="gosetbox" src="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2013/03/gosetbox.jpg?resize=300%2C225" width="300" height="225" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><br />
<figure id="attachment_2402" style="width: 300px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2013/03/gosetbox2.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2402" alt="gosetbox2" src="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2013/03/gosetbox2.jpg?resize=300%2C225" width="300" height="225" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">As you can see, the contents inside are very well protected.</figcaption></figure>
Everything arrived in great condition. The only issue I had was that some of the black stones were missing from the set. So I contacted <a href="http://www.ymimports.com/">YMImports</a> that very day, and received a response within 12 hours notifying me that they would send replacement stones. Way to live up to your reputation of great customer service <a href="https://www.ymimports.com/">YMImports</a>!<br />
In order to streamline the review, the different parts have been separated into their own individual reviews. You can find them at the following links:</p>
<ul>

<li><a title="Equipment Review: Yunzi Biconvex Stones Set" href="//equipment-review-yunzi-biconvex-stones-set/">Biconvex Yunzi Stones (Size 33)</a></li>
<li><a title="Equipment Review: Kitani Jujube Bowls" href="//equipment-review-kitani-jujube-bowls/">Kitani Style Jujube Bowls</a></li>
<li><a title="Equipment Review: Go Stones and Bowls Carrying Bag" href="//equipment-review-go-stones-and-bowls-carrying-bag/">Go Stones and Bowls Carrying Bag</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The set as a whole is an incredible value. Unless you are looking to specifically buy a floor board, portable board, or another kind of stone (e.g., slate and shell), this the best deal that you&#8217;re going to find.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Shin-Kaya &#8211; 1-1/2&#8243; (4 cm) Go Floor / Table Board</h2>
<h2 style="text-align: center;"> Overall Rating: 10 / 10 Ponnuki</h2>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">Highlights</h3>
<ul>
<li><span style="line-height: 13px;">Legs are removable, which allows the board to function as both a floor and table board.</span></li>
<li>The floor height is not nearly as high as the standard floor board, but it is pretty good for the price and quality of the board.</li>
<li>This is a good board that is more suited for staying at the house and not quite suitable for bringing to a coffee shop to review a pro game.</li>
<li>Stones that measure 9.2mm (Size 33) fit comfortably on the board. Any size larger maybe a bit of a squeeze.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Product Details</h3>
<ul>
<li>One 2-3/8&#8243; (6cm) thick Tibet Spruce (Shin-Kaya) wood board [including feet].</li>
<li>Made of 2-4 solid pieces of wood joined together to prevent warping over time.</li>
<li>Measures 18-1/4&#8243;L x 17&#8243;W x 3-3/4&#8243;H (46.5cm x 43cm x 9.7cm)</li>

<h3 style="text-align: left;">Detailed Review</h3>
<p>As this was my first legitimate go board (aka goban), I was incredibly excited the day it arrived on my doorstep. To add to my excitement, I was delighted to find out that everything was packaged extremely well. To prove my point, look at the how well protected the board is!<br />
<figure id="attachment_2314" style="width: 300px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2010/09/4skb1.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2314" alt="4skb1" src="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2010/09/4skb1.jpg?resize=300%2C225" width="300" height="225" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Top layer of styrofoam (not in picture)</figcaption></figure>
Here are the contents of the order in its entirety.<br />
<figure id="attachment_2319" style="width: 300px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2010/09/4skb2.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2319" alt="Board + Information Pamphlet + Introduction to Go Brochure" src="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2010/09/4skb2.jpg?resize=300%2C225" width="300" height="225" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Board + Info Pamphlet + Intro to Go Brochure</figcaption></figure>
<strong>Size &amp; Weight:</strong> The board has a nice weight to it that feels extremely solid. In terms of portability however, it&#8217;s not something that I would recommend trying to carry around. In other words, this is a board that is perfect as an &#8220;at home&#8221; type of goban.<br />
<strong>Durability:</strong> I have had it now for more than two years and found that the board holds up very well. Like any other wood product however, be very careful in regards to dropping objects on it since it will scratch and leave dents. Otherwise, I have played many stones on it and have not seen any blemishes or fading as a result.<br />
<strong>Functionality:</strong> Now the best part about this board is that the legs are removable, so it doubles as a great solid table board while also giving you the option of using it as a floor board. For those who cry blasphemy at the idea of calling it a floor board, I know that it&#8217;s full height of 6 cm does not compare to the typical height of 15-21 cm; but considering the price tag of $60 versus the average $400+ floor board, I think it does a great job.<br />
Before I conclude, I want to address the two types of buyers that I would not recommend this board for:</p>
<ol>
<li><span style="line-height: 13px;"><strong>&#8220;I want a floor board like the one in Hikaru has.&#8221;</strong> &#8211; This is absolutely not the product for you. I have not purchased one yet, but they are rather expensive ($400 minimum for a decent quality one from my research) and not as readily available. If I ever buy one, I will be sure to update this section with my review.</span></li>
<li><strong>&#8220;I need a board that is easy to store away / portable.&#8221;</strong> &#8211; This board is a little too big and thick to be stuffing away in a corner or bookshelf somewhere inconspicuously. Instead, I would recommend looking for a foldable board or a thinner one if at all possible. (<em>Reviews for these types of products will be added in the near future</em>).</li>
</ol>
<p>Otherwise, if you&#8217;re in the market for a quality go board for a great price that can double as a floor and table board, this is the one for you.</p>
