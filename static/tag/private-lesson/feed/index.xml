So I had my second private lesson today, and I have to say I felt like such an idiot as we were going over my games. It&#8217;s funny how blatantly obvious my idiotic decisions and rationales are when pointed out. I&#8217;m still falling into the typical traps of a new player (e.g. focusing on local areas, having no purpose, wishful thinking, etc.) Argh&#8230;. I think I&#8217;m going to have to come up with a handout for beginning Go players to look over once a day to help them out.<br />
One of the most critical aha moments that went off in my head today is the fact that I don&#8217;t and can&#8217;t quite read ahead worth crap. It&#8217;s definitely one of the reasons that I make the poor plays that I do. This is probably one of the reasons I hate half of the books that I&#8217;ve reviewed so far. They have so many complicated diagrams, but in reality there is probably more substance since they are probably assuming you can read it out in your head no problem. So far, I&#8217;ve been actually replaying variations on an actual board. This is useful to an extent, but I have to be able to play the simulations out in my head.<br />
As I mentioned at the beginning of this month, I&#8217;m trying to break the double digit kyu (DDK) by October 8th. It probably is near impossible to do so, but here&#8217;s my crazy game plan:</p>
<ol>
<li>Finish the following books:
<ul>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Opening Theory Made Easy</span> by Otake Hideo 9 dan</li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Whole Board Thinking in Joseki &#8211; Volume One</span> by Yi-Lun Yang</li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">One Thousand and One Life-and-Death Problems</span> by Richard Bozulich</li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Understanding Dan Level Play</span> by Yuan Zhou</li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Tesuji</span> by James Davies</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Replay 25 moves of a professional game (that has commentary) everyday.</li>
<li>Play one serious game (not a bot) everyday where I don&#8217;t rush and try my hardest.</li>
</ol>
<p>It&#8217;s like my teacher said, &#8220;It&#8217;s not hard to rise levels at the stage you&#8217;re at, you just have to stop doing all these irrational and inefficient moves.&#8221; Time to topple over these obstacles.
