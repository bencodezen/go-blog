Here&#8217;s a game that I wanted to put in my article on <a title="Bad vs. Wrong Decisions" href="//bad-vs-wrong-decisions/" target="_blank">Bad vs. Wrong Decisions</a>. Although this was a game against a 14k (I was 13k at the time), I gave it my all and I must say it was quite a match. (I&#8217;m white)So this is something I&#8217;ve definitely noticed. For some reason, there seems to exist this seemingly large gap between those who are SDK and those who are DDK. Now I know you&#8217;re probably like, imagine the gap between SDK and amateur dan, and then the gap between amateur dan and professionals! Trust me, I was quite aware of the barriers awaiting me when I began learning this game. It&#8217;s definitely interesting though, the way SDK&#8217;s play vs. DDK&#8217;s. At this point, if I&#8217;m matched up to a DDK, I think I&#8217;m in pretty solid shape. On the other hand&#8230; it doesn&#8217;t seem like I&#8217;m quite ready to take on an SDK yet (even game that is). I played an SDK last night in person, and lost by ~13 points even though I had a 3 stone handicap&#8230; bleh&#8230;. When I figure out where that gap is though, I&#8217;ll be sure to let you know.<br />
