				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hey everyone. Sabbatical over. It&#8217;s time I returned to the game. For all those who have been keeping up with my progress, I have virtually been absent from playing any serious games.  I think the only two online games I have logged online are against the 30k computer. xD<br />
That being said, no idea what my strength is anymore.  Maybe the time away has let me grow, or maybe get weaker.  More people probably believe weaker, but I dunno if I necessarily agree.  I&#8217;ll be approaching this game a whole new way this time.  I was studying it as if it were going to be my career at first, but the sabbatical really helped me to get perspective on my own &#8220;whole board thinking.&#8221;<br />
The rest of this month will serve as my beta testing for my plan, but this is what I&#8217;m looking at.</p>
<ol>
<li>Serious games per week: 3 games per week</li>
<li>Study method: Review and study a little bit during each weekday.</li>
</ol>
<div>That&#8217;s it? Yup. The key thing for this plan is consistency.  I&#8217;m in no rush to get to the dan level. It&#8217;ll come when it&#8217;s time. Meanwhile, watch your back SDK&#8217;s. I&#8217;m coming for ya! =D</div>
