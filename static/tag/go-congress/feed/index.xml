				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 style="text-align: left;">Introduction</h2>
<p>For this week’s meditation, we are turning back the clock to my first game at the <a title="Go Congress 2014 — Prelude" href="//go-congress-2014-prelude/">U.S. Go Congress</a>! For those who need a refresher, this game was from the day I arrived in New York and was asked to play a match while we were waiting for people to arrive. It’s a fun game that shows just how you can find the opportunity to reverse a game if you’re willing to roll up your sleeves and complicate things. Hope you enjoy this game!<br />

<h2 style="text-align: left;">One Point Lesson</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">When you’re behind, making the game complicated is your best chance at reversing the game back in your favor.</p>

1,Opening,<strong>Move 9</strong> &#8211; This pincer was the right idea., <strong>Move 11</strong> &#8211; This attachment was just awful.<br />

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center;"><a title="Go Congress 2014 — Prelude" href="//go-congress-2014-prelude/">Prelude</a> &#8211; <a title="Go Congress 2014 — Day 1" href="//go-congress-2014-day-1/">I</a> &#8211; <a title="Go Congress 2014 — Day 2" href="//go-congress-2014-day-2/">II</a> &#8211; <a title="Go Congress 2014 — Day 3" href="//go-congress-2014-day-3/">III</a> &#8211; <a title="Go Congress 2014 — Day 4" href="//go-congress-2014-day-4/">IV</a> &#8211; <strong>V</strong> &#8211; <a title="Go Congress 2014 — Day 6" href="//go-congress-2014-day-6/">VI</a> &#8211; <a title="Go Congress 2014 — Day 7" href="//go-congress-2014-day-7/">VII </a>&#8211; <a title="Go Congress 2014 — Conclusion" href="//go-congress-2014-conclusion/">Conclusion</a></p>
<p class="p1">With the tournament officially off my mind, I have to admit it was kind of refreshing waking up without the worry of getting there at a specific time. I still got up a bit early though, as I wanted to run on over to sign up for simuls before the spots filled up. After all, since I wasn’t playing in the tournament anymore, I decided to set a new goal for myself: get as many simul games with professionals as possible!</p>
<p class="p1">After putting myself down for two games, my girlfriend and I went off to try a popular breakfast place: Clinton St. Baking Company. And while there was a decently long wait (considering it was a Thursday morning), it was definitely well worth it.</p>
<figure id="attachment_5734" style="width: 800px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/09/2014GC-D05-03.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-5734" src="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/09/2014GC-D05-03.jpg?resize=720%2C540" alt="Blueberry pancakes with maple butter syrup...

<figure id="attachment_5735" style="width: 800px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/09/2014GC-D05-04.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-5735" src="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/09/2014GC-D05-04.jpg?resize=720%2C540" alt="It was so good I had to put a second picture. Haha." width="720" height="540" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">It was so good I had to put a second picture. Haha.</figcaption></figure>
<p class="p1">By the time I got back to Congress, the match had already finished and people were getting ready for the pro events (i.e., lectures, game reviews, simuls, etc.). I would be playing Jennie Shen 2p, who was Michael’s teacher.</p>
<p class="p1"><span id="more-5732"></span></p>
<p class="p1">The following is the game record:</p>

<div id='glift_display2' style='height:500px; width:100%; position:relative;'></div>
<script type='text/javascript'>gliftWidget = glift.create({"divId":"glift_display2","sgf":"http:\/\/bengozen.com\/\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/09\/2014.08.14-US-Go-Congress-Jennie-Shen-2p.sgf","display":{"theme":"DEFAULT","drawBoardCoords":"1"}});</script>

<p class="p1">After the game was finished, I made a point to introduce myself to Jennie and told her that I was friends with Michael. Her face lit up with a smile as she recognized who I was referring to and we talked a bit before I excused myself since I didn’t want to take her away from the simul games any longer.</p>
<p class="p1">Since my game ended early, I went off with my camera to find Myung (9p), Jungsang (9p), and Dahye (4p) since they had essentially designated me their unofficial photographer for the Congress.</p>
<p class="p1">Here you can see Dahye providing game reviews to members of the audience who had questions about their own games.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/09/2014GC-D05-08.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5736" src="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/09/2014GC-D05-08.jpg?resize=720%2C480" alt="2014GC-D05-08" width="720" height="480" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">In the next few shots, Myung and Jungsang were giving a lecture on recent developments in joseki that was apparently for dan players. However, I have to say that their explanations were easy to understand and I didn’t feel out of place as I listened to them.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/09/2014GC-D05-20.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5738" src="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/09/2014GC-D05-20.jpg?resize=720%2C480" alt="2014GC-D05-20" width="720" height="480" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">One of cool things about the Korean pro events that I forgot to mention is that they were giving out all sorts of prizes.* This included things like go related souvenirs (i.e., the go dice I talked about earlier in the week, miniature go board with Hikaru and Sai on it, etc.).</p>
<p class="p1">*Just to clarify, I am not saying that the other professionals didn&#8217;t have their own form of prizes and such, it&#8217;s just that I can only vouch for the Korean pro events since I didn&#8217;t get the chance to attend any of the other ones.</p>
<figure id="attachment_5739" style="width: 800px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/09/2014GC-D05-38.jpg"><img class="wp-image-5739 size-full" src="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/09/2014GC-D05-38.jpg?resize=720%2C540" alt="2014GC-D05-38" width="720" height="540" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Here you can see one of the gifts that someone won at this lecture: a portable go set that the Korean Baduk Association had produced.</figcaption></figure>
<p class="p1">After the lecture concluded, I went upstairs to my final simul of the day against Shirley Lin, 1p. The following is the game record:</p>

<div id='glift_display3' style='height:500px; width:100%; position:relative;'></div>
<script type='text/javascript'>gliftWidget = glift.create({"divId":"glift_display3","sgf":"http:\/\/bengozen.com\/\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/09\/2014.08.14-US-Go-Congress-Shirley-Lin-1p.sgf","display":{"theme":"DEFAULT","drawBoardCoords":"1"}});</script>

<p class="p1">After my game, I went to see what everyone was up to but had a difficult time locating anyone. So with no one to hangout with or any concrete plans, I took my girlfriend out to a vegetarian kosher place (which was absolutely amazing).</p>
<figure id="attachment_5740" style="width: 800px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/09/2014GC-D05-40.jpg"><img class="wp-image-5740 size-full" src="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/09/2014GC-D05-40.jpg?resize=720%2C540" alt="2014GC-D05-40" width="720" height="540" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">This was their black-eyed pea cake, which was a phenomenal appetizer.</figcaption></figure>
<figure id="attachment_5741" style="width: 800px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/09/2014GC-D05-41.jpg"><img class="wp-image-5741 size-full" src="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/09/2014GC-D05-41.jpg?resize=720%2C540" alt="2014GC-D05-41" width="720" height="540" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">This was their special that night, which was similar to their braised seitan with spinach and mushrooms. It was delicious!</figcaption></figure>
<p class="p1">After dinner though, my memory is a bit hazy as to whether anything else of significance happened that night. I vaguely remember going back to Congress to talk with Myung, but I can’t remember much else happening. Haha. Nonetheless, it was a fun day that consisted of good food and go!</p>

<p>Today was the official rest day for Congress. In other words, this meant that there would be no tournament matches so that people could go and explore New York if they wanted. As you might suspect though, there was a group of people who were here for go and just that alone. So in honor of these dedicated players, they had a “Die Hard Tournament” for these players.<br />
When I arrived at Hotel Pennsylvania, I found Nate and the gang hanging out.<br />
<a href="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/09/2014GC-D04-01.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5716" src="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/09/2014GC-D04-01.jpg?resize=720%2C540" alt="2014GC-D04-01" width="720" height="540" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><br />
<span id="more-5710"></span><br />
They seemed to have various plans for the day, so my brother and I decided to head out to try this soup dumpling place that he had been telling me about. Just as we were waiting for the metro to come however, I got a call from Myung inviting us for lunch. Doesn’t take a genius to guess what we did right? We hightailed it right out of the metro and went to meet up with Myung.<br />
When we arrived in Koreatown, we found Myung, Evan Cho (who was a strong amateur dan player that I had heard Myung talk about numerous times), and Mark Lee (who was another strong amateur from Korea). Both Evan and Mark were participating in the Master’s Tournament for Congress (which was reserved essentially for 5d and higher). So we talked a little about that and proceeded with the normal introductions and conversation.<br />
The food at the restaurant was traditional and authentic Korean food. And by that I mean we didn’t just eat Korean BBQ, but actual dishes that Korean people would normally eat at home or at a typical sit down restaurant. Apparently beef is pretty expensive in Korea. So while some of us would like to dream that every restaurant in Korea is just Korean BBQ, that is not the case. Haha.<br />
After finishing a delicious lunch, my brother and I planned go with Myung, Evan, and Mark one of the popular museums in New York (I can’t remember which); but after some time projections, we realized that we wouldn’t have time to go to the museum and also get my brother back in time to Penn Station. So we parted ways with them and headed off to let my brother get his things together.<br />
When the time came for him to leave, I have to admit I was a little sad to see my brother go. It might be some older brother instinct, but I had a great time hanging with him in NY and felt a little anxious watching him board the train on his own. I know I know… the guy is in his early 20’s, but I don’t think I’ll ever stop looking out for him. Haha.<br />
To get my mind off whether or not he’d be okay taking the train back on his own, I went back to Hotel Pennsylvania to see what everyone was up to. As I walked into the lobby, a little serendipity to have been in play because I ran into Michael as he was heading out. For those who don’t know, he was only able to stay for half the Congress, so I was really happy to be able to catch him before he left.<br />
<a href="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/09/2014GC-D04-02.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5717" src="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/09/2014GC-D04-02.jpg?resize=600%2C800" alt="2014GC-D04-02" width="600" height="800" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><br />
When I got to the top floor, I remember that I couldn’t really find anyone. It seemed everyone had headed off to do their own thing, so I sat down with my laptop and started working on some things. Sometime later, fellow UMBC alumni Nathan Epstein (henceforth referred to as Nathan and is not to be confused with Nate Eagle) came over to chat.<br />
In the midst of talking about the tournament and my withdrawal from the tournament, he pulled out this dice that he had gotten from one of the teaching seminars.<br />
<figure id="attachment_5719" style="width: 600px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/09/2014GC-D04-04.jpg"><img class="wp-image-5719 size-full" src="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/09/2014GC-D04-04.jpg?resize=600%2C800" alt="asdf" width="600" height="800" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">(Current side) One-space jump, (Bottom side) Large knight move, (Other sides) Small knight move, Diagonal, Two-space jump, Large diagonal move (i.e., elephant jump)</figcaption></figure>
Apparently this was a teaching apparatus for helping teach players about haengma (i.e., stone movement) and shape. So when he asked me if I wanted to try playing a game, I couldn’t refuse! For those who are wondering how this variant of go works, the rules are pretty simple:</p>
<ol>
<li>Start with a cross-fuseki formation with stones on the star points for both players.</li>
<li>Black goes first.</li>
<li>Player rolls the die.</li>
<li>Based on the haengma that shows up, you can use any stone of the board to move according to that haengma.</li>
<li>After player makes his move, the other player takes his turn.</li>
</ol>
<p>Though it took a little getting used to, I actually really enjoyed playing it and hope to play it again. And if anyone knows anyone selling those die, please be sure to let me know!<br />
After that fun game, I headed out for the remainder of the day since my girlfriend was arriving in town. And with that, the first half of Go Congress had come and gone. Tomorrow, the start of the second half of Go Congress!</p>

<p>When I woke up, I sat in silence for a while as I thought about what I was going to do. Although some would simply shrug off the forfeit and continue playing in the tournament, I couldn’t stand the idea of continuing in the tournament. And with my brother in town and my girlfriend coming up to visit the second half of the trip, my mind was made up.<br />
When I arrived at Hotel Pennsylvania, I went and officially withdrew myself from the tournament. I know that this decision might not sit well with some of you, but it was really the best decision for me as a whole. While it would have been great to have played in the tournament, withdrawing from the tournament freed up my schedule to spend time with my brother (and girlfriend eventually) while also allowing me the freedom to do whatever I wanted (i.e., spending time with professionals).<br />
Anyhow, I then entered the tournament room to see if anyone was up and around. As I walked around, I found Diego and Gurujeet in the middle of an intense game.<br />
<a href="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/09/2014GC-D03-01.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5689" src="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/09/2014GC-D03-01.jpg?resize=720%2C540" alt="2014GC-D03-01" width="720" height="540" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><br />
I vaguely remember catching Nate and Michael before the round started and wishing them the best of luck. And before I left, I went ahead and signed up for three simuls that day. After all, I could play in tournaments anytime I wanted back at home, it’s the professionals that made Congress as epic as it is.<br />
<span id="more-5682"></span><br />
After going to breakfast, I came back to play my first simul against Zhang Yu Hong, 5p.<br />
<a href="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/09/2014GC-D03-04.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5690" src="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/09/2014GC-D03-04.jpg?resize=600%2C800" alt="2014GC-D03-04" width="600" height="800" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><br />
The game record is as follows:<br />

<p>Shortly after finishing my simul, I got a call from Myung 9p asking me if I was free to help take pictures for him and Dahye 4p while they were teaching a class. Since the next simul was not for a while and I had finished my game early, I rushed off to help them take pictures.<br />
<a href="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/09/2014GC-D03-10.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5691" src="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/09/2014GC-D03-10.jpg?resize=720%2C480" alt="2014GC-D03-10" width="720" height="480" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><br />
Once the class was done, I headed up to the top floor (where the main convention was held). When I arrived, I ran into Michael who informed me that the store was now open. Words cannot describe how excited I was to go check the store out. After all, one of the major aspects of a convention is the store where you can spend your money on souvenirs and such!<br />
<figure id="attachment_5692" style="width: 800px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/09/2014GC-D03-28.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-5692" src="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/09/2014GC-D03-28.jpg?resize=720%2C540" alt="You can see Michael in this shot!" width="720" height="540" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">You can see Michael in this shot!</figcaption></figure>
It was like being a kid in the candy store. I seriously couldn’t believe my eyes as tables full of books were stretched across the room. There wasn’t as much go equipment as I would have liked to seen, but it was a respectable collection nonetheless. And on that note, they were selling autographed fans from professionals as well! Though memory isn’t serving me well at the moment, Michael purchased one of these fans. I can’t remember which professional it was, but I’m pretty sure he’ll be commenting below on which one he got whenever he sees this.* Nonetheless, it was great to see so much go merchandise in one place.<br />
<em>*Update: Michael got a Sakata Eio fan. Many thanks to Satoru for the reminder! I should&#8217;ve remembered! Haha.</em><br />
Once we were done browsing the shop, I can&#8217;t remember if this is precisely when it happened, but Michael and I finished our game from yesterday. The following is the game record:<br />

<p>After the game, I was scheduled for another simul and parted ways with Michael. I was slotted to play against another Chinese professional, Ding Bo, 5p. The following is the game record:<br />

<p>After the simul, I can’t really remember what I did; but I imagine it consisted of exploring New York city with my brother and trying more food. Towards the evening though, I came back to Hotel Pennsylvania to play my third and final simul of the day. Nate, Michael and Dalan were scheduled to play against one of the new Japanese professional, Francis Meyers, 1p. You can see them here in action!<br />
<a href="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/09/2014GC-D03-29.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5693" src="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/09/2014GC-D03-29.jpg?resize=720%2C540" alt="2014GC-D03-29" width="720" height="540" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><br />

I had signed up to play against a Japanese professional as well, Deguchi Mariko, 1p. Satoru was on the waiting list, but fortunately the people who signed up didn’t show up and he was allowed to play.<br />
<a href="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/09/2014GC-D03-40.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5702" src="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/09/2014GC-D03-40.jpg?resize=720%2C540" alt="2014GC-D03-40" width="720" height="540" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><br />
The following is the game record:<br />

<p>After the game, I ran into Myung who asked me if I was up for getting food. Like he needed to ask. Haha. Jungsang hadn’t even yet however, so we waited for him to finish him simul game before heading out.<br />
<figure id="attachment_5701" style="width: 800px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/09/2014GC-D03-38.jpg"><img class="wp-image-5701 size-full" src="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/09/2014GC-D03-38.jpg?resize=720%2C540" alt="2014GC-D03-38" width="720" height="540" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">That guy stared at the board for so long trying to find a way to win&#8230; Let it go man.</figcaption></figure>
To keep a long story short, Jungsang’s simul game was an informal one he agreed to that took FOREVER. Seriously, the guy was playing to win and taking forever to make his moves. And when it comes to go etiquette, that’s extremely rude when you consider the fact that it is an informal game that also is a simul.<br />
While we waited, I went around and took pictures of the crazy go event that was going on on the other side of the room. Here you’ll see pictures of go in all shapes and sizes:<br />

After what seemed like forever, Myung, Jungsang and I were finally off to grab Shake Shack again. Haha. Except this time, we didn’t have the luxury of eating in since it was so crowded. So we brought the food back to Hotel Pennsylvania and holed up in one of the lecture rooms on the 6th floor.<br />
As we were sitting there and eating our delicious burgers, we talked about numerous things. Of course, as usual though, there were times where Jungsang wanted to say something more complicated and switched to Korean. And as I sat there listening to Myung and Jungsang talk, I came to a conclusion: I need to learn Korean. There’s just no getting around it. Haha. After all, with how invested I am in the go world and my increasing exposure to Korean professionals, it just didn’t make sense not to learn it.<br />
Anyhow, before long it was time for everyone to head off to bed and get some rest. And as I prepared to go to sleep, I couldn’t help but feel even more assured in my decision to withdraw from the tournament. After all, if I had participated in the tournament, I probably would have been too tired to play in all those simul games. And if I left early to find food, I wouldn’t have gotten a chance to hangout with Myung and Jungsang! No matter though, I had experienced the day fully and nodded off to sleep with no regrets.</p>

<p>The next day I woke up late. Since I knew that my games took a long time, I figured that it would be best for me to grab breakfast before heading off to the match. After all, the worst thing that would happen is that I would have less time. Right?<br />
When I arrived, I found everyone sitting and playing their matches. As I looked down the pairings list, I noticed that my name was already marked with results. F? My opponent’s name circled? What the heck? Does that mean what I think it means?<br />
As I scanned the list, I saw there were quite a few others as well. So I rushed off to find the tournament director, and sure enough, it was what I feared: forfeit.<br />

Needless to say, I was furious. After all, the worst I expected was that my time would be reduced. I was fuming for quite some time, and tried my best to calm down. I even tried to read through the entire handbook thinking that at least if it were written somewhere I would at least acknowledge my ignorance. Nope. Nothing.<br />
To be honest, this bothered me for quite some time. I tried my best to let it go, but I just couldn’t help myself from feeling so wronged. Some tried to tell me that it was announced during before the match, but announcements are only useful if you were there to hear it. And if you were there to hear it, I don’t really think you need to worry about a forfeit rule. And also, during the registration phase, they ask you point blank if you plan on playing in all the tournament rounds. What’s the point of that if you’re going to forfeit people after they’re late?! Especially when the rule is nowhere to be found!!<br />
Once all the matches were over, I caught up with Michael and started a game with him. We had to adjourn midway through the game since the pro events were starting, but don&#8217;t worry, we get around to finishing the game (which I&#8217;ll show the kifu of later on).<br />
As Michael went off to his pro event, I waited around in hopes of getting a simul game against Ho Yuu, 6p. Fortunately for me, the people who had signed up didn’t show up and I was able to get a seat.<br />

Here are the results of that game:<br />

<p>Though I ended up losing, he told me that I played quite well and would have actually won if I had not let me connection get cut apart. It was a game I was certainly proud of and one that helped me release some of my frustration since I poured all my energy into playing the best go I could possibly play.<br />
Everyone had dispersed at that point, so I wandered around a bit while waiting for the next simul to begin. For this next one, I was really hoping to be able to get a simul against Park Jungsang, 9p. Yes, the very same person I just had late dinner with last night! The reason I was a bit iffy on this one however, is because it was a simul that was reserved for dan players.<br />
Nonetheless, I went ahead and asked if I could play anyhow. Thanks to Jungsang’s kindness, I was allowed to play even though I wasn’t technically registered as a dan player.<br />
<a href="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/09/2014GC-D02-16.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5671" src="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/09/2014GC-D02-16.jpg?resize=720%2C540" alt="2014GC-D02-16" width="720" height="540" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><br />
The following is the game record:<br />

<p>Here’s the thing. I’ve played against a fair of number of professionals at this point in simul games, but the feeling I was left with after Jungsang crushed me was incredible. Even though I was well aware of how strong professionals could be, the simul against Jungsang took it to a whole new level of respect and awe.<br />
Once I was done with the game, it seemed like everyone had run off in different directions. Since my brother and I hadn’t eaten lunch yet, I decided that we would go ahead and go grab something to eat.<br />
After being indecisive for a while, we finally decided on this sushi place. Funny thing is that we didn’t see anything impressive on the menu when we got there, and ended up trying their yakitori instead.<br />
<a href="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/09/2014GC-D02-19.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5672" src="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/09/2014GC-D02-19.jpg?resize=720%2C540" alt="2014GC-D02-19" width="720" height="540" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><br />
It was a fantastic time and I had a blast hanging out with my brother. During this time, I vented about my frustration with what happened and my thoughts on what I wanted to do next. To experience that injustice of getting burned by a rule that wasn’t written and available to all players really put a damper on my experience at Congress. I mean seriously, it’s the equivalent of finding out that there is a rule that your opponent gets an extra 20 points of komi if the game is longer than 250 moves.<br />
To be honest, the rest of the day is a bit hazy to me as I try to recall it now. The forfeit was rather traumatic and affected me more than I would like to admit.What I can say for sure though, is that I spent a good part of that day evaluating whether or not I actually wanted to continue playing in a tournament.<br />
And if memory serves me correctly, my brother and I wandered around a bit more and got Halal Guys (aka famous food truck in NY for a $6 meal that is amazing). And after that food adventure, I went to dinner with Diego, Michael, Satoru, and Diego’s friend Mark. It was a fun dinner full of great conversation and I got a glimpse into the awesome world of judo as well. While the forfeit was a big damper on the day, I’m glad I was able to end the day with friends and good times.<br />
<em>Update: I just wanted to clarify that I&#8217;m not in any way saying that my conduct in being late to the match is excusable or acceptable. If I could have gone back and done it again, I would have ran to Congress first and at least let my opponent know I would be back after 10-15 minutes. The reason for my frustration and rant resides in the way the rule itself is implemented / enforced. While it is common courtesy to simply be on time for things, there are numerous reasonable situations where a person could be running late. And yes, sometimes people make incorrect decisions in the moment, but it should be penalized in a way that is fair for all.</em></p>

<p>The first official day of Go Congress! Woot! Needless to say, I was up bright and early and on my way to the hotel.<br />
The tournament was supposed to start around 9:00am, so I stopped by the hotel cafe to grab a quick breakfast (which ended up being a croissant and an orange juice) since I wanted to make sure I got there on time.<br />
When I arrived, the simuls and events were mostly filled; so I made a mental note to myself to aim to arrive earlier in the future if I wanted to get in a simul game.<br />
As everyone shuffled in, we all waited for the tournament pairings to be put up. And while we were all trying to relax and enjoy simply being at Go Congress, there was definitely a bit of anxiety throughout the air as this was our first match of the tournament. After all, everyone was hoping to start off the tournament with a win.<br />
Before we knew it though, we all went off on our separate ways to find our opponents. My opponent was an Asian girl named Kelly who was probably around fourth or fifth grade. After sitting down and setting up my iPad (for recording the game) and getting my headphones ready, we fiddled around with the clock for a bit to make sure we had the right time settings.<br />
<a href="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/09/2014GC-D01-01.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5648" src="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/09/2014GC-D01-01.jpg?resize=720%2C480" alt="2014GC-D01-01" width="720" height="480" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><br />
<span id="more-5647"></span><br />
It took us a little while to get it right, but we eventually did and started our game. I was pretty nervous since I hadn’t played in a competitive setting for quite some time, but I went ahead and gave it my best shot. The game record is below:<br />

<p>Though I lost, I have to say that overall I felt I played quite well. I made a drastic miscalculation toward the end that allowed her to destroy everything I had gained, but that is just a lesson learned for the future.<br />
With a loss under my belt, I went off to see how everyone else was doing. Nate was still in the middle of his game, so I went off and eventually found Satoru sitting off on his own. We sat down and talked about our respective games. Soon after, Michael and Nate came to join us and we showed our games to one another.<br />
<a href="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/09/2014GC-D01-08.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5649" src="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/09/2014GC-D01-08.jpg?resize=720%2C480" alt="2014GC-D01-08" width="720" height="480" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><br />
<a href="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/09/2014GC-D01-10.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5650" src="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/09/2014GC-D01-10.jpg?resize=720%2C480" alt="2014GC-D01-10" width="720" height="480" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><br />
As much as it was unfortunate at the time, it was rather funny that we all lost our first matches. And if I remember correctly, most (if not all) of the games were ones that we actually should have won. Haha.<br />
At this point of the day, it was about to be lunchtime; but most of the gang already had signed up for events or had something planned. Nate, for instance, had signed up for a simul with Andy Liu (1p). So I decided to go ahead and wait around to see what the turnout was like for the simuls.<br />
If you recall, at the Baduk Open Championship, I met a Korean professional by the name of Sohyun Park 4p. And though I was sad she wasn’t able to come to the Go Congress, her friend Dahye Lee 4p had come and was also bringing along something from Sohyun. So needless to say, I was excited to meet her friend!<br />
In lieu of all that, Dahye 4p was scheduled to have a simul around this time; so I was hoping to be able to catch her so I could introduce myself and possibly play with her.<br />
Upon introducing myself, her eyes lit up as she realized who I was and she greeted me warmly. I started out speaking in English, but I soon found out (to my surprise) that she actually spoke Chinese! Guess who also speaks Chinese? Hoorah!<br />
Once the introductions had been made, I asked her if I could play in the simul against her. My rationale at the time was that there were only 3 boards scheduled for the simul, so I figured a fourth wouldn’t hurt since it was more a teaching game than anything else. And sure enough, she was very gracious and allowed me to play.<br />

It had been a while since I last played a professional, but I remembered the feeling quite well and was intent on giving her everything I got. The game record is below:<br />

<div id='glift_display11' style='height:500px; width:100%; position:relative;'></div>

<p>Once I had resigned, Dahye (4p) was kind enough to spend time highlighting the important parts of the game and inform me when I had made mistakes. I was very grateful to have her spend time teaching me since the other simuls were still technically going on.<br />
As I was about to leave, she handed me a present and told me that we would arrange another time for me to get Sohyun gift. Needless to say I was beaming as I thanked her again for letting me play and teaching me.<br />
With my simul game finished, my brother and I went off to find Nate deep in thought against Andy (1p). Here are some shots of him in action:<br />
<a href="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/09/2014GC-D01-28.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5656" src="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/09/2014GC-D01-28.jpg?resize=720%2C480" alt="2014GC-D01-28" width="720" height="480" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><br />

Apparently they ended up getting in a huge ko fight that allowed Nate to win the game. Congrats to Nate for winning against a professional!<br />
Once Nate finished his game and we all talked for a bit, my brother and I headed out to get lunch since I hadn’t eaten anything since like 8:30am and it was around 3pm at this time. Everyone else was planning on grabbing something quick since they wanted to catch other events going on (i.e., lectures, game reviews, etc.), so I headed out with my brother off to Brooklyn for some awesome pizza.<br />
<a href="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/09/2014GC-D01-40.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5658" src="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/09/2014GC-D01-40.jpg?resize=720%2C540" alt="2014GC-D01-40" width="720" height="540" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><br />
By the time we got back to Congress, it was well into the evening. As I walked around, I had no idea where everyone was. Most of the events for the day had concluded, but there was a 13&#215;13 tournament going on. Sure enough, I managed to find nate and Michael entrenched in their games.<br />
<a href="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/09/2014GC-D01-42.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5659" src="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/09/2014GC-D01-42.jpg?resize=720%2C480" alt="2014GC-D01-42" width="720" height="480" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><br />
<a href="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/09/2014GC-D01-49.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5660" src="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/09/2014GC-D01-49.jpg?resize=720%2C480" alt="2014GC-D01-49" width="720" height="480" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><br />
Since I wasn’t participating, I stuck around to watch for a bit; but then I went off to see what sorts of random events were going on. Somewhere in the midst of that wandering though, I got a text from Myung (9p) asking me if I was up for getting a bite to eat. There was a burger place he wanted to try: Shake Shack. Without any hesitation, I told him I’d be happy to go with him; but I warned him that the lines would be decently long.<br />
We met in the lobby, but before we headed out, a friend of his was going to join us since he hadn’t eaten as well. Who was this friend? Jungsang Park (9p).<br />
As we walked to Shake Shack, I kept mostly to myself since Jungsang (9p) didn’t speak much English. So as you can imagine, it was mostly Myung (9p) and Jungsang talking to one another in Korean. To my utter surprise however, I found out that Jungsang actually spoke Chinese! And quite well in fact!<br />
So for the second time that day, my ability to speak Chinese allowed me to bridge a communication barrier with another Korean professional. You have no idea how thankful I was to my parents for making sure I learned it as a kid!<br />

The line was long as predicted, but it was great to be able to hangout with Myung (9p) and Jungsang (9p). And to my relief, they were very happy with the food and felt that the wait was worth it.<br />
With our bellies full of delicious Shake Shack, we walked back to the hotel. As they were both tired, they went off to their rooms. I managed to find Nate and a few of the other guys hanging around. After some chit chat though, we were all getting tired so we headed off.</p>

<p>When I woke up that Saturday morning, I was excited that the day had finally come. My first Go Congress ever! Woot!<br />
I had the pleasure of having my little brother come up with me for the first half of the trip. And while packing was more of a hassle than I anticipated, we were on our way before we knew it.<br />
When we arrived in NY, the first thing we did was check-in to our hotel. Though pretty much everyone was staying at the Hotel Pennsylvania, I was staying at a Marriott about two to three blocks away since I had guests coming up to visit. In addition, since I was going to be living there for over a week, I wanted to get a nicer place anyhow since the price wasn’t that much more expensive.<br />
After checking in and unloading my backpack, we went to a nearby Japanese curry shop that was highly rated on Yelp called GoGoCurry.<br />
<img class="aligncenter wp-image-5582 size-full" src="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/09/2014GC-D00-04.jpg?resize=600%2C800" alt="2014GC-D00-04" width="600" height="800" data-recalc-dims="1" /><br />
My brother got the pork katsu while I tried the grand slam (which was everything they had: sausage, chicken, pork, tempura shrimp). And while everything was delicious, I think I’ll opt for one of the regular plates next time since the grand slam was a lot more food than I was bargaining for. (Don’t get me wrong though, it was a fantastic value for the price!)<br />
With our stomachs full of good food, we headed off to check-in at the Go Congress.<br />

As you can see, there weren’t too many people there when we arrived, so we sat down for a little bit and my brother went off to explore a bit. Before I could really get caught up in anything, I happened to see a guy walking by with the name tag that said “Dalan.” Me being me, I stopped him as he was about to walk by and asked, “You wouldn’t happen to be Dalan from KGS would you?” And who would guess, but it was him!<br />
We chatted for a while before he headed off to do something else, but shortly after Nate arrived in the room! We chatted for a bit and took in the sights of the convention, but before we knew it we had a quite a few people starting to gather in our area. One guy in particular, named David, decided to ask us if anyone wanted to play a game. Since I hadn’t played in a while, I wanted to volunteer Nate to play; but before I knew it, I was taking Black against him (since he said he was 1 kyu).<br />
Below is the game record along with some shots that my brother took while I was playing the game.<br />

Though I was rather rusty, I thought the game turned out quite well if I do say so myself. Granted, it was a casual game, so I’m sure he would have approached the game differently had it been during the tournament. Nonetheless, I thought it was a fun game anyhow.<br />
While my game was going on, Nate started a game with a player I believe was named Bernie (but I could be wrong). Here are a few shots of him mid-game.<br />
<img class="aligncenter wp-image-5597 size-full" src="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/09/2014GC-D00-35.jpg?resize=720%2C480" alt="2014GC-D00-35" width="720" height="480" data-recalc-dims="1" /><br />
<img class="aligncenter wp-image-5600 size-full" src="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/09/2014GC-D00-46.jpg?resize=533%2C800" alt="2014GC-D00-46" width="533" height="800" data-recalc-dims="1" /><br />
After I had wrapped up my game, Satoru made his grand entrance! Here’s a shot of him getting introduced to Nate as Nate realizes who he actually is. Priceless moment captured by Eric.<br />
<img class="aligncenter wp-image-5599 size-full" src="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/09/2014GC-D00-44.jpg?resize=720%2C480" alt="2014GC-D00-44" width="720" height="480" data-recalc-dims="1" /><br />
So while Nate is wrapping up his game, I was sitting down with Satoru to show him what happened during my game. Funny thing was that there was this guy who had been watching and paying attention. Somewhere in the middle of the review, he asked me if I was BenGoZen. Turns out it was Michael (aka moboy78)! What a surprise for me to have him track me down. Haha.<br />

A couple hours pass us by as we talk and catch up. Before we know it though, the opening ceremonies were starting!<br />
<figure id="attachment_5603" style="width: 800px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/09/2014GC-D00-54.jpg"><img class="wp-image-5603 size-full" src="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/09/2014GC-D00-54.jpg?resize=720%2C480" alt="2014GC-D00-54" width="720" height="480" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Andy Okun (President of the AGA)</figcaption></figure>

Overall, the opening ceremony was quite entertaining. My favorite part was the keynote speaker who had an interesting perspective on how to spread go in today’s gaming environment and made some fascinating insights into the current gaming culture in relation to go. I won’t get into it much here, but it is suffice to say that I agreed with most of his principles and will expound on it further when I am further along with my own ideas.<br />
When the opening ceremony was finally over, it was pretty late. If I recall correctly, it was somewhere between 8-9pm when we finally set off to find dinner. Satoru hadn’t really eaten anything and was pretty hungry, so we raced off to try a ramen place called Totto Ramen.<br />
Fortunately Eric had just been in NY the previous week, so he recognized the area we were in and recommended that we put our names down at Ippudo’s (another ramen place) as well since their wait was often shorter than what they told you. Sure enough, Totto Ramen’s wait was like an hour long while Ippudo only ended up being a 10-15 minute wait. With Satoru requiring sustenance, it doesn’t take a 9 dan to figure out where we ended up eating.<br />
Here are some shots of our meal.<br />
<figure id="attachment_5615" style="width: 800px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-5615 size-full" src="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/09/2014GC-D00-76.jpg?resize=720%2C540" alt="2014GC-D00-76" width="720" height="540" data-recalc-dims="1" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Roasted pork buns&#8230;.

<h2 style="text-align: center;"><strong>APRIL FOOLS!!!!! xD</strong></h2>
<p>To be honest, I had no intentions of pranking anyone or anything; but then I started drafting a post for today and then the idea just came to me. So&#8230; *bursts of laughing* you&#8217;ll have to forgive me for trolling you a little bit. (By the way, got to love that GIF. Captures how I&#8217;m feeling perfectly. Cracks me up.)<br />
Anyways&#8230; on a more serious note, today marks the beginning of April and thus a chance to start fresh as the official countdown to <a title="Go Congress Official Site" href="http://www.gocongress.org/">Go Congress</a> begins. Yup&#8230; I&#8217;ve registered. I haven&#8217;t paid yet since I want to make sure that nothing on the schedule alters my plans, but it&#8217;s practically set in stone.<br />
Since this is my first Go Congress, I&#8217;m really hoping to go there with a bang. In order to really reinvigorate my training in preparation for Go Congress, I&#8217;ve started:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Re-watching <a title="Hikaru no Go Wikipedia " href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hikaru_no_Go">Hikaru No Go</a> </strong>&#8211; It&#8217;s always good to start back with one of the most inspiring stories of all go stories.</li>
<li> <strong>Joined <a title="Yunguseng Dojang Official Site" href="http://www.yunguseng.com/">Yunguseng Dojang</a> </strong>&#8211; This is essentially an online insei program (from what I understand). My friend Diego has told me good things about it, so I&#8217;ve decided to give it a shot!</li>
<li><strong>Becoming super-disciplined about my tsumego training</strong> &#8211; In my last few games I&#8217;ve played on KGS, I&#8217;ve been reminded just how important reading is and how it can completely change the tide of the game when you&#8217;re able to read just one step further than your opponent.</li>
<li><strong>Working a lot harder on the blog</strong> &#8211; I know this might seem totally unrelated to my growth. And to some, it&#8217;ll hinder my progress as a player. However, the blog is something that I&#8217;ve come to really enjoy and has helped me be accountable for my own journey as a go player. Definitely do not regret any of the time I&#8217;ve spent on it!</li>
</ol>
<p>With that said, I also wanted to give a quick shoutout to <a title="Maaike's Twitter" href="https://twitter.com/My8ke">Maaike</a> and her <a title="Maaike's April Challenge Post" href="http://thegochallenge.blogspot.com/2014/04/april-challenge.html?utm_source=twitterfeed&amp;utm_medium=twitter">April Challenge</a>! Her April Challenge is to &#8220;get our of your comfort zone.&#8221; So, for this month, <strong>my challenge will be to play a territorial style and avoid a moyo style!</strong> I think that should be a good one right? (If you have a better one for me, please let me know!)<br />
Hope you all are doing well and don&#8217;t get pranked too much today!<br />
<em>PS. I haven&#8217;t forgotten about my Hong Kong posts. They are just taking a lot longer than anticipated.</em><br />
<em>PPS. One last thing, I&#8217;ll be releasing another combo review with frozensoul on the third jubango game next Wednesday (4/9), so be sure to be on a lookout for it!</em></p>

<a href="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/03/stoked.gif"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4750" alt="stoked" src="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/03/stoked.gif?resize=500%2C270" width="500" height="270" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><br />
For those wondering why I&#8217;m so excited, it&#8217;s because even though I have been blogging for a few years now and played for an equal amount of time, I have never been to a Go Congress.<br />
<figure id="attachment_4751" style="width: 300px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/03/wtf.gif"><img class="size-full wp-image-4751" alt="wtf" src="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/03/wtf.gif?resize=300%2C223" width="300" height="223" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Wait say what?!?!</figcaption></figure>
Yep&#8230; So anyhow, unless there is some cosmic force at play that I&#8217;m not aware of (where I&#8217;m destined to never go to a Go Congress), I will move heaven and earth to go this year. And so if you have any interest in going, please check out the link below and start getting ready for it!</p>
