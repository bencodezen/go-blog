				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 style="text-align: center;">Introduction</h2>
<p>Before this game, I had been getting white in most of my even games and had trouble playing properly. Games were often very rushed and I could hardly play a good game as White. However, after listening to Inseong talk about his views on playing White, I gave it a lot of thought and tried to get in a similar mindset.<br />
This game is the first game that I felt successful when playing White. Not only was my game not rushed and ill-conceived, but I felt like I was able to maintain control for most of the game. Hopefully you&#8217;ll agree! Enjoy the game.<br />

1,Opening,<strong>Move 20</strong> &#8211; I liked this extension in regards to the whole board since it seems like a proactive move., <strong>Move 9</strong> &#8211; I am unfamiliar with this position. Need to learn more about it in the future.<br />
2,Middle Game, <strong>Move 44</strong> &#8211; The cap started a sequence that allowed me to take the initiative in the middle game.,<strong>Move 104</strong> &#8211; Bad move that could have cost me the game.<br />
3,Fighting, <strong>Move 112</strong> &#8211; Ignoring Black to play here showed good fighting spirit., Can&#8217;t say that any of the fighting was bad for me this game. Correct me if I&#8217;m wrong though!<br />
4,Endgame, Not Applicable, Not Applicable<br />
5,Overall Reading, &#8220;<strong>Move 106</strong> &#8211; Though the reading is relatively simple, I was happy that I could read it out instantly with no doubt in my mind.&#8221;,<strong>Move 104</strong> &#8211; Worth mentioning twice. This was an overplay. I am lucky Black let me off the hook and made life instead.<br />

<p>I recently had a conversation regarding the importance of ladders. And while the topic of ladders will probably cause many people to roll their eyes at the topic time and time again, it&#8217;s simply one of those things that you keep having a deeper and deeper respect for as you dive into the abyss of go. Today&#8217;s game is short, but it illustrates the severity of not being able to perfectly read out a ladder.<br />
So whether you like it or not, you need to make your peace with ladders and make them your best friend. It&#8217;s the only way to climb to the top!<br />

1,Opening, <strong>Move 10</strong> &#8211; I&#8217;m proud of experimenting with a new joseki move I learned., <strong>Move 34</strong> &#8211; This seems questionable to me; but perhaps it was a necessary defense.<br />
2,Middle Game, <strong>Move 36</strong> &#8211; The sequence around here worked out really well in my favor., <strong>Move 52</strong> &#8211; This was rather small in regards to the whole board.<br />
3,Fighting, <strong>Move 48</strong> &#8211; My confidence in believing I could figure out the upper right corner was a good sign of healthy kiai., &#8220;<strong>Move 54</strong> &#8211; Though I was successful locally, this was small in regards to the whole board.&#8221;<br />
4,Endgame, Not Applicable, Not Applicable<br />
5,Overall Reading, <strong>Move 74</strong> &#8211; Being able to confidently read out this ladder was awesome., <strong>Move 58</strong> &#8211; The sequence around here didn&#8217;t quite work out the way I expected. Didn&#8217;t realize I needed a ladder to be able to really gain a foothold in this area.<br />

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 style="text-align: center;">Introduction</h2>
<p>Before playing this game, I had been studying one of Seo Bong Soo&#8217;s games from <a title="Book Review: The Fighting Styles of Kato Masao and Seo Bong Soo" href="//book-review-fighting-styles-kato-masao-seo-bong-soo/">Master Play: The Fighting Styles of Kato Masao and Seo Bong Soo</a>. And as I was replaying his game against Otake Hideo, I couldn&#8217;t help but wonder whether or not I had been wrong about my style of go this entire time. After all, I always thought I had a fighting style; but perhaps that is not really the case.<br />
Anyways, inspired by his game, I decided to try and imitate that same feeling in this game. And though I end up collapsing in on myself with a really basic reading mistake, I hope you&#8217;ll still find this game entertaining.<br />

1,Opening,Overall it felt okay considering it was a non-traditional opening; but nothing spectacular.,<strong>Move 28: </strong>This may have been too slow. Giving Black the initiative on the lower left was rough.<br />
2,Middle Game,It felt more or less in my favor; but a bit risky.,Black got a big left side which sort of forced me to try and kill his group.<br />
3,Fighting,<strong>Move 38:</strong> I was proud of starting this fight since I had an advantage in this area.,<strong>Move 98:</strong> This is probably my losing move. Letting my stones get weakened like that was bad.<br />
4,Endgame,Not Applicable,Not Applicable<br />
5,Overall Reading,<strong>Move 74-97:</strong> Felt proud for being able to continually harass this group / almost killing it.,<strong>Move 106:</strong> No excuses for this move. Complete misread.<br />

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 style="text-align: center;">Introduction</h2>
<p>And we&#8217;re back for the second week of Thursday Go Tygem! Unfortunately since the last game, I was demoted to 2d. No matter though! The opponents are still dans, so we march onwards!<br />
This game I take White against a 2d. The opening starts out with a terrible exchange on my part, and then a crazy fight for supremacy in the middle game breaks out after he makes a mistake in trying to cut apart my groups. Definitely a game that demonstrates how kiai (i.e., fighting spirit) can make a big difference in a position where you are initially at a disadvantage.<br />
As always, please let me know if there is anything I can do to improve this series for you guys!<br />

no,Category,Good,Bad<br />
1,Opening,<strong>Moves 44:</strong> Was proud to find this move to resist Black’s attempt to get an overwhelming advantage in the opening.,<strong>Move 18+:</strong> The push cut exchange made me over-concentrated and in bad position.<br />
2,Middle Game,Overall it felt like the middle game was in my favor and I outplayed my opponent.,<strong>Move 168:</strong> Avoiding the ko was so indescribably bad because there was no ko. *hangs head in shame* Could have been such an easy game&#8230;<br />
3,Fighting,<strong>Move 122+:</strong> I was quite proud to be able to fight on even grounds in such close proximity here.,<strong>Move 168:</strong> So shameful it gets restated twice. Just so bad.<br />
4,Endgame,<strong>Move 212:</strong> I was proud to find this attachment quickly to reduce Black’s area., Can’t say I was great at identifying the biggest value on the board; but tried to use sente/gote moves as my points of reference.<br />
5,Overall Reading,<strong>Move 80:</strong> Outreading Black by knowing the cut didn’t work was very satisfying.,<strong>Move 188:</strong> This should have been at R3 to make life in the corner and would have changed the result of the game.<br />
