[expand title=&#8221;Synopsis&#8221; trigclass=&#8221;expandTitle&#8221;]
<strong>What did I enjoy about the book?</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>A significant increase in my comfort to tenuki in the opening.</li>
<li>An eye-opening perspective on how to try to select my attacks now.</li>

</ul>
<p><strong>What style of teaching does the book use?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Workshop Format
<ul>

[expand title=&#8221;Before I Read This Book&#8230;&#8221; trigclass=&#8221;expandTitle&#8221;]
<strong>My Abilities</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A mid-high SDK (single digit kyu) who has read his fair share of books and has a decent foundation of most areas in go.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>My Perspective</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Since these are written to be more of a &#8220;workshop&#8221; format, I was looking forward to a new style of writing along with a refreshing perspective on some common questions that most players might have.</li>
</ul>
[/expand]
[expand title=&#8221;My Review&#8221; trigclass=&#8221;expandTitle&#8221; expanded=&#8221;true&#8221;]
This was a refreshing perspective on common go questions. Yilun Yang&#8217;s ability to break down popular topics like &#8220;Determining What Direction to Attack&#8221; was incredibly easy to understand. Contrary to some typical go literature where the concept is explained to death, Yang provides more of a road map on how to actually apply the principle instead of simply understanding it. Now granted, I will be the first to say that actually applying it to your game is not so easy; but my understanding has certainly grown and I am now trying out new things as a result. I am really looking forward to the next books in the series!<br />
