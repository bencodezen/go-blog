				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As many of you are aware, the US Go Congress 2013 is currently going on and everyone&#8217;s focus is on it. Though I have been living vicariously through some friends who were able to go and try to watch the games that are featured on KGS, I must say that I am rather sad that I was unable to attend this year. It would have been an incredible to be able to experience and blog about a go convention of that level; but alas, I am here and they are there.<br />
To console myself, I have been burying myself in more books in hopes of distracting myself from the constant reminders of how awesome Go Congress is. Haha. In addition, I have also decided that I will be making a sincere effort to make it out to US Go Congress 2014. So for all those who weren&#8217;t able to make it out this year, let&#8217;s try and start the preparations to make it out next year!</p>
