<p>As I promised last week, today is the grand opening of the new redesign for BenGoZen! It&#8217;s time to change your bookmarks, because BenGoZen now has its own domain name and is hosted on a completely new platform!</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;"><a href="/">www.bengozen.com</a></h2>
<p>For those who haven&#8217;t visited in a while, here are some of the new features that will be accessible to you on the new design!</p>
<ul>
<li>Easy Email &amp; RSS Subscription!</li>
<li>Embedded Eidogo Kifu so you can view the game right in the post!</li>
<li>Updated content layout for easier reading experience and better searching!</li>
<li>Translator tool in case you want to read my blog in another language!</li>
<li>Easy contact form so you can send me emails at any time!</li>
</ul>
<div>
And in case there is any confusion, there will no longer be any updates here on the Blogger platform. All comments have also been disabled to prevent any confusion as well, so make sure to come on over to the new <a href="/">site</a>! I assure you that it is worth it.<br />
With that in mind, hope to see you over at the new <a href="/">site</a>!<br />
<em>Also, for those of us that are being bombarded by Hurricane Sandy, I hope you are doing alright and have the good fortune of having electricity and internet so that you can be reading this. Take care!</em>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As much as I hate to do this, BenGoZen will be on hiatus for the rest of the month to prepare for a brand new blog redesign. I am currently working really hard to not only implement a brand new look and feel for the blog, but I&#8217;m also completely revising and improving the information architecture and content quality to make the entire experience more enjoyable and worthy of your time!<br />
To get you excited for some of the new changes coming in a week, here are some things you can expect to see!</p>
<ol>
<li>Subscribe via email and RSS with ease!</li>
<li>Eidogo Player back in full functionality so that you no longer have to leave the blog to see my games!</li>
<li>Easy translator widget that will allow you to view my content in many languages! (Although I won&#8217;t be able to verify fully the accuracy of the translation, the content will now be available to more people!)</li>
<li>New integrated comment system that will allow you to login from various social media avenues.</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Looking forward to seeing you on the grand opening &#8211; Halloween, October 31st, 2012!</strong></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It&#8217;s been five days since I last played a game of go, but it has felt like an eternity. Haha. I found myself logging onto KGS multiple times a day to look at game records of my friends or watch other games just to prevent myself from getting entangled in a game. It doesn&#8217;t quite measure up to playing, but it helped to satisfy the urge to just play. I&#8217;m looking forward to my game with Nate tomorrow, but I&#8217;ll probably be avoiding ranked games for a little.<br />
<span id="more-6"></span><br />
In terms of what I&#8217;ve been up to, I&#8217;m actually working pretty hard on getting this blog&#8217;s redesign ready for launch. I&#8217;m aiming for launching in the beginning of November, but we&#8217;ll see how it goes. I&#8217;m aiming to bring a big change to the blog that will improve the blog&#8217;s experience and quality of information.<br />
In addition, while working on the redesign has its own fun and adventure, I&#8217;ve been trying to expand my understanding of go theory. I had been trying to work on my reading abilities through The Elementary Go Series: <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Tesuji</span> and <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Life and Death</span>, but I was getting bored and unable to focus. So instead of trying to mindlessly finish the books, I moved on to more theoretical based books such as <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Attack and Defense</span> and <span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Power of the Star Point</span> for now. (Don&#8217;t get me wrong though. I&#8217;m still working on tsumego, just nothing mind bending at the moment.)<br />
If anyone has any ideas or suggestions for the blog redesign, please be sure to let me know! All comments and feedback would be greatly appreciated!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For those who are new or still following, a lot of my reviews and links are currently outdated at the moment. In other words, some products that I reviewed are no longer for sale, some stores are no longer selling go equipment, all my old kifu&#8217;s are broken, etc.<br />
Fear not however! I will be working hard these next couple weeks to completely redesign the blog for your reading enjoyment and so that this blog will continue to be a great source of reference for you or anyone you know looking to play go.<br />
If you have any suggestions, please feel free to leave a comment below so I can consider it in the redesign!</p>
