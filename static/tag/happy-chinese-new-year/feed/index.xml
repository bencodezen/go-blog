<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Happy Chinese New Year everyone! It&#8217;s the Year of the Horse and with that I think the theme for this new (lunar) year will be charging forward full speed!<br />
I&#8217;ve been a little quieter this week than I would have liked, but I&#8217;ve started on some new ventures that I think will greatly enhance my life and I&#8217;ll be sure to report on them once I feel I&#8217;ve settled down and gotten in a good rhythm with it. But meanwhile, I&#8217;ve been working hard on figuring out how to do game reviews effectively without consuming a lot of time. It seems as if I&#8217;m constantly trying to catch up on creating game reviews no matter how hard I try. I think the plan is to try and review the games immediately after in order to speed up the process.<br />
Second, I have been much more active on KGS that I have been in the past. In particular, I have actually started playing longer games again (i.e., 30 minutes main time each person). Many thanks goes out to my friend <a href="http://www.nateeagle.com/">Nate</a> for helping me get back on track. I will write a post on his advice to me later, so be looking out for that later.<br />
The other focus of mine has been to get the rest of my reviews finished within the next week or so. I still have a couple of product and book reviews to finish and they&#8217;ve been hanging over my head. So hopefully I&#8217;ll be able to get those done ASAP so I can alleviate that weight off my back.<br />
Finally, you&#8217;ll probably notice that I but the training regimen in half. This is due to the fact that I was actually having a hard time simply doing 10 a day. It&#8217;s not so much that I &#8220;couldn&#8217;t,&#8221; but more along the lines of I was unable to be consistent since the 10 problems felt like a lot more when you also have like 30 other things that need your attention that day. So I&#8217;m dropping it down to 5 to see if that can get me to a perfectly consistent level.</p>
<h2>Training Regimen</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Step #1:</strong> Do 5 go problems a day. (Estimated time: 5-10 minutes)</li>
