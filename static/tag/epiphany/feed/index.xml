Something interesting happened yesterday. I had just finished the arc in <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;ved=0CC8QFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FFighting_Spirit_(manga)&amp;ei=6IoOUrG_FaWbygGL6oCwAg&amp;usg=AFQjCNFFI0eP4wTVR8AszqReTx_t5ZpG1w&amp;sig2=vGXcojo8m7DpILIfiStOww&amp;bvm=bv.50768961,d.aWc">Hajime no Ippo</a> where Volg fights for a world title. And since I was looking to possibly play a game in real time, I got excited when I saw the chance to play someone from Russia. (For those who don&#8217;t understand the connection, Volg is a Russian boxer.) Before I knew it, I find myself neck deep in a complicated cross-fuseki game where all the fighting spirit I had been reading about had gotten into my blood and I was trying to strike at all of my opponent&#8217;s groups with everything I had.<br />
There was one particular moment (towards the end of the game) where I found myself in a rather precarious situation where I could either make certain of absolute life or leave it up to a capturing race. I know that the old me (and probably a lot of other players) would have probably chosen the sure route to life. However, it felt kind of surreal as I glanced at the position and realized that I could just tenuki because I already knew the end-result of the capturing race: Black would never win due to a shortage of liberties.<br />
The reason I&#8217;m writing about this is because I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve ever captured this kind of moment before in my journey. Do you know what I mean? It&#8217;s that moment where suddenly your training is starting to show its results and you feel as if something has dawned on you. In other words, all those tedious problems that I had practiced in the Level Up books had begun to show their true colors. Without much effort, I looked at my position and knew there was nothing to worry about.<br />
I know that I have been kind of out of it the past week; but what happened in yesterday&#8217;s game is a testament to my efforts before. And I think it&#8217;s just what I needed to kick my butt back into gear with my training. Time to revisit my training menu once again!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So here ends my Monday.  Overall, there was a lot of progression in terms of how I saw the game and what I know I need to do now.  I just played a free game with a weaker player who, for some reason, only wanted a two stone handicap.  It was definitely different to see such a difference in reading ability.  I mean I know he (or she) is only a 23k and I&#8217;m a 15k, but still&#8230; it wasn&#8217;t till I was playing him that I was like&#8230; Oh&#8230; that&#8217;s how stupid I must look to all the stronger players I&#8217;ve been playing.<br />
Overall.. here are my ratings for the day.</p>
<ol>
<li>Problems &#8211; Minimal</li>
<li>Theory &#8211; Minimal</li>
<li>Games &#8211; Satisfactory</li>
</ol>
<div>Hopefully I&#8217;ll be able to at least to satisfactory on all three on a more consistent basis.</div>
