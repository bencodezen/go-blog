				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Today&#8217;s game was a reminder of a concept I was told long ago in one of my teaching games:</p>
<blockquote><p>The less groups you have on the board, the more likely it is that you&#8217;re going to win.</p></blockquote>
<p>Sounds simple enough right? And yet at the same time, why is this the case?<br />

Let&#8217;s not forget an important aspect of Go &#8211; <strong>the players who use their stones the most efficiently are the ones who will most likely surround the most territory</strong>. After all, when you&#8217;re killing two birds with one stone, it becomes just about as close to having two moves as a player will ever get!<br />

<div id='glift_display1' style='height:500px; width:100%; position:relative;'></div>
<script type='text/javascript'>gliftWidget = glift.create({"divId":"glift_display1","sgf":"http:\/\/bengozen.com\/\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/08\/2012.08.31-Small-Number-of-Groups.sgf","display":{"theme":"DEFAULT","drawBoardCoords":"1"}});</script>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div align ='center'><noscript>Please enable JavaScript to view this game.</noscript> <a href='//wp-content/uploads/2012/08/2012.08.31-Small-Number-of-Groups.sgf' download>Download SGF</a></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
If we look at the results of my game, you&#8217;ll notice that Black has 5 different groups and White has 4 groups. Yet if you play close enough attention, you&#8217;ll see how much more efficient White&#8217;s stones were at surround territory compared to Black&#8217;s. In fact, a number of Black&#8217;s groups seems like they barely escape death.<br />
In terms of reflecting on my own play, I know that I experimented with a number of different plays that a higher ranked player would have probably punished nice and well. And in a few instances I tenuki&#8217;d when I should have paid more attention to the livelihood of the group. Overall though, I felt rather collected and was happy with each of my moves.</p>
