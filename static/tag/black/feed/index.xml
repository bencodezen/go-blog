				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>For this week&#8217;s meditation, we are going to start off nice and easy with a 9&#215;9 game I played on GoQuest a week or so ago. It&#8217;s not too crazy in regards to fighting, but is a great example of how powerful influence can be on such a small board. Hope that you enjoy the game and the commentary!<br />

<p style="text-align: left;">Never hesitate to take influence early on when playing on a small board, it is more powerful than you probably realize.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hey everyone. Just wanted to let you know I&#8217;m still alive and well. Been getting into some really interesting projects these past few weeks and have been really pondering what I can do with blogging again since I miss doing it. And as someone who hates it when a regular blogger just drops out of the blogosphere, you can rest assured that I won&#8217;t ever just leave the blog hanging in the event I need to close up shop for awhile.<br />
In terms of what I&#8217;ve been up to, I&#8217;ve been tinkering again with daily regimens and playing games via <a title="Dragon Go Server" href="http://www.dragongoserver.net/">DGS</a> and <a title="Online Go Server" href="http://www.online-go.com/">OGS</a> while concurrently juggling a new job and trying to learn a ton of new skills. I&#8217;ve gone all the way back down to the very basics of doing only 10 life and death problems a day. They&#8217;re not hard in any sense of the word, but they help me to keep a connection to the world of go.<br />
And as a special treat for those who miss my reviews, I&#8217;ve decided to try reviewing one of my 9&#215;9 games that I played recently on GoQuest via an awesome new social kifu reviewing software called <a title="GoKibitz" href="http://www.gokibitz.com/">GoKibitz</a> that a close friend and long time rival built himself. So I hope you enjoy the review and I will try and post again soon!<br />
UPDATE: Apparently all my comments got lost in the abyss of the internet&#8230;. Oy vey&#8230; I&#8217;ll try and get another version up soon&#8230;.<br />

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Over the last few days, part of my subconscious was nagging me for spending so much time not playing a single game. And while I did play at least one 9&#215;9 game a day, it has been ages since I last played a full 19&#215;19 game in real time. And for those who want to count the one at the Pumpkin Classic, that doesn’t really count since I wasn’t planning to play. So in another sense, I have been avoiding playing games in real time.<br />
Why is that? Good question. Believe it or not, over time I seem to have developed some sort of “ladder anxiety.” (I’m not sure this list the correct term, but I saw it recently and feel it’s rather appropriate.) To put it more bluntly, I’m afraid of playing ranked games because I’m worried about playing stupid moves and being judged by others.<br />
Yeah. I know. This probably sounds stupid to many of you, but somewhere along the line I started worrying about being judged even though I honestly have no reason to feel this way. If I had to attribute the cause to something, it would probably out of my own self-criticism that just got out of control. I set a bar of expectation so high for myself that any failure ended up being very damaging to me.<br />
Anyhow, bottom line is that I’ve been doing a bit of soul-searching and have been inspired by the reading I’ve been doing to finally start breaking free of this self-imposed prison. Whenever I manage to finally get this all resolved, I will be sure to write a full article in hopes of helping anyone else who might have the same issue.<br />
As evidence of this, here is the game that I played today. And while it is against a bot, I’m going to consider this one a success in my strive to get over my fear of playing. It’s a pretty weird game, but it was one that has bits of creativity throughout it.<br />

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 style="text-align: left;">Introduction</h2>
<p>For this week’s meditation, we are turning back the clock to my first game at the <a title="Go Congress 2014 — Prelude" href="//go-congress-2014-prelude/">U.S. Go Congress</a>! For those who need a refresher, this game was from the day I arrived in New York and was asked to play a match while we were waiting for people to arrive. It’s a fun game that shows just how you can find the opportunity to reverse a game if you’re willing to roll up your sleeves and complicate things. Hope you enjoy this game!<br />

<h2>Prologue</h2>
<p>Hey everyone. I’m glad to finally be able get Monday Go Meditation back up and running again. In a concerted effort to being consistent and making progress one step at a time, here is my revised philosophy on MGM:<br />
For those who remember, I eventually got caught up in trying to make MGM reflective of my actual progress and tried to keep all the game commentary as current as possible. However, I’ve come to learn that this was something I could not keep up with. So rather than abandon the effort all together, I will try and keep the game commentaries as current as I can; but no promises on it being in perfect sync with my actual progress.<br />
With that said, I’m looking forward to your insights on my games and all the great discussions to come!</p>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>The following game is one that I had the pleasure of playing last week thanks for Daurak. I still have some reservations about playing games, so it’s helpful to have friends who ask to play games. And just to clarify, our ranks are not accurate at the moment; so we went ahead and played an even game (although I think we accidentally did no komi).<br />
Hope you enjoy the game!<br />

1,Opening,<strong>Move 19</strong> &#8211; Recognizing the big point was critical in gaining the upper hand in the moyo race.,<strong>Move 39</strong> &#8211; This was too greedy. I should have just enclosed the corner.<br />
2,Attack and Defense, <strong>Move 99</strong> &#8211; Getting this allowed me to get the attack needed to maintain my lead., Nothing glaring as far as I can tell.<br />
3,Shape,<strong>Move 47</strong> &#8211; This move I made purely from shape knowledge.,<strong>Move 93</strong> &#8211; I wonder if there’s a better response; but I ended up with bad shape after the peep.<br />
4,Strategy, Overall I felt I was pretty consistent for the game.,<strong>Move 39</strong> &#8211; Must be reiterated for its greediness.<br />
5,Overall Reading,<strong>Move 129-133</strong> &#8211; Reading out the aji was a proud moment for me.,<strong>Move 58-69</strong> &#8211; I didn’t realized White would be able to connect so easily.<br />

<p>For this week, I’ve decided to honor a request made by my friend Rob who asked that I review the game that was the cause for my post on being confused. Though I haven’t been commenting on games from YSD, I’ve decided to make an exception for this one.<br />

1,Opening,<strong>Move 39</strong> &#8211; This move is the only one I’m “proud” of since it took full advantage of White’s mistake in this joseki.,<strong>Move 19 and 29</strong> &#8211; Both these moves were bad since I was unable to punish White for his mistake in the joseki.<br />
2,Attack and Defense,<strong>Move 97</strong> &#8211; Recognizing that my group was in trouble and defending it was a rather proud moment since I might have normally left it alone.,<strong>Move 19 and 29</strong> &#8211; These moves are worth mentioning again since they were missed opportunities to attack White early on.<br />
3,Shape,<strong>Move 65</strong> &#8211; Getting this shape point allowed me the chance to start gaining the upper hand in this game.,&#8221;<strong>Move 95</strong> &#8211; Though it looks like good shape here, I consider this a bad move since the shape gave me little value on the board as a whole.&#8221;<br />
4,Strategy,<strong>Move 53</strong> &#8211; Trying to remove White’s base in order to attack White seems to be a key moment to why I was able to gain an advantage in the game., <strong>Move 93–95</strong> &#8211; Continuing to try and kill it in such a direct manner however was a mistake.<br />
5,Overall Reading,<strong>Move 271</strong> &#8211; Being able to calmly choose the correct move instead of the automatic move I might have made normally was another proud moment.,<strong>Move 111</strong> &#8211; Connecting here out of fear still shows the immaturity of my reading.<br />
6,Endgame,<strong>Move 143</strong> &#8211; Recognizing that I could start the endgame since I was ahead was something I was unable to do before.,<strong>Move 237</strong> &#8211; Defending directly here was a mistake that gave White three extra points.<br />

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 style="text-align: center;">Introduction</h2>
<p>About a week ago, there was a bit of discussion about the importance of endgame. Now while I would never even begin to propose that endgame is not important or can&#8217;t make a huge difference, I was saying how I didn&#8217;t think studying it would serve kyu players as much as say dan players.<br />
Ironically, the game featured this week was played shortly after the discussion and happened to feature endgame as the shining star of the game. In addition, this game is also a good example of competing moyos and how critical points in shape and boundaries can make a huge difference in the resulting outcome. Hope you enjoy this review!<br />

no,Category,Good,Bad<br />
1,Opening,<strong>Move 11</strong> &#8211; Decisively ignoring White&#8217;s extension to play on the right inside seemed like the correct move.,<strong>Move 35</strong> &#8211; This was a bad move that allowed White to get a nice result on the upper right.<br />
2,Attack and Defense,<strong>Move 111</strong> &#8211; Ignoring White to defend my group was an important step to giving me a chance to make a comeback.,<strong>Move 80</strong> &#8211; Letting White attack my group like this was very painful. It could have been awful if White had continued his attack.<br />
3,Shape,<strong>Move 147</strong> &#8211; Being able to find this point in the midst of near death was another proud moment for me.,<strong>Move 48</strong> &#8211; Letting White get this shape point was unbelievably painful.<br />
4,Strategy,<strong>Move 115</strong> &#8211; Ignoring White&#8217;s approach on my corner to try and reverse the game was importantly to try and reverse the game.,<strong>Move 47</strong> &#8211; Trying to take the corner instead of expanding my moyo was a pretty big mistake.<br />
5,Overall Reading,<strong>Move 151</strong> &#8211; Being able to read out this attachment almost instantly was a proud moment for me.,<strong>Move 63</strong> &#8211; This was so painfully obvious to my opponent. Should have saved it for later.<br />
6,Endgame,<strong>Move 161</strong> &#8211; Taking my sente to connect here is probably what eventually pushed my opponent to resign later.,<strong>Move 86</strong> &#8211; Seeing White fly into my area like that was so painful. It nearly ended the game.<br />

<p>And the funny thing is that this trend seems to be consistent with other things I tried to switch my attention to momentarily (like League of Legends). Part of me wonders whether I&#8217;ve acquired some sort of &#8220;losing&#8221; mindset; but on second though, it&#8217;s rather unlikely since I know that starting off any game being like &#8220;I&#8217;m going to lose anyways&#8221; is a recipe for disaster.<br />
As this is the first day in my quest to return back to my origins, I shouldn&#8217;t be surprised that things are not much different than yesterday. There&#8217;s a big mix of frustration, loss, and clarity all at the time. And to be honest, it feels as if stumbling through the dark blindly reaching for anything I can hold on to to feel like I&#8217;m making progress. I have no idea if it&#8217;s going to get me where I want to go, but it certainly seems to beat standing still.<br />
On the bright side, I&#8217;m glad I&#8217;m not gambling any time soon.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Today I played a game against a 2k as Black (with 45 min main time settings). It&#8217;s been a long time since I&#8217;ve played a game with such long time settings where the opponent actually used up most of his/her time. In fact, it was a little nerve wracking because the quality of the moves were quite different. Far less impulsive ones and much more proper moves that were given a lot of thought. I felt I had decent control of the game for the most part, but started losing control of it towards the later half of the middle game. Around this time, my opponent misclicks.<br />
At first I was thrilled to see the mistake, but then the undo request instantly popped up and I was confronted with the conflicting decision as to wheter I should give him the undo or not. Long story short, he was supposed to gain about 8 points in sente, but misclicked and put his own stones in atari so that I could capture them instead, save my stones, and gain a few points myself.<br />

<p>For 95% of spectators out there, the answer is crystal clear: it was an obvious misclick. In that moment however, though I&#8217;m ashamed to say it, I wanted to win so badly that I tried to brush off his undo and play on. I tried to resolve my cognitive dissonance by telling myself that it was his fault that he misclicked. Not my problem. Within a few moves however, I woke to my senses and realized how pitiful I was being. So I resigned in order to try and pick up what little self-respect I had left.<br />
The reason I&#8217;m writing about this is because I realized I have become too caught up in winning. Even though my name was created with the idea that I had found zen in go, I think that it has become so far from the truth (especially as of late). With each game recently, any sense of calmness or zen has been consistently disturbed by the notion of winning or losing. And with each game, I am concerned that I am losing sight of my go.<br />
This ends now. I don&#8217;t care if I have to drop ten stones to get back to it, but I&#8217;m going to put the pieces that started this blog back together: Ben + Go + Zen.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 style="text-align: center;">Introduction</h2>
<p>This opponent was a unique one since he thought longer than I did and took his time. He actually ended up in byoyomi early on in the game and used most of his byoyomi time which is really weird for Tygem since most players I&#8217;ve encountered play pretty quickly and I&#8217;m the one usually running out of time. Overall though, I felt that I was in control for most of the game. Hopefully you&#8217;ll agree! And if I&#8217;m totally wrong, please let me know!<br />

no,Category,Good,Bad<br />
1,Opening,<strong>Move 9-11</strong>: Ignoring White in the upper left was good in that I did not unnecessarily strengthen my opponent by trying to struggle.,&#8221;Other than the inconsistency of Move 21, I don’t see any egregious errors in regards to the opening.&#8221;<br />
2,Middle Game,<strong>Move 39-63</strong>: It felt like I did a good job attacking White while gaining nice 4th line territory on the right.,Can’t see any major mistakes at the moment.<br />
3,Fighting,Overall the fighting seemed to be in my favor most of the game. Nothing terribly complicated.,Didn’t see any real weaknesses in my fighting this game.<br />
4,Endgame,<strong>Move 219</strong>: Ignoring White’s atari at M1 to make an extra point showed I was not making automatic moves and trying to look for bigger plays.,<strong>Move 164</strong>: Letting what get the diagonal here first was rough.<br />
5,Overall Reading,<strong>Move 121</strong>: I was proud to be able to read out this attachment and know it could not be cut without some loss to White.,<strong>Move 70</strong>: I could sense there was double cut aji here but failed to read it out properly.<br />
6,Strategy,<strong>Move 81</strong>: Sacrificing the F3 group in exchange for breaking up the left side seemed to show good judgment.,&#8221;<strong>Move 21</strong>: Though successful, the 3-3 invasion seems to be contrary to my initial plan at making a moyo. So negative points for inconsistency.&#8221;<br />
