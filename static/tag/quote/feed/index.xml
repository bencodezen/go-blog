				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The first thing I want to write is that I really appreciate the numerous words of support that have been flooding in. It&#8217;s been great to hear from everyone and to hear everyone&#8217;s perspectives on things. In addition, the feedback has helped reassure me that my return to the more journalistic-type blogging was the correct choice.<br />
I&#8217;m not feeling much better today. In fact, in a number of ways I&#8217;m feeling worse due to other things happening in life. However, the one thing I wanted to write about were my thoughts on how I&#8217;ve been dealing with this time of turmoil and downfall.<br />
As most of you suggested, taking a break is certainly one of the most viable options out there. However, there are three reasons why I am taking the high road on this one:</p>
<ol>
<li>Yunguseng Dojang is still a going on (weekly) and the matches will not be stopping just because I&#8217;m in a slump.</li>
<li>Most players I know approach this by taking a break, but I haven&#8217;t heard of anyone try to muscle through it instead and be successful.</li>
<li>I feel a strong determination to try and see this through to the end so I can find out whether or not I&#8217;m delusional or not.</li>
</ol>
<p>Of course, I recognize that my method has a risk of extreme/permanent burnout since I&#8217;m already at a low point; but in case you don&#8217;t know this about me, I&#8217;m quite the risk taker when it comes to these kinds of challenges. So I&#8217;m going to take this slump head on, regardless of what obstacles await me.<br />
And paraphrasing from the new wallpaper on my phone:</p>
<blockquote><p>When things get tough, remember you are tougher.</p></blockquote>
