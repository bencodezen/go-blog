<h2>Thoughts</h2>
<p>I&#8217;m happy to announce that the <a href="http://www.studygroupkyu.org/">StudyGroupKyu</a> site went live this week! There are still some enhancements to be made, and that will continue to take up my time; but it&#8217;s been fun to combine my love for design with go. Definitely hoping to do more of that as time goes on.<br />
With that being said, this week has a decently studious week combined with sporadic blitz go. Now although none of the game time settings will indicate that, I generally didn&#8217;t spend more than 30 seconds on a move. This is probably due to my lack of time and newly acquired ability to not be attached to winning or losing a game. I&#8217;ve been more obsessed with trying out new things and experimenting with what I&#8217;ve been learning. And to be honest, it&#8217;s quite refreshing.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s been a rather light week in terms of playing and studying, but hopefully the Study Group Kyu website will be up and running soon! In addition, starting tomorrow I will be releasing updates and revisions on previous equipment reviews and integrating new reviews as time goes on! So it was still a productive go week even though I didn&#8217;t get to play as much as I would&#8217;ve liked. Here&#8217;s to hoping my schedule will stabilize next week so I can play more ranked games!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So it seems that this week will definitely not be nearly as productive in regards to playing games as last week. Although it will be game light, here are some of the things I am working on:</p>
<ol>
<li><span style="line-height: 13px;">Giving the Equipment section a complete makeover in order to improve the look and feel and to maximize its usefulness to anyone looking to purchase go equipment or books!</span></li>
<li>Designing the first layout for the new <a href="http://studygroupkyutournament.webs.com/">StudyGroupKyu</a> website in preparation for the April tournament launch!</li>
<li>Continuing my study of all the go books I have so that I can add more books to the book review section!</li>
</ol>
<p>I&#8217;ll be sure to post updates when the new Equipment section are updated for your comments and critiques!</p>
