				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Managed to win the first round of Yunguseng Dojang tonight. Contrary to most people&#8217;s expectation however, I&#8217;m not feeling particularly good about it. I don&#8217;t know. Hard to say. Because it feels like to some extend, the games I win I don&#8217;t like, but then the games I felt good about are the ones I ended up losing. But my head has been in a bit of a haze lately, so it&#8217;s hard to say if what I&#8217;m feeling makes any sense at the moment.<br />
What I will say at the moment however, is that I definitely feel like my journey has come to a culmination point where everything seems to be contradicting. In an effort to not play automatic moves and think on a whole board scale, I end up ignoring my instinct to play a move which is actually the proper move that I end up talking myself out of for X reason. Games I win are games I dislike while games I lose are ones that I feel are better. North is south and east is west. Oy vey&#8230;<br />
I imagine that others who have gone through this must find it quite difficult. It definitely seems easier to just throw in the towel instead of subjecting myself to being neck deep in this confusion; but this is the time when I&#8217;m reminded of the quote:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Many of life&#8217;s failures are people who did not realize how close they were to success when they gave up.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8211; Thomas A. Edison<br />
Going to keep calm and maintain my bearings&#8230; Onwards&#8230; Always moving forward&#8230;.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Over the past weekend, I decided to ramp up my activity on Nova.gs for a few reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>I want to support the developers by helping improve their user base and become a part of the founding community.</li>
<li>I was not playing enough games (in real time) and needed some outlet for me to practice applying things I am learning while trying new things out. By doing so, I&#8217;m hoping that my in real time games will become stronger.</li>
<li>As much as correspondence games are harder for me to play since I feel like my thoughts are constantly disjointed, I figured it would help me with practicing constant whole board thinking and positional judgment before each move.</li>
</ol>
<p>In terms of my overall emotions though, I&#8217;m in this weird limbo with go. Normally when people are conflicted on their journey, most might describe it as being at a fork in the road. Recently for me however, I feel as if I&#8217;m standing in a forest while surrounded by a dense fog. There is this sense of stumbling one step at a time without quite knowing where I&#8217;m headed. I&#8217;m trying a lot of different things, but I&#8217;m feeling rather lost in terms of what is holding me back.<br />
To be clear though, this emotion is different from feeling burned out. I still enjoy all the time I spend on go, but I&#8217;m starting to wonder whether any of it is helping me get stronger. But no matter, I just have to have faith in my training regimen and move forward with what I enjoy. As long as I do that, I believe that I&#8217;ll be able to make more sense of this when I finally emerge from this haze.</p>
