				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 style="text-align: center;">Introduction</h2>
<p>I recently had a conversation regarding the importance of ladders. And while the topic of ladders will probably cause many people to roll their eyes at the topic time and time again, it&#8217;s simply one of those things that you keep having a deeper and deeper respect for as you dive into the abyss of go. Today&#8217;s game is short, but it illustrates the severity of not being able to perfectly read out a ladder.<br />
So whether you like it or not, you need to make your peace with ladders and make them your best friend. It&#8217;s the only way to climb to the top!<br />

no,Category,Good,Bad<br />
1,Opening, <strong>Move 10</strong> &#8211; I&#8217;m proud of experimenting with a new joseki move I learned., <strong>Move 34</strong> &#8211; This seems questionable to me; but perhaps it was a necessary defense.<br />
2,Middle Game, <strong>Move 36</strong> &#8211; The sequence around here worked out really well in my favor., <strong>Move 52</strong> &#8211; This was rather small in regards to the whole board.<br />
3,Fighting, <strong>Move 48</strong> &#8211; My confidence in believing I could figure out the upper right corner was a good sign of healthy kiai., &#8220;<strong>Move 54</strong> &#8211; Though I was successful locally, this was small in regards to the whole board.&#8221;<br />
4,Endgame, Not Applicable, Not Applicable<br />
5,Overall Reading, <strong>Move 74</strong> &#8211; Being able to confidently read out this ladder was awesome., <strong>Move 58</strong> &#8211; The sequence around here didn&#8217;t quite work out the way I expected. Didn&#8217;t realize I needed a ladder to be able to really gain a foothold in this area.<br />
