<ol>
<li>Though it may seem like a book about joseki, I feel it&#8217;s more of a book about understanding whole board thinking.</li>
<li>Offers a great opportunity to practice whole board thinking while getting a better understanding of why one move is better or worse in different positions.</li>
<li>Very easy to read and work through.</li>

[expand title=&#8221;Before I Read This Book&#8230;&#8221; trigclass=&#8221;expandTitle&#8221;]
<strong>My Abilities</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Although I&#8217;ve had some exposure to joseki, I have avoided studying them like the plague. I really, really don&#8217;t like studying joseki.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>My Perspective</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Though I was skeptical of the book due to seeing the work joseki, I had heard a lot of good things about this book. In addition, since I was interested in trying to learn more about whole board thinking, I thought this book might be interesting to check out.</li>
</ul>
[/expand]
[expand title=&#8221;My Review&#8221; trigclass=&#8221;expandTitle&#8221; expanded=&#8221;true&#8221;]
<strong>What did I enjoy about the book?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The problems use a multiple choice format to help players like me who don&#8217;t know any joseki.</li>
<li>There are clear and easy to understand explanations for every answer choice that allows the reader to compare and contrast why the correct answer is better than the others.</li>
<li>The problems and solution diagrams are put on completely different pages to prevent the player from accidentally seeing the solution.</li>
<li>The layout of the book was very easy to read. Each section is clearly defined and the book is not cluttered at all.</li>
<li>Though the book seems to be centered on joseki, this seems more like a book on whole board thinking than anything else.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What did I gain from reading this book?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Improved understanding of how certain moves work with the board as a whole.</li>
<li>Reduction in kyu tunnel vision since I have more practice considering the whole board position.</li>
<li>Slightly better understanding of joseki patterns for the 3-4 point, low kakari.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What style of teaching does the book use?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Off the Cliff Style
<ul>
<li>There is no gradual progression into the material.</li>
<li>You learn through trial and error as you progress through the book.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Primary Learning Mechanism:
<ul>
<li>Multiple choice practice problems.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Other Learning Mechanisms:
<ul>
<li>Clear and concise explanations with an accompanying diagram to illustrate his point.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What aspect can be improved on?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>I wish there were more problems! =D But in all seriousness, this book is amazing as it stands. Top notch!</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Is this book easy to read?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Absolutely. The explanations are no longer than a paragraph long and are very clear and concise.</li>
</ul>

<a title="Book Review: 38 Basic Joseki" href="//book-review-38-basic-joseki/">38 Basic Joseki</a>, like most joseki books, actually focuses on teaching the reader about the various sequences from joseki. There is some mention of how they affect the board as a whole, but there is a lack of illustration as to how it is truly impacted. Whole Board Thinking in Joseki, on the other hand, does a perfect job filling this gap.<br />

<strong>My Abilities</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>I&#8217;ve studied my fair share of life and death and can confidently say that I have a SDK (single digit kyu) level of life and death.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>My Perspective</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>In general, I would say that I have always preferred learning through experience. Though in all honesty, after finishing the second volume, I was skeptical of how far I could really get in this book.</li>
</ul>
[/expand]
[expand title=&#8221;My Review&#8221; trigclass=&#8221;expandTitle&#8221; expanded=&#8221;true&#8221;]
<strong>What did I enjoy about the book?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Though my inability to progress very far was slightly depressing, I was happy to see that there was still a lot of room for me to grow and improve my life and death skills.</li>
<li>The drill seargent routine is great because I have multiple opportunities to get exposure to moves I would have never considered before.</li>
<li>There is a huge focus on shapes that players don&#8217;t normally study: rectangular six and 2-2-2. In addition, these shapes are dissected to a very detailed level. Example: Rectangular six with one outside liberty versus two liberties.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What did I gain from reading this book?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A broader perspective on the different variations that can arise from life and death postiions.</li>
<li>A better grasp on techniques used to either kill or save a group.</li>
<li>Moderate improvement in my reading abilities. (This is only due to the speed at which I was going through problems. Anyone who diligently studies each problem to mastery will most likely gain a significant boost to their reading ability).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What style of teaching does the book use?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Curriculum Style
<ul>
<li>Content is organized into lessons, topics, or themes in order to facilitate learning.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Teaching Mechanism:
<ul>
<li>Practice problems</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What aspect can be improved on?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>I felt that the problems got a lot more difficult very quickly. However, this should be taken with a grain of salt since there is a good chance that the reader is supposed to already have a more solid reading ability than I have before working on this book.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Is this book easy to read?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Yes. Unless you can&#8217;t read English, it really doesn&#8217;t get any simpler.</li>
</ul>

[expandsub1 title=&#8221;1001 Life and Death Problems&#8221; trigclass=&#8221;cBookTitle&#8221;]
Compared to <a title="Book Review: 1001 Life and Death Problems" href="//book-review-1001-life-and-death-problems/">1001 Life and Death Problems</a>, this series does a better job hand-holing players new to life and death through the basic shapes and variations. On the other hand, I would say that in terms of polishing a player&#8217;s life and death skills, 1001 Life and Death Problems is still highly recommended. So to clarify, neither one trumps the other. Both can provide great value to a player&#8217;s life and death abilities.<br />

Though they may overlap on a good deal of material, I believe that they complement one another and would both be of great use to serious players wanting to improve their life and death.<br />

<li>You can expect the same quality of problems from the first volume.</li>

<strong>My Abilities</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>I&#8217;ve studied my fair share of life and death and can confidently say that I have a SDK (single digit kyu) level of life and death.</li>

<p><strong>My Perspective</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>After finishing the first volume, I was expecting this book to be rather easy to do as well.</li>

[expand title=&#8221;My Review&#8221; trigclass=&#8221;expandTitle&#8221; expanded=&#8221;true&#8221;]
<strong>What did I enjoy about the book?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>They have no reservation in terms of making you drill the same concept repeatedly.</li>
<li>There are so many concepts and shapes in this book that makes it very valuable.</li>
<li>The review sections (e.g., quizzes) and tests do a great job helping you determine if you actually learned the lessons prior.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What did I gain from reading this book?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A broader perspective on the different variations that can arise from life and death postiions.</li>
<li>A better grasp on techniques used to either kill or save a group.</li>
<li>The problems in this book actually posed some difficulty for me at times. Being that this is the second book, it didn&#8217;t take long for me to realize how weak my life and death skills really are.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What style of teaching does the book use?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Curriculum Style
<ul>
<li>Content is organized into lessons, topics, or themes in order to facilitate learning.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Teaching Mechanism:
<ul>
<li>Practice problems</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What aspect can be improved on?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>If I had to request one thing, it&#8217;s that I was hoping that the difficulty of the problems would be more gradual. The difficulty of the problems increased faster than I was expecting. Though this should be taken with a grain of salt since I have a feeling this is just an indicator of how weak my reading abilities are instead of it being the book&#8217;s problem.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Is this book easy to read?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Yes. Unless you can&#8217;t read English, it really doesn&#8217;t get any simpler.</li>

Compared to <a title="Book Review: 1001 Life and Death Problems" href="//book-review-1001-life-and-death-problems/">1001 Life and Death Problems</a>, this series does a better job hand-holing players new to life and death through the basic shapes and variations. On the other hand, I would say that in terms of polishing a player&#8217;s life and death skills, 1001 Life and Death Problems is still highly recommended. So to clarify, neither one trumps the other. Both can provide great value to a player&#8217;s life and death abilities.<br />

<ol>
<li>Great introduction to tesujis since the chapters are short and the explanations are concise.</li>
<li>Problems are a bit advanced for players learning tesuji, but should be viewed as exposure material instead of a test of knowledge.</li>
<li>Reminds me of an abridged textbook where it covers a lot of material and organized in an intuitive format that helps to give context to the tesujis being presented.</li>

<strong>My Abilities</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>This is my second time reading the book; but besides having a decent grasp of the three most basic tesujis: snapbacks, ladders, and nets, I would have to say that my ability to find tesuji is rather weak.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>My Perspective</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>When I first got this book, I was really hoping to get exposed to a lot of different tesujis along with some context as to how they were being used. For example, this tesuji is good for connecting stones.</li>
</ul>
[/expand]
[expand title=&#8221;My Review&#8221; trigclass=&#8221;expandTitle&#8221; expanded=&#8221;true&#8221;]
<strong>What did I enjoy about the book?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Tesujis are presented in contexts such as &#8220;amputate the cutting stone&#8221; that help to show how tesujis can be utilized for multiple purposes. For example, the squeeze tesuji is presented in both &#8220;amputate the cutting stone&#8221; and &#8220;making shape.&#8221;</li>
<li>The chapters are written in a concise manner with just enough diagrams to make it a short read while illustrating everything very clearly.</li>
<li>There are always practice problems after every tesuji they introduce.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What did I gain from reading this book?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A better grasp on tesujis as a whole.</li>
<li>New ideas regarding how tesujis can be utilized for multiple purposes.</li>
<li>Slightly improved reading ability.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What style of teaching does the book use?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Textbook Approach
<ul>
<li>Organized in a curriculum format that reflects the learning style one might normally find in school.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Primary Learning Mechanism:
<ul>
<li>Explanations with example diagrams</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Other Learning Mechanisms:
<ul>
<li>Practice problems</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What aspect can be improved on?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>I would have liked to see more introductory problems for each tesuji since there was no predicting how complicated the problems would be at the end of each chapter.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Is this book easy to read?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Yes. With its short and concise chapters and explanations, it is usually pretty easy to finish a section within a chapter in 5-10 minutes.</li>
</ul>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Overall Rating: 4 / 5 Ponnuki</h2>
<h3>Basic Information</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Title:</strong> Mastering the Basics, Volume 1 &#8211; Five Hundred and One Opening Problems</li>
<li><strong>Authors: </strong>Richard Bozulich in collaboration with Rob van Zeijst</li>
<li><strong>Publisher: </strong>Kiseido</li>
<li><strong>Publication Date: </strong>August 2002</li>
<li><strong>Page Length:</strong> 256 pages</li>
<li><strong>Number of Problems</strong>: 501</li>
</ul>
<h3>Synopsis</h3>
<ul>
<li>A great basic book about opening problems that utilizes proverbs as directions instead of vague statements.</li>
<li>Appropriate for 10 kyu and stronger.</li>
<li>Recommended for serious players.</li>
</ul>
<p><span id="more-2635"></span></p>
<h3>Detailed Review</h3>
<h4>Readability &#8211; 9 / 10</h4>
<p>The directions and explanations in this book are rather in depth for the number of problems in the book. While it may go over some players&#8217; head if they are not familiar with opening concepts, the explanations are long enough that players of the appropriate level will understand it fully while newer players will at least get some exposure to new ideas.</p>
<h4>Content Quality &#8211; 10 / 10</h4>
<p>One of my favorite aspects about this book is that their directions consist of principles like &#8220;Neutralize your opponent&#8217;s thickness while establishing a base for yourself&#8221; in order to give you a better idea of how to approach the problem. There are more principles than I can count on both hands and they are applied to a number of different scenarios. As a result, this book earns a perfect score since the reader is forced to think strategically in addition to figuring out the right move.</p>
<h4>Final Thoughts</h4>
<p>Since this book is part of the series geared toward helping players master the basics, I have found that <em>Five Hundred and One Opening Problems</em> does a great job exposing the player to a lot of different opening concepts and principles. I personally wish there was a bit more structure as to helping the players truly grasp each principle before moving on to other principles, but it is a great start for any player looking to get a better understanding of the opening.</p>
