				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I recently finished <em>Master Play: The Style of Go Seigen</em> (Review coming soon!), and it has really given me a lot to think about in regards to the way I play go.<br />
For starters, though I&#8217;ve been familiar with the concept of professionals ignoring an area when there just aren&#8217;t any good moves to play, it wasn&#8217;t until I saw Go Seigen&#8217;s games till I realized how true this really was. In fact, not only did Go Seigen constantly resist giving in to his opponents; but he would also not hesitate to trade large sections of the board! And what made it even more mind-blowing, was that these areas he would sacrifice were places that were only a few moves away from solid territory!<br />
With that vivid illustration in mind, I couldn&#8217;t help but start to notice how stubborn kyu players get about hanging onto stones or territory. It&#8217;s as if once they&#8217;ve made a decision (i.e., I have declared the right side to be mine!), they will defend it to the end regardless of the fact that they are losing. Another example of this is I&#8217;ve noticed is: &#8220;Oh look, I&#8217;ve spent the time to play three stones here, even though they are now strategically useless, I must save it at all cost even though I will let my opponent walk right into my territory!&#8221; Granted, I realize that you must understand strategy and such to be able to walk away from some groups, but this seems to be a general trend that I&#8217;ve noticed.<br />
In addition, I think I may have started to internalize the idea of, &#8220;If you can&#8217;t find a good move, play somewhere else.&#8221; In other words, seeing Go Seigen&#8217;s game for the first time has really shocked me into realizing how much freedom there really is on the go board. Although a sequence might be considered sente or an area might seem large, it may not actually be from a whole board perspective or from another player&#8217;s strategy.<br />
I keep trying to bring this post to a nice closing statement, but it seems that this post is destined for random ramblings. It&#8217;s still a whirlwind of thoughts and emotions that I&#8217;m sorting through, but I guess that&#8217;s one of the benefits of having a blog right? A way for me to dump my thoughts and attempt to sort it out in the process. xD<br />

On an entirely different note, in case you haven&#8217;t heard about it, the <a href="http://www.usgo.org/">American Go Association (AGA)</a>Â has taken a big step towards establishing a presence online. Starting in October, there will be an <a href="http://www.usgo.org/news/2013/09/expanding-online-efforts-aga-launches-on-line-self-paired-tourney-on-kgs/">AGA Online Tournament</a> that will be used to help gather information and help them figure out the right way to proceed with online games in the future. And yes, I have already signed up! For more information, check out their post <a href="http://www.usgo.org/news/2013/09/expanding-online-efforts-aga-launches-on-line-self-paired-tourney-on-kgs/">here</a>.</p>
