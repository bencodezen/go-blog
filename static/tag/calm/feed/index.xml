				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 style="text-align: center;">Introduction</h2>
<p>With this week, we continue on with Game #4 of Maaike&#8217;s <a title="Maaike's April Challenge" href="http://www.thegochallenge.blogspot.com.au/2014/04/april-challenge.html">April Challenge</a>, which also happens to be the first round of the <a title="1st Washington Open Baduk Championship — Part I" href="//1st-washington-open-baduk-championship-part/">1st Washington Open Baduk Championship</a> that I participated in a month or so ago. Though it ended up being a completely crazy roller coaster of a match, it is an excellent example of how volatile games can be in tournaments. Because of the pressure of competition, players will look for any slack move or advantage they can to reverse the game. With that said, hang on to your seats cause this is going to be a bumpy one!<br />

<p style="text-align: center;">When your group is weak, check to see if your opponent has any weak groups that you can counter attack instead of simply trying to run or make life.</p>

<p>With this week, we continue on with Game #2 of Maaike&#8217;s <a title="Maaike's April Challenge" href="http://www.thegochallenge.blogspot.com.au/2014/04/april-challenge.html">April Challenge</a>! Even though the game ended up culminating into a rather large capturing race, I felt that my decisions leading up to it were calm as a whole. Instead of trying to turn it into a capturing race from the beginning, there were a number of times when I would offer the possibility of a peaceful resolution. So in that regard, I believe that I was successful in playing a calm game. Hopefully you&#8217;ll think so too!<br />

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Master Play: The Style of Lee Changho</h2>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> In the first volume of Yuan Zhou&#8217;s series &#8220;Master Play,&#8221; Zhou provides amateur players with insight into the legendary Lee Changho. Zhou provides two in-depth commentaries on two of Lee Changho&#8217;s games to illustrate Lee Changho&#8217;s brilliance and why his famous &#8220;calm and solid&#8221; style it is so effective. Very useful for kyu players who find themselves consistently in violent games.<br />

[expand title=&#8221;Before I Read This Book&#8230;&#8221; trigclass=&#8221;expandTitle&#8221;]
When I first started learning about modern day go professionals, it&#8217;s to no one&#8217;s surprise that one of the first names I came upon was Lee Changho. Not only was he extremely famous, but it seemed he was undisputedly #1 at the time (although he might have started dropping ranks by the time I learned about him). So it goes without saying that I was curious what made him so strong, and thus it led me to purchasing this book.<br />
[/expand]
[expand title=&#8221;My Review&#8221; trigclass=&#8221;expandTitle&#8221; expanded=&#8221;true&#8221;]
Similar to Master Style of Play: Go Seigen, you are initially greeted with a fun little dialogue between Yuan Zhou and two amateur players to give an introduction on Lee Changho and his background. After a couple of pages of this, Zhou then dives right into the game reviews.<br />
One of the things that I enjoyed about the game diagrams in this book is that they are often only a couple moves long. This makes it a lot easier to follow what is going on and allows weaker players to have a chance to understand what is going on. In addition, the variations are kept to a minimum in order to keep a focus on Lee Changho&#8217;s style instead of go theory and technique.<br />
Upon finishing both game commentaries, I am glad that I finally took the time to gain insight into Lee Changho&#8217;s style. It&#8217;s quite simple and straightforward when compared to Go Seigen, but it is one of the more appropriate styles that I feel kyu players should check out first. This is because Lee Changho&#8217;s games convey the prime example of how one does not have to risk battles of epic proportions to win games, which is something I think many kyu players never take the time to learn or realize.<br />
At the end of the day, this is a book that is best suited for those looking to get a glimpse into Lee Changho&#8217;s style and what it means to play calm go. Definitely recommended for kyu players.<br />

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 style="text-align: center;">Friday Go Forward: Week 25</h2>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Having nearly burned out after my last couple weeks of intensive study, I&#8217;ve scaled back on the study and refocused all of my energy on the Level Up Series. I have plans to slowly scale up to a more balanced regimen, but for now this seems to be working for me. Overall though, this week has been pretty calm. Nothing too crazy. The most memorable part was being able to attend the monthly go workshop. Otherwise though, just moving forward one step at a time&#8230;</p>
<h2>Games</h2>
<ul>
<li>KGS &#8211; 1 game</li>
<li>DGS &#8211; 3 ongoing games</li>
<li>Nova &#8211; 3 ongoing games</li>
</ul>
<h2>Education &amp; Training</h2>
<ul>
<li><em></em>Started and finished <em>Level Up 7</em>.<em><br />
</em></li>
<li>Started and finished <em>Level Up 8</em>.</li>
<li>Started and finished <i>Level Up 9.</i></li>
<li>Started working on <em>Level Up 10</em>.</li>
<li>Working on <em>Mastering the Basics, Vol. 8 &#8211; Fight Like a Pro</em>.</li>
<li>Started reading <em>Lessons in the Fundamentals of Go </em>again.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Lesson Learned</h2>
<ol>
<li>Focus on each game by trying to make the best move on a whole board scale.</li>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Over the last few days, something that has been bothering me is the fact that my rank graph has completely plateaued. While I know that I can match stronger opponents in even games sometimes, it was bothering me that I did not have the rank to show for it.<br />
After some thought though, I have realized that my anxiety at letting KGS define my strength is rather stupid. First of all, I just don&#8217;t have enough time to play the ranked games required to possibly show whatever improvements that I may have gained. On top of that, it&#8217;s not as if KGS&#8217; ranking equation is the best in the world. So with that in mind, what am I worried about?<br />
In addition, I&#8217;ve also come to terms that my style has always been more of a wild fighting style. It&#8217;s not that I was never interested in the calculated wins where the win margin was 10 points or less; but my style always led to games that would be decided by 30 points or more. In fact, I think I continued playing that way in order to avoid actually counting since the advantage would be so clear there would be no need to count.<br />
And so, regardless of the fact that I may be a KGS 5k for some time, I have decided to play all of my opponents with my weakest style from now on: calm and calculated. (Don&#8217;t get me wrong. If the opponent offers an opportunity for me to strike, I will unleash a tornado of fury upon them.) I will lose a lot, but I have a feeling that this is my biggest obstacle before I leave the world of kyus.<br />
Watch out shodans. I&#8217;ll be knocking at your door before you know it.</p>
