				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 style="text-align: center;">Introduction</h2>
<p>For today&#8217;s go meditation, I am featuring an opponent who was rather unique. Before he accepted my challenge, the first thing he asked was, &#8220;Do you play fast?&#8221; And the reason this is significant is because it launches us into a discussion during the game about kyu players&#8217; tendency to make automatic responses. And after some back and forth, I suddenly felt very compelled to not make any automatic responses. So in a number of ways, I definitely have to thank my opponent for forcing me to raise the level of my game by slowing down. In addition, though I was a bit saddened by the fact that I lost after having a commanding position, I definitely learned a lot from it and have no regrets.<a href="//wp-content/uploads/2013/08/2013.08.05-MGM-21.sgf"><br />

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>In case it wasn&#8217;t apparent to everyone, this week has been entirely centered around boxing analogies along with handicap go. There hasn&#8217;t been as many ranked games as I might have liked, but the amount of go I&#8217;ve been playing/studying seems to be harmonizing much better with the rest of my life. Still fine tuning a number of things, but just glad to not feel overwhelemed by go anymore.</p>
<h2>Games</h2>
<ul>
<li><span style="line-height: 13px;">KGS &#8211; 2 games (2 wins : 0 losses)</span></li>
<li>DGS &#8211; 2 ongoing games</li>
<li>Nova &#8211; 3 ongoing games</li>
</ul>
<h2>Training</h2>
<ul>
<li><span style="line-height: 13px;">20 tsumego problems each day.</span></li>
<li>Worked <em>Mastering the Basics: The Basics of Go Strategy</em>.</li>
<li>Started reading <em>Kage&#8217;s Secret Chronicles of Handicap Go.</em></li>
</ul>
<h2>Lessons Learned</h2>
<ol>
<li>When attacking, strike at the vital points while maintaining strength and not overextending yourself.</li>
<li>It&#8217;s okay to let things live or give your opponents points, as long as you are getting more in return.</li>
<li>Don&#8217;t over think your moves in turn based go. Rather than spend hours staring at the screen trying to make the perfect move, you will learn and gain more by playing more games and learning from your mistakes.</li>
</ol>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Lately I have been on a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fighting_Spirit_(manga)">Hajime no Ippo</a> kick and can&#8217;t seem to put it down. With each match that I read, I&#8217;m severely reminded of how much they endure in order to be crowned the victor at the end of each match. Of course, some of their battles are won in a one round KO; but for the most part, the victor rarely comes out unscathed and is often sweating profusely and breathing heavily when holding is victory pose.<br />
Being the go player that I am, I couldn&#8217;t help but draw connections between the two sports (albeit physical vs. mental, but you get my point). Too often, I have found that players are often looking for the easy win. The one-sided match where only a miracle might possibly save the opponent. And I&#8217;ll be honest, I have been and still am (to some degree) guilty of that. After all, it feels good when you&#8217;re knocking your opponent around and in full control of the game.<br />
However, the pursuit of that type of dominating game is unhealthy for a go player. More often than not, the constant attempt at trying to throw that KO punch will be met with a timely counter that reverses the position and knocks you out before you know it. It is a terrible mindset that will only corrode your go as time goes on.<br />
Instead, we must strive to be patient. Use your strengths and strike while maintaining a manageable level of risk. Endure your opponents attacks and the dips that will inevitably come with most games. All you need to remember, as you parry the board against your opponent, is that you don&#8217;t need to win by KO or by 30 points. You only need <strong>half a point</strong> to be the victor.</p>
