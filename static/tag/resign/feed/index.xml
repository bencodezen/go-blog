				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>For this week&#8217;s meditation, we are going to start off nice and easy with a 9&#215;9 game I played on GoQuest a week or so ago. It&#8217;s not too crazy in regards to fighting, but is a great example of how powerful influence can be on such a small board. Hope that you enjoy the game and the commentary!<br />

<h2 style="text-align: left;">One Point Lesson</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Never hesitate to take influence early on when playing on a small board, it is more powerful than you probably realize.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hey everyone. Just wanted to let you know I&#8217;m still alive and well. Been getting into some really interesting projects these past few weeks and have been really pondering what I can do with blogging again since I miss doing it. And as someone who hates it when a regular blogger just drops out of the blogosphere, you can rest assured that I won&#8217;t ever just leave the blog hanging in the event I need to close up shop for awhile.<br />
In terms of what I&#8217;ve been up to, I&#8217;ve been tinkering again with daily regimens and playing games via <a title="Dragon Go Server" href="http://www.dragongoserver.net/">DGS</a> and <a title="Online Go Server" href="http://www.online-go.com/">OGS</a> while concurrently juggling a new job and trying to learn a ton of new skills. I&#8217;ve gone all the way back down to the very basics of doing only 10 life and death problems a day. They&#8217;re not hard in any sense of the word, but they help me to keep a connection to the world of go.<br />
And as a special treat for those who miss my reviews, I&#8217;ve decided to try reviewing one of my 9&#215;9 games that I played recently on GoQuest via an awesome new social kifu reviewing software called <a title="GoKibitz" href="http://www.gokibitz.com/">GoKibitz</a> that a close friend and long time rival built himself. So I hope you enjoy the review and I will try and post again soon!<br />
UPDATE: Apparently all my comments got lost in the abyss of the internet&#8230;. Oy vey&#8230; I&#8217;ll try and get another version up soon&#8230;.<br />

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 style="text-align: left;">Introduction</h2>
<p>For this week’s meditation, we are turning back the clock to my first game at the <a title="Go Congress 2014 — Prelude" href="//go-congress-2014-prelude/">U.S. Go Congress</a>! For those who need a refresher, this game was from the day I arrived in New York and was asked to play a match while we were waiting for people to arrive. It’s a fun game that shows just how you can find the opportunity to reverse a game if you’re willing to roll up your sleeves and complicate things. Hope you enjoy this game!<br />

<p>As the weeks have passed, one of the major factors in me starting to play go again has been the numerous friends who have been kind enough to take time out of their day and ask me to play. Just like last week’s MGM, this week’s MGM features teafree. It’s an exciting one that is chocked full of ko battles and exciting exchanges. I hope that it keeps you on the edge of your seat as we navigate through the treacherous waters of this kifu! Enjoy!<br />

1,Opening, Move 40 &#8211; I like this move since it was dual purpose as reinforcement and an extension.,&#8221;Move 10 &#8211; Though some might say that White ended up okay, I really did not like the result for White.&#8221;<br />
2,Attack and Defense, Nothing worth mentioning., Move 22 &#8211; Neglecting my corner for this pincer is questionable.<br />
3,Shape, N/A, Move 251 &#8211; I did not anticipate the ko shape here.<br />
4,Strategy, Move 146 &#8211; I was proud of being able to switch strategies once I realized my mistake., Move 92 &#8211; This was too greedy on my part and helped Black more than White.<br />
5,Overall Reading, Move 60 &#8211; Being able to discern this move out during the game gave me the advantage early on., Move 210 &#8211; Should have realized Black was already dead.<br />
6,Endgame, Move 262-264 &#8211; This was a nice sequence to capture a bigger corner., Move 286 &#8211; This was a useless connection.<br />

<h2>Prologue</h2>
<p>Hey everyone. I’m glad to finally be able get Monday Go Meditation back up and running again. In a concerted effort to being consistent and making progress one step at a time, here is my revised philosophy on MGM:<br />
For those who remember, I eventually got caught up in trying to make MGM reflective of my actual progress and tried to keep all the game commentary as current as possible. However, I’ve come to learn that this was something I could not keep up with. So rather than abandon the effort all together, I will try and keep the game commentaries as current as I can; but no promises on it being in perfect sync with my actual progress.<br />
With that said, I’m looking forward to your insights on my games and all the great discussions to come!</p>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>The following game is one that I had the pleasure of playing last week thanks for Daurak. I still have some reservations about playing games, so it’s helpful to have friends who ask to play games. And just to clarify, our ranks are not accurate at the moment; so we went ahead and played an even game (although I think we accidentally did no komi).<br />
Hope you enjoy the game!<br />

<h2>One Point Lesson</h2>
<p>Pay attention to cutting points and weaknesses for yourself and your opponent. Doing so will often yield strategies that can lead to victory.</p>

1,Opening,<strong>Move 19</strong> &#8211; Recognizing the big point was critical in gaining the upper hand in the moyo race.,<strong>Move 39</strong> &#8211; This was too greedy. I should have just enclosed the corner.<br />
2,Attack and Defense, <strong>Move 99</strong> &#8211; Getting this allowed me to get the attack needed to maintain my lead., Nothing glaring as far as I can tell.<br />
3,Shape,<strong>Move 47</strong> &#8211; This move I made purely from shape knowledge.,<strong>Move 93</strong> &#8211; I wonder if there’s a better response; but I ended up with bad shape after the peep.<br />
4,Strategy, Overall I felt I was pretty consistent for the game.,<strong>Move 39</strong> &#8211; Must be reiterated for its greediness.<br />
5,Overall Reading,<strong>Move 129-133</strong> &#8211; Reading out the aji was a proud moment for me.,<strong>Move 58-69</strong> &#8211; I didn’t realized White would be able to connect so easily.<br />

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 style="text-align: center;">Introduction</h2>
<p>I recently had a conversation regarding the importance of ladders. And while the topic of ladders will probably cause many people to roll their eyes at the topic time and time again, it&#8217;s simply one of those things that you keep having a deeper and deeper respect for as you dive into the abyss of go. Today&#8217;s game is short, but it illustrates the severity of not being able to perfectly read out a ladder.<br />
So whether you like it or not, you need to make your peace with ladders and make them your best friend. It&#8217;s the only way to climb to the top!<br />

1,Opening, <strong>Move 10</strong> &#8211; I&#8217;m proud of experimenting with a new joseki move I learned., <strong>Move 34</strong> &#8211; This seems questionable to me; but perhaps it was a necessary defense.<br />
2,Middle Game, <strong>Move 36</strong> &#8211; The sequence around here worked out really well in my favor., <strong>Move 52</strong> &#8211; This was rather small in regards to the whole board.<br />
3,Fighting, <strong>Move 48</strong> &#8211; My confidence in believing I could figure out the upper right corner was a good sign of healthy kiai., &#8220;<strong>Move 54</strong> &#8211; Though I was successful locally, this was small in regards to the whole board.&#8221;<br />
4,Endgame, Not Applicable, Not Applicable<br />
5,Overall Reading, <strong>Move 74</strong> &#8211; Being able to confidently read out this ladder was awesome., <strong>Move 58</strong> &#8211; The sequence around here didn&#8217;t quite work out the way I expected. Didn&#8217;t realize I needed a ladder to be able to really gain a foothold in this area.<br />

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 style="text-align: center;">Introduction</h2>
<p>Before playing this game, I had been studying one of Seo Bong Soo&#8217;s games from <a title="Book Review: The Fighting Styles of Kato Masao and Seo Bong Soo" href="//book-review-fighting-styles-kato-masao-seo-bong-soo/">Master Play: The Fighting Styles of Kato Masao and Seo Bong Soo</a>. And as I was replaying his game against Otake Hideo, I couldn&#8217;t help but wonder whether or not I had been wrong about my style of go this entire time. After all, I always thought I had a fighting style; but perhaps that is not really the case.<br />
Anyways, inspired by his game, I decided to try and imitate that same feeling in this game. And though I end up collapsing in on myself with a really basic reading mistake, I hope you&#8217;ll still find this game entertaining.<br />

no,Category,Good,Bad<br />
1,Opening,Overall it felt okay considering it was a non-traditional opening; but nothing spectacular.,<strong>Move 28: </strong>This may have been too slow. Giving Black the initiative on the lower left was rough.<br />
2,Middle Game,It felt more or less in my favor; but a bit risky.,Black got a big left side which sort of forced me to try and kill his group.<br />
3,Fighting,<strong>Move 38:</strong> I was proud of starting this fight since I had an advantage in this area.,<strong>Move 98:</strong> This is probably my losing move. Letting my stones get weakened like that was bad.<br />
4,Endgame,Not Applicable,Not Applicable<br />
5,Overall Reading,<strong>Move 74-97:</strong> Felt proud for being able to continually harass this group / almost killing it.,<strong>Move 106:</strong> No excuses for this move. Complete misread.<br />

<p>For this week&#8217;s meditation, I am happy to feature fellow go blogger <a title="Kingdom of Baduk" href="http://kingdomofbaduk.blogspot.fr/">Pericles</a> to this series. The game below is a casual game that we played with one another and can in fact be seen as a teaching game of sorts. As Pericles is a 5-6 dan, you can predict the outcome pretty well; but I&#8217;m hoping that you&#8217;ll find the kifu entertaining as I try to flail around the board against his mighty strength. Enjoy!<br />

<p>For this week&#8217;s meditation, I am featuring the first game I played after coming back from Hong Kong. It had been awhile since I last played, so I was feeling a little nervous about playing poorly. Fortunately for me though, my opponent accepted my challenge before I could chicken out and cancel my challenge.<br />
If there&#8217;s one thing I will say about this game though, it is that I was spending a lot less time second guessing myself regarding my reading. Definitely have the trip to thank for that. This game was certainly a testament to how your reading abilities allow you to make better moves easily since it takes much less effort to read out the variations. Thank you once again Hong Kong trip.<br />
Finally, this game&#8217;s play style was inspired by my sensei who told me one way to play is to simply ignore your opponent and play what you want. Obviously this should not be taken literally, but you&#8217;ll see how it influences this game. Hope that you&#8217;ll enjoy this crazy game full of fighting and an opponent who makes the most outrageous overplays in hopes that I will make an epic mistake!<br />

<p>For today&#8217;s go meditation, I am happy to feature a new player to the reviews: RisingStar! At his request, I will be going through an even game that I played with him recently. Overall, RisingStar played very well and surprised me numerous times with his decisions to take critical points and to give me an easy win. In fact, I would have to say that there were a number of times where I was at a rather disadvantageous position and might have lost if he had just been a bit more aggressive. Nonetheless, a job well done to RisingStar and I hope that you enjoy this review! <a href="//wp-content/uploads/2013/08/2013.08.05-MGM-21.sgf"><br />

<h2 style="text-align: center;"><strong>One Point Lesson</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: center;">Be careful not to get caught up in small plays that have little to no significance on the board. Otherwise, you will give your opponents a lot of opportunities to change the flow of the game.</p>
