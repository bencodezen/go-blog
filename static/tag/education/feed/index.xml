[expand title=&#8221;Before I Read This Book&#8230;&#8221; trigclass=&#8221;expandTitle&#8221;]
As a mid to high SDK (i.e., single digit kyu) player, I was expecting to see the same quality of content from previous volumes. In addition, I was hoping that I would be able to solve most problems with relative ease while finding some problems challenging.<br />
[/expand]
[expand title=&#8221;My Review&#8221; trigclass=&#8221;expandTitle&#8221; expanded=&#8221;true&#8221;]
This volume starts with a skill that I believe many players are lazy about: counting liberties. And to be honest, I did not realize how much I would have to struggle through this section. It wasn&#8217;t until I started working through these problems that I realized how lazy I&#8217;ve been and how weak I am at this fundamental skill. Though a bit of a shock, it was a good reminder of how weak my basics are.<br />
In this volume, a new problem type is introduced: profiting from your opponent&#8217;s overplays. This was by far one of the most surprising and enjoyable sections in the book since very little practice is ever given to players for this. Stronger players constantly tell weaker players to learn how to punish overplays, but there has been little material to focus on how to do so. Up till this book, I always found that learning to punish overplays came from experience and nothing else. Well, this section is that something else.<br />
Another thing that I noticed in this book is the categorization of life and death problems based on techniques. Most of the life and death books I have encountered thus far generally just include an assortment of problems, but I think that the categorization of problems based on technique is one of the more effective ways to teach players from the ground up. I definitely am hoping to see more of this in the future.<br />
And as if I wasn&#8217;t already impressed enough with this volume, they also take great care to teach the foundation behind the usage of certain moves or techniques. For example, many of us are familiar with what snapback is, but we don&#8217;t really get much training in regards to making the snapback. Another example would be practicing the double hane. Most players learn that it&#8217;s a useful move, but players are often forced to guess and learn the hard way in the middle of their game. And that can be painfully slow if you are only playing occassionally and do not have guidance at all.<br />
Finally, though it feels a little late in the series to finally see this, I&#8217;m really glad that they have a section devoted to training basic sente and gote understanding. Players can practice what I consider the most fundamental endgame problem: Find the sente endgame move. You might scoff at how simple that sounds, but I cannot count how many times I&#8217;ve seen kyu players just blatantly ignore sente plays for gote ones.<br />
Bottom line: Though I didn&#8217;t think they could improve the series much more, this volume just goes to show how well Lee Jae-Hwan understands breaking down the fundamentals of go into understable bite size pieces. Highly recommended!<br />
[/expand]
[expand title=&#8221;Synopsis&#8221; trigclass=&#8221;expandTitle&#8221;]
<strong>What did I enjoy about the book?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Forces players to understand counting liberties in capturing races.</li>
<li>Focuses on how to punish overplays that players commonly make.</li>
<li>Trains players on how to properly utilize moves like double hane.</li>
<li>Introduces sente and gote in an easy to understand manner.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What did I gain from reading this book?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Realization of how weak my liberty counting abilities are. They are stronger now, but I know that I still have a bit to go before I am confident in them.</li>
<li>Better understanding of how to use the double hane.</li>
<li>Sharpened intuition for utilizing tesuji like snapback and shortage of liberties.</li>
<li>Reinforced understanding of the foundation of endgame plays.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What is the format of the book?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The book is primarily structured as follows:
<ul>
<li>(1) A one page explanation of the topic that you are about to practice. Example: When behind in liberties. They not only show the sequence for the proper technique, but also include common mistakes and brief explanations as to why they are mistakes.</li>
<li>(2) A set of very easy to understand and follow practice problems to ensure you understand what you are learning.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What aspect can be improved on?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Page 145 &#8211; Directions should read: Black to play a sente move.</li>
<li>Page 162: Problem #20 &#8211; The solution in the answer book is technically correct in that it&#8217;s the best endgame sequence. However, it fails to what the problem is asking for (i.e., A, B, or C) since it chooses D (which does not exist in the book). For those who are looking for the simple answer, it is A.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Is this book easy to read?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Yes. It doesn&#8217;t get much more simple or straightforward than this.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Bottom Line</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Continues to live up to the quality of content you come to expect from this series.</li>
<li>Provides excellent practice for concepts many players overlook (e.g., counting liberties).</li>
<li>Completely worth your time and money!</li>
</ol>
[/expand]
[expand title=&#8221;Recommended For&#8230;&#8221; trigclass=&#8221;expandTitle&#8221;]
<ul>
<li>Though the series is designed for kids, both kids and adults alike will be able to learn everything they need to know about playing go in a fun and entertaining way.</li>
<li>People who enjoy learning things in an easy to understand format and lots of opportunities to reinforce what they are learning.</li>

<ol>
<li>It continues to amaze me how they REALLY drill even the most rudimentary concepts like making real eyes or falsifying an eye. No wonder Korean players are so well known for their reading abilities.</li>
<li>As we are now in the second half of the series, I think it has done a great job starting to pick up speed in terms of complexity of the problems while still focusing on the fundamentals.</li>
<li>Even though I never even thought about endgame when I first started learning the game, they already start introducing it in volume 6.</li>
</ol>
[/expand]
[expand title=&#8221;Before I Read This Book&#8230;&#8221; trigclass=&#8221;expandTitle&#8221;]
<strong>My Abilities</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A mid to high SDK (single digit kyu) kyu who has read his fair share of go books and has a pretty strong foundation in the basics and teaching go.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>My Perspective</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Since I was able to complete the first half of the series without much difficulty, I was expecting this to be start increasing in difficulty but still remain pretty easy to work through.</li>
</ul>
[/expand]
[expand title=&#8221;My Review&#8221; trigclass=&#8221;expandTitle&#8221; expanded=&#8221;true&#8221;]
<strong>What did I enjoy about the book?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Even though concepts like false eyes and snapback have been introduced and practiced quite repetitively in the first five volumes, they have no hesitation to continue drilling these concepts and ensuring that they truly become second nature.</li>
<li>They already start to introduce endgame! This blew my mind since I didn&#8217;t even both with endgame until much later on in my journey as a player.</li>
<li>It really starts to break down why certain moves are considered proper. For example, the rationale behind extending after being kicked is to play on the opponent&#8217;s vital point.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What did I gain from reading this book?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Polishing fundamental reading and analysis abilities.</li>
<li>A better understanding of why certain moves are the considered the proper response.</li>
<li>Feeling a little bit more comfortable with calculating the value of endgame moves.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What style of teaching does the book use?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Curriculum Style
<ul>
<li>Content is organized into lessons, topics, or themes in order to facilitate learning.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Primary Learning Mechanism:
<ul>
<li>Practice problems</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Other Learning Mechanisms:
<ul>
<li>Cute and entertaining comics to teach and/or reinforce lessons.</li>
<li>Simple explantations that are accompanied by equally simple diagrams.</li>
<li>Samples of openings from professional games to further acclimate the reader to full games on a 19&#215;19 board.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What aspect can be improved on?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>This is just a frivolous request, but I would&#8217;ve liked to have seen a few more endgame counting questions.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Is this book easy to read?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Yes. Other than the occasional article, the explanations are very easy short and easy to understand.</li>

<strong>My Abilities</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A mid to high SDK (single digit kyu) kyu who has read his fair share of go books and has a pretty strong foundation in the basics and teaching go.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>My Perspective</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>After Level Up 3, I was expecting things to start to start getting more difficult; but hopefully still manageable.</li>
</ul>
[/expand]
[expand title=&#8221;My Review&#8221; trigclass=&#8221;expandTitle&#8221; expanded=&#8221;true&#8221;]
<strong>What did I enjoy about the book?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>I enjoyed that they use &#8220;next move&#8221; questions that provide a mini-simulation of what kind of decisions you might make in a game.</li>
<li>When drilling life and death shapes, they spare no effort in making sure you not only know where the vital point of the shape is, but how to create the shape when killing your opponent or avoiding offering the opponent a chance to create the shape.</li>
<li>Does a great job introducing dame (aka neutral) points and giving the reader opportunities to practice finding them along with how to be careful about how accidentally filling the wrong dame points can actually cause problems.</li>
<li>Introduces &#8220;endgame&#8221; at its most basic level: closing off or reducing territory.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What did I gain from reading this book?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Continued polishing my reading abilities &#8211; particularly shortage of liberties and nets.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What style of teaching does the book use?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Curriculum Style
<ul>
<li>Content is organized into lessons, topics, or themes in order to facilitate learning.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Primary Learning Mechanism:
<ul>
<li>Practice problems.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Other Learning Mechanisms:
<ul>
<li>Simple explanations accompanied by equally simple diagrams.</li>
<li>Fun comics to help explain concepts like the net.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What aspect can be improved on?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Up to this point, the answer books have been great on its own. For this book however, I noticed that there were times where answers to questions that asked the reader &#8220;Which direction to block?&#8221; would be best served if there were a short explanation as to why. Granted, this may be omitted due to it being used in a school setting where a go teacher would explain it; but if the answer books are intended to be sufficient without a teacher, then this would be very helpful.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Is this book easy to read?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Yes. It was very easy to understand all the explanations and progress through the book.</li>
</ul>
[/expand]
[expand title=&#8221;Recommended For&#8230;&#8221; trigclass=&#8221;expandTitle&#8221;]
<ul>
<li>Though the series is designed for kids, both kids and adults alike will be able to learn everything they need to know about playing go in a fun and entertaining way.</li>
<li>People who enjoy learning things in an easy to understand format and lots of opportunities to reinforce what they are learning.</li>

[expand title=&#8221;Synopsis&#8221; trigclass=&#8221;expandTitle&#8221;Â expanded=&#8221;true&#8221;]
<ol>
<li>The best introductory book that I have encountered thus far.</li>
<li>Imagine one of those practice workbooks you used to have in school, except about go.</li>
<li>Does a fantastic job giving the reader lots of opportunity to reinforce the concepts they learn.</li>
</ol>
[/expand]
[expand title=&#8221;Before I Read This Book&#8230;&#8221; trigclass=&#8221;expandTitle&#8221;]
<strong>My Abilities</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A 5 kyu who has read his fair share of go books and has a pretty strong foundation in the basics and teaching go.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>My Perspective</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>I was looking for a series that could fill the missing niche of breaking down concepts in an easy to understand manner while giving lots of opportunity to practice what they just learned.</li>
</ul>
[/expand]
[expand title=&#8221;My Review&#8221; trigclass=&#8221;expandTitle&#8221;Â expanded=&#8221;true&#8221;]
<strong>What did I enjoy about the book?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The diagrams and explanations are very simple and very easy to follow, which is ideal for new players.</li>
<li>There are lots of opportunity to reinforce the concept being taught regardless of how &#8220;easy&#8221; it is.</li>
<li>It is very evident that a lot of effort went into structuring the content like a curriculum so that it builds upon previous concepts as the reader progresses.</li>
<li>They do a great job with acclimating the reader to more complicated diagrams. For example, the first capture scenarios literally only involve one group. Next round, they add some miscellaneous stones to the diagram while still marking the important stones to start acclimating the reader to seeing more complicated diagrams. Love it.</li>
<li>Though the book is designed for kids, both kids and adults alike will be able to learn everything they need to know about playing go in a fun and entertaining way.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What did I gain from reading this book?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Even though I already know all of these concepts, forcing myself to go through the book from start to finish was a great way for me to ensure that my reading abilities were 100% with even the most basic problems.</li>
<li>The school and workbook-like approach to teaching go has definitely helped me improve the way that I will be teaching go in the future.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What style of teaching does the book use?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Workbook Approach
<ul>
<li>They introduce concepts within one to two lines with diagrams to support them.</li>
<li>Once they introduce a concept, they provide multiple opportunities for practice.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Primary Teaching Mechanism:
<ul>
<li>Solving simple and easy problems.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Other Teaching Mechanisms:
<ul>
<li>Explanations with really easy multiple choice questions.</li>
<li>Kifus (i.e., game records) that are only around 10 moves long with short one line statements of the move&#8217;s purpose.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What aspect(s) can be improved on?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Sometimes the directions are misleading. For example, the direction is to atari the marked stones, but the problem&#8217;s solution is actually to capture. Two different objectives.</li>
<li>While most of the book is structured very well, sometimes the problems get ahead of themselves. For example, the directions are toÂ atari the stones, but you need to actually be able to read out the ladder to know which way to atari.</li>
<li>For the next edition, I would recommend that jachung (i.e., reducing your own liberties) be introduced earlier since some problems prior to the explanation actually utilize it.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Is this book easy to read?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>It was very easy to progress through the book.</li>
<li>The English is not always the most grammatically correct, but the message is still pretty clear.</li>
</ul>
