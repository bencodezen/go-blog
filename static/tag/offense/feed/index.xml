[expand title=&#8221;Before I Read This Book&#8230;&#8221; trigclass=&#8221;expandTitle&#8221;]
<strong>My Abilities</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>My style of play is a fighting style. The problem that often occurs is that I often find myself overextended or playing moves that seem like they are &#8220;attacking&#8221; but put no pressure on the opponent.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>My Perspective</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>I was really hoping to get a better understanding of attack and defense so that I could really sharpen my blade and increase the potency of my attacks. In addition, I was hoping to get a better understanding of how to defend properly since I hardly hesitate to invade.</li>
</ul>

[expand title=&#8221;My Review&#8221; trigclass=&#8221;expandTitle&#8221; expanded=&#8221;true&#8221;]
<strong>What did I enjoy about the book?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>There is an anecdote about a player who felt that &#8220;territory meant nothing unless it contained a dead group&#8221; that was incredibly eye-opening and changed the way I saw attacking groups.</li>
<li>Does a great job explaining topics (that previously seemed hard to grasp) such as power, forcing moves, inducing moves, etc.</li>
<li>The problems at the end of the book were a great way for me to see if I understood what I had been learning.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What did I gain from reading this book?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A much better understanding of attacking, defense, and the importance and role that power plays in a game.</li>
<li>An improvement in my ability to attack groups properly.</li>
<li>A better understanding of how to find multi-purpose moves that serve both attack and defense purposes.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What style of teaching does the book use?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Lecture Approach
<ul>
<li>The writing is far more substantial in this book than what readers might have become accustomed to in Tesuji and Life and Death.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Primary Learning Mechanism:
<ul>
<li>Explanations with diagrams</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Other Learning Mechanisms:
<ul>
<li>Practice problems</li>
<li>Examples from actual games</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What aspect(s) can be improved on?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>In all honesty, I have a hard time finding anything to criticize about this book; but if I had to request one thing, it would have to be more problems at the end of the book to continue reinforcing what I learned.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Is this book easy to read?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Yes. The writing style in this book makes you feel as if you are having a conversation with Davies and Ishida, which ultimately makes for an enjoyable read.</li>
</ul>
[/expand]
[expand title=&#8221;Recommended For&#8230;&#8221; trigclass=&#8221;expandTitle&#8221;]
<ul>
<li>Players looking for a reference on numerous shapes that are frequently encountered in games.</li>
<li>Players who have read other life and death books and are looking to expand their knowledge and test their skills.</li>
</ul>
