<strong>What&#8217;s the best aspect about this product?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Light-weight and super affordable!</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What is the weakest aspect of this product?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Upon close inspection, the lines are not as clean as you&#8217;ll see on more expensive boards; but it still does the job well!</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Is it durable?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>After handling it, I see no reason why it won&#8217;t hold up to normal usage. However, if somewhere were to try and karate chop this board, I&#8217;m pretty sure it&#8217;d break. xD</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Bottom Line</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>A great go board for someone on a budget!</li>
<li>And in the event you know how to play Chinese chess, there&#8217;s a board of that on the back as well!</li>
<li>Definitely recommended over paper and/or plastic boards that exist out there!</li>
</ol>
[/expand]
[expand title=&#8221;My Review&#8221; trigclass=&#8221;expandTitle&#8221; expanded=&#8221;true&#8221;]
Here&#8217;s the front of the board at a slanted angle. It&#8217;s a nice yellow color to give it a semi-shin-kaya feel. (I prefer the yellow color over brown since it shows more contrast when stones are placed on the board; but that&#8217;s just a personal preference.)</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/01/dirtcheapgoboard02.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-4544" alt="dirtcheapgoboard02" src="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/01/dirtcheapgoboard02.jpg?resize=360%2C270" width="360" height="270" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">And here below, you can see that there&#8217;s a Chinese chess board on the back!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/01/dirtcheapgoboard03.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-4545" alt="dirtcheapgoboard03" src="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/01/dirtcheapgoboard03.jpg?resize=360%2C270" width="360" height="270" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Upon closer inspection, you&#8217;ll see that the lines are not perfectly straight the way you&#8217;ll see on higher quality boards. However, I wouldn&#8217;t let this be a deterrent from purchasing the board if it&#8217;s being used for casual play.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/01/dirtcheapgoboard04.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-4546" alt="dirtcheapgoboard04" src="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/01/dirtcheapgoboard04.jpg?resize=360%2C270" width="360" height="270" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Here are a couple of shots with the board in action with my size 36 glass stones. As you can see, the lines are not so obvious from a player&#8217;s perspective.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/01/dirtcheapgoboard05.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-4547" alt="dirtcheapgoboard05" src="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/01/dirtcheapgoboard05.jpg?resize=360%2C270" width="360" height="270" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/01/dirtcheapgoboard06.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-4548" alt="dirtcheapgoboard06" src="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/01/dirtcheapgoboard06.jpg?resize=360%2C270" width="360" height="270" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/01/dirtcheapgoboard07.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-4549" alt="dirtcheapgoboard07" src="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/01/dirtcheapgoboard07.jpg?resize=360%2C270" width="360" height="270" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Bottom line: I highly recommend this board for people who are looking to purchase boards for their club or for tournaments. This board would also function well as a casual study/playing board. However, I would definitely not recommend this as a primary goban for anyone who is looking for that classic air and sound you get from true wooden boards. So remember, the key thing to remember is that this is a board that focuses on affordability and practicality.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Leather Goban</h2>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> If one ever had the notion that wood boards were too cumbersome to carry around or a pain to store away, <a href="https://twitter.com/AmbyR00">AmbyR00</a> has made a beautiful leather goban that is sure to please any go enthusiast looking for a lightweight go board that is really sturdy! And to top it off, it&#8217;s environmentally friendly because it is made from excess leather from shoe and bag factories, compressed into sheets!<br />

<strong>What&#8217;s the best aspect about this product?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Made out of beautiful leather made use of excess leather that&#8217;s easy to store away!</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What is the weakest aspect of this product?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Because it&#8217;s made out of leather, it doesn&#8217;t have the wood sound when you place each stone, but this is expected and it should be noted that it comes with its own pleasant feeling when each stone contacts the board.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Is it durable?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>As far as I can tell, this will be able to go through a serious beating before becoming unusable.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Bottom Line</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>This is a gorgeous leather go board that looks professionally made!</li>
<li>Totally worth it if you&#8217;re into leather products and would love to own a goban made of one!</li>

[expand title=&#8221;What I Was Hoping For&#8221; trigclass=&#8221;expandTitle&#8221;]
When <a href="https://twitter.com/AmbyR00">AmbyR00</a> first told me about his board, I was hoping that it would be something that would be easily stored away and difficult to store away. In addition, I was hoping that it would be made of quality leather so that it didn&#8217;t feel cheap and easily frayed and damaged.<br />
[/expand]
[expand title=&#8221;My Review&#8221; trigclass=&#8221;expandTitle&#8221; expanded=&#8221;true&#8221;]
A majority of the gobans that I have owned thus far have all been made of wood, so I was thrilled to get a chance to review a goban made of non-traditional material!<br />
<figure id="attachment_4441" style="width: 360px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/01/leathergoban01.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-4441" alt="leathergoban01" src="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/01/leathergoban01.jpg?resize=360%2C270" width="360" height="270" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Here is it in all its glory! (The back is just a straight leather pattern with no markings, so I didn&#8217;t take a picture of it.)</figcaption></figure>
<p style="text-align: left;">Though impacted by a slight tinge of yellow lighting, the board is a beautiful coffee brown color that contrasts really well with the black lines drawn for the goban.</p>
<figure id="attachment_4447" style="width: 360px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/01/leathergoban06.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-4447" alt="leathergoban06" src="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/01/leathergoban06.jpg?resize=360%2C270" width="360" height="270" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Here&#8217;s a close-up of AmbyR00&#8217;s signature! So cool!</figcaption></figure>
<p style="text-align: left;">As it stands, I think that this makes a great table goban since it&#8217;s super light-weight and is really a pleasure to use. Here are some pictures of the board in action!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/01/leathergoban02.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-4443" alt="leathergoban02" src="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/01/leathergoban02.jpg?resize=360%2C270" width="360" height="270" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>

<p style="text-align: left;">At the end of the day, if you&#8217;re looking for a light-weight goban that looks gorgeous and is easy to store away, this leather goban definitely fits the bill! Let me know if you ever have any additional questions!</p>
[/expand]
[expand title=&#8221;How Was It Made?&#8221; trigclass=&#8221;expandTitle&#8221; expanded=&#8221;true&#8221;]
<em>The original post can be found here: &#8220;<a title="AmbyR00's Blog Post on Creating His Leather Goban" href="http://worldismygoban.blogspot.fi/2010/12/leather-is-sexy-especially-with-polka.html">Leather is sexy, especially with polka dots</a>&#8220;, but I&#8217;ve recreated the content here because my biggest fear is that the link might break one day if Blogger ever goes down.</em><br />
&#8220;As I&#8217;m working as an intern in a little workshop that prints and binds calendars and presses many different things from many different materials I got an opportunity to use a silk press to print some leather gobans for the go club I plan to set up. Now all I need is some stones.<br />
I used Inkscape to create <a href="http://ubuntuone.com/p/SUZ/">the print</a> (hint: use Inkscape to view it!) on the leather board, you can download the design and freely use it with your own goban. I printed the board on six transparencies, that I taped together and used as a film to develop a template for the silk press. I was originally going for six goban, but ended up with ten of them.<br />
<figure id="attachment_4616" style="width: 400px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/01/leathergobanpost01.jpeg"><img class="size-full wp-image-4616" alt="leathergobanpost01" src="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/01/leathergobanpost01.jpeg?resize=400%2C300" width="400" height="300" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">The leather before it was cut. This wasn&#8217;t the only one.</figcaption></figure>
<figure id="attachment_4617" style="width: 480px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/01/leathergobanpost02.jpeg"><img class="size-full wp-image-4617" alt="leathergobanpost02" src="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/01/leathergobanpost02.jpeg?resize=480%2C640" width="480" height="640" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">This was the template used to create the prints on the boards.</figcaption></figure>
The finished boards look actually very nice. Leather is pretty good material for creating something like a portable goban. I&#8217;ll need to take a picture of one in daylight so it captures the whole beauty of them. Here&#8217;s one I took with my phone when they were out from print and drying up:<br />
<figure id="attachment_4618" style="width: 472px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/01/leathergobanpost03.jpeg"><img class=" wp-image-4618" alt="leathergobanpost03" src="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/01/leathergobanpost03.jpeg?resize=472%2C354" width="472" height="354" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">The finished boards. The polka dots really cheer them up.</figcaption></figure>
Actually, these are not the first boards I have made, I also did some smaller practice boards few months ago from plywood, <a href="http://www.dammfine.com/projects/gobans/">laser printed paper gobans</a>, glue and water.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/01/leathergobanpost04.jpeg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-4619" alt="leathergobanpost04" src="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/01/leathergobanpost04.jpeg?resize=464%2C348" width="464" height="348" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">See you later! ^^ /gg&#8221;</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Folding Go Board</h2>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> When it comes to go on the go (yes that just happened), this folding go board from GoGameGuru really does seem to hit the sweet spot between portability, quality, and price. It utilizes a hinge mechanism to keep the go board in one piece and even has a Chinese chess board on the reverse side! Recommended stone size are 21 or 22. It fits other stones, but it&#8217;s a bit snug. Highly recommended!<br />

<p><strong>What is one aspect this product could improve on?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>This is expected and in the product description, but I can&#8217;t help but wish that the board could accommodate all sizes of stones. Granted, that would make the board larger; but it&#8217;s just a small thing that would be nice. =D</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Is it durable?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>So far so good! The laminate does seem like it could dent if you dropped something heavy on it, but it seems to hold up just fine with regular use (aka placing stones on the board). The wood also seems quite solid, but I would refrain from dropping it.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Bottom Line</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>An incredible portable board that looks great when you&#8217;re using it.</li>
<li>Fits like a dream in my backpack and delivers on portability.</li>
<li>The best portable board I&#8217;ve seen on the market so far. Highly recommended!</li>

[expand title=&#8221;What I Was Hoping For&#8221; trigclass=&#8221;expandTitle&#8221;]
For those who have been following me since the beginning, I&#8217;m sure you remembered that I bought <a title="Equipment Review: Folding Wooden Go Board" href="//equipment-review-folding-wooden-go-board/">one</a> quite some time ago. During my hiatus of go, it transferred ownership to my good friend Nate. So naturally, with me being back in go full force, it was inevitable that I would need to find a replacement. And though I have seen one or two online, the shipping has always been rather ridiculous or the board wasn&#8217;t quite what I was looking for. So when I found out about this product, I couldn&#8217;t order it fast enough!<br />

<p style="text-align: left;">As you can see in the pictures above, the board comes in a well designed box that looked quite professional. If they could translate the text into English, I could totally see this product being primed for being sold in Western stores (since some people just get weirded out by languages they don&#8217;t understand). Some of the go products I&#8217;ve seen sold in book stores and such seem a bit shoddy and could really use a make-over.</p>

This was a pleasant surprise for me when I unfolded it. I used to play Chinese chess when I was a kid and so I was pretty psyched when I found out that this portable board could also double as a Chinese chess board. Score! But for the those who have no interest in this side, you can take comfort in that the hinges are exposed on this side so that it does not interfere with the go side of the board.<br />

<figure id="attachment_4340" style="width: 320px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2013/11/foldinggoban12.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-4340" alt="foldinggoban12" src="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2013/11/foldinggoban12.jpg?resize=320%2C240" width="320" height="240" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Folding go board in action with size 36 glass stones (close-up #2)</figcaption></figure>
As you can see from the photos of the board in action, the size 36 stones fit rather snugly on the board and can feel a bit cluttered. So though it does fit, it would make for a more enjoyable experience to use size 21/22 stones as recommended. As a result, it&#8217;s no surprise that I will would recommend the <a title="Equipment Review: The Go Bento Box" href="//equipment-review-go-bento-box/">Go Bento Box</a> as this board&#8217;s traveling companion.<br />
At the end of the day, this board really does a remarkable job of providing portability, great value, and a very pleasing aesthetic look for an incredible price. Definitely well worth every penny. So if you&#8217;re in the market for a folding go board, be sure to add this one to your cart!</p>
