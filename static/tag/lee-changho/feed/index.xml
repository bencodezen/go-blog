[expand title=&#8221;Before I Read This Book&#8230;&#8221; trigclass=&#8221;expandTitle&#8221;]
When I first started learning about modern day go professionals, it&#8217;s to no one&#8217;s surprise that one of the first names I came upon was Lee Changho. Not only was he extremely famous, but it seemed he was undisputedly #1 at the time (although he might have started dropping ranks by the time I learned about him). So it goes without saying that I was curious what made him so strong, and thus it led me to purchasing this book.<br />
[/expand]
[expand title=&#8221;My Review&#8221; trigclass=&#8221;expandTitle&#8221; expanded=&#8221;true&#8221;]
Similar to Master Style of Play: Go Seigen, you are initially greeted with a fun little dialogue between Yuan Zhou and two amateur players to give an introduction on Lee Changho and his background. After a couple of pages of this, Zhou then dives right into the game reviews.<br />
One of the things that I enjoyed about the game diagrams in this book is that they are often only a couple moves long. This makes it a lot easier to follow what is going on and allows weaker players to have a chance to understand what is going on. In addition, the variations are kept to a minimum in order to keep a focus on Lee Changho&#8217;s style instead of go theory and technique.<br />
Upon finishing both game commentaries, I am glad that I finally took the time to gain insight into Lee Changho&#8217;s style. It&#8217;s quite simple and straightforward when compared to Go Seigen, but it is one of the more appropriate styles that I feel kyu players should check out first. This is because Lee Changho&#8217;s games convey the prime example of how one does not have to risk battles of epic proportions to win games, which is something I think many kyu players never take the time to learn or realize.<br />
At the end of the day, this is a book that is best suited for those looking to get a glimpse into Lee Changho&#8217;s style and what it means to play calm go. Definitely recommended for kyu players.<br />

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After I got back from boxing last night, I was pretty much wiped out. The funny thing about me is that no matter how tired I am though, it seems that I somehow manage to find the energy and motivation to do something go related. So I decided to check out my first episode of a BadukTV English game review of Lee Changho 9P vs. Lee Sedol 9P.<br />
For those who aren&#8217;t aware of the popularity of go in the rest of the world, there are actual television channels that are ENTIRELY dedicated to go. Now, I don&#8217;t know about you, but I would love it if we had something equivalent here in the Western world. Unfortunately though, go has not yet risen to that level of popularity. On the upside though, pioneers like GoGamGuru and BadukTV have taken the first big step to bringing us one step closer to that dream.<br />
Here is the video that I watched last night:<br />
<iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='720' height='405' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/videoseries?list=PLq69jNwwOmf-Lkbyny1HwiRUKMg6uuFo2&#038;hl=en_US' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe>
Since I had never watched a TV episode dedicated entirely to go (excluding <em>Hikaru no Go</em>), I was a little nervous that I might get bored or that I would be unable to gain anything from it. Contrary to my fears however, I was pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoyed it. Though many complain about the co-host interrupting often and saying &#8220;Yes&#8221; all the time, you have to be conscious of the fact that the English is clearly not her first language and that chances are pretty good that her mannerisms derive from Korean culture. So with that in mind, I was able to look past it rather easily and just enjoy all the marvelous go.<br />

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Yesterday, I had the pleasure of attending another one of <a title="Yuan Zhou's Website" href="http://www.zhouyuan.com/">Yuan Zhou</a>&#8216;s Monthly Workshops!<br />
We started off with a life and death problem that is called &#8220;hunting the 6 stone bird.&#8221; Apparently it&#8217;s a very old problem that has been around for a long time, for those wondering what the shape looks like. For those who would like to try it out for themselves, here it is below:<br />
<figure id="attachment_1663" style="width: 250px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2013/01/6stonebird.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-1663" alt="6stonebird" src="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2013/01/6stonebird.png?resize=250%2C250" width="250" height="250" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Black to play.</figcaption></figure>
Afterwards, I got to hear a very captivating  review for one of <a title="Lee Chang Ho's Page" href="http://senseis.xmp.net/?YiChangHo">Lee Changho</a> 9p Vs. <a title="Park Jung Hwan's Page" href="http://senseis.xmp.net/?ParkJungHwan">Park Junghwan</a> 9p games in the most recent Ing Cup World Go Championship. It was one that was full of full of suspense, excitement, and a capturing battle on epic proportions that made Park Junghwan the decisive victor.<br />
As I listened to Yuan Zhou review the game, there were a few things that really struck me:<br />
<span id="more-1650"></span></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Professionals pay particular attention to their weak groups</strong>. They almost never let a weak group go unattended for more than a move or two.</li>
<li><strong>Professionals never play follow the leader.</strong> They try to figure out what their opponent is trying to do, and then usually come up with a move to interrupt the flow of their opponent&#8217;s game.</li>
<li><strong>Professional games tend to steer away from killing groups.</strong> The reasons lies in the fact that it is very difficult to kill a group and you usually end up sacrificing a lot of points in the process of attempting to do so.</li>
</ol>
<p>In addition, one of the biggest takeaways I had from the entire workshop is <strong>how incredibly important life and death is</strong>. I mean, sure, we all know that life and death is &#8220;important,&#8221; but I think that most players brush it off as a tedious chore that gets in the way of their game. And while I will be sure to write an article further detailing my new found appreciation for life and death, I leave you with this thought: Imagine the possibilities if you could live wherever you invaded/reduced. Wouldn&#8217;t every game become far more simpler?<br />
After the review, we had lunch and played a game with one another. As I looked back on my game, I believe that the reverse komi (-7.5 points) caused my opponent to take more risks than he needed to. In addition, our ranks are most likely about equal, so I believe that the game was rather lopsided to begin with. With that in mind, I do think that my play overall was rather poor and still shows a lack of my attention to the fundamentals of strong players.<br />
