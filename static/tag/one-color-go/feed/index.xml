				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So sorry for the failure to post Friday or Saturday. Lots going on, but the following kifu is of my game against an 8k. I think it was pretty exciting and an excellent game for my persistence and some of my more clever moves that I&#8217;ve played in my games so far. Unfortunately, I ended up losing by 1.5 points. I&#8217;m pretty sure I messed up some yose maneuvers which may have actually cost me the game. I also managed to make it to GWGC after running some errands and had part of my game reviewed and learned some really interesting things. I&#8217;ll put the comments in on the parts that were reviewed.<br />

To top everything off however, I also got to play my FIRST game of&#8230;. wait for it&#8230;. ONE COLOR GO. And actually, it was also my first game against Mr. Justin Teng. Now mind you, I wasn&#8217;t trying to win&#8230; I was just trying to make it as far as I could into the game. Here&#8217;s a picture of the game.<br />

Not shabby for my first game. Now I&#8217;m almost certainly being decimated, but I was happy with being able to get this far.</p>
