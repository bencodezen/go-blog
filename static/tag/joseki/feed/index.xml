				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As I’ve been starting to unravel the tightly wound knot that has been at the core of my fear to play games the way I used to, one of the things I noticed is that there is one joseki in particular that has played a major role in my discomfort at playing full games.<br />
<a href="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/12/one-space-low-pincer.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5942" src="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/12/one-space-low-pincer.png?resize=241%2C121" alt="one-space-low-pincer" width="241" height="121" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><br />
Yup. The one-space low pincer to the high-one space approach to the 3-4. Words cannot express how much I hated seeing that move played against me due to one simple fact: I have no idea how to properly play against it.<br />
Now of course, everyone will say there are plenty of resources online for me to look it up and study it. The issue however, is that I don’t find online resources terribly helpful in learning joseki and I haven’t quite figured out the best way that I learn joseki. Generally speaking, there are two primary approaches to it: (1) get a broad overview and keep playing, making mistakes and learning as you go, and (2) “memorize” all the different variations so you know how to get an even position (locally) about of the different variations.<br />
While I’m more of a fan of approach #1, I have to say that I’m still in pursuit of the hybrid of the two approaches. Of course, for anyone who has read up on getting stronger, the general advice is “learn joseki and then forget it immediately.” And though the wisdom in that statement is evident to me, I find that I am more comfortable and confident if I start with some sort of foundation before running off and exploring on my own.<br />
Since I’m not a huge fan of the online resources for learning joseki (at least the ones I’m aware of), I was fortunate enough to obtain a copy of the <em>21st Century Dictionary of Basic Joseki, Vol. 1 &amp; 2</em> recently (courtesy of Mr. Richard Bozulich) and plan to use it to finally resolve my fear of the one-space low pincer.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Get Strong at Joseki 3</h2>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> In the fourth volume of the Get Strong at Go Series, Bozulich and Kazunari familiarizes the reader with 10 josekis that commonly occur around the star point, how to handle them in regards to their variations, choosing the correct joseki given the whole board, and how to play after the joseki is completed. A great book for players who want a better grasp on joseki as a whole.<br />

[expand title=&#8221;Before I Read This Book&#8230;&#8221; trigclass=&#8221;expandTitle&#8221;]
As I mentioned before in the previous two volumes (<a title="Book Review: Get Strong at Joseki 1" href="//book-review-get-strong-at-joseki-1/">GTAJ1</a> &amp; <a title="Book Review: Get Strong at Joseki 2" href="//book-review-get-strong-joseki-2/">GTAJ2</a>), joseki is not a real strength of mine. While I have become aware of some common ones due to experience using them or making mistakes, learning joseki has always been a bit of a challenge for me. With this final volume though, I was really looking forward to seeing star point joseki be featured.<br />
[/expand]
[expand title=&#8221;Synopsis&#8221; trigclass=&#8221;expandTitle&#8221;]
<strong>What did I enjoy about the book?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>I really liked the fact that Bozulich &amp; Kazunari included joseki that are not commonly found in resources like Josekipedia. An example of this include the high one space double approach.</li>
<li>I enjoy the fact that Bozulich &amp; Kazunari includes some common trick plays and how to handle them.</li>
<li>The problems contain variations on different scenarios that really help acclimate the reader to seeing how just one slight chance in the sequence can completely change the outcome.</li>
<li>There is a whole section devoted to choosing joseki in regards to the entire board.</li>
<li>Proper attention is given to how to play once a joseki is finished.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What did I gain from reading this book?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A realization that there is a lot more to start point joseki than I was aware.</li>
<li>A better understanding of some of the reasons behind why certain joseki are played.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What is the format of the book?</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Similar to the <a title="Book Review: Get Strong at Joseki 1" href="//book-review-get-strong-at-joseki-1/">GTSAJ1</a> and <a title="Book Review: Get Strong at Joseki 2" href="//book-review-get-strong-joseki-2/">GTSAJ2</a>, there is an introduction section that familiarizes the reader with the featured joseki in the book. Afterwards, the rest are practice problems accompanied by their solutions to help the reader gain a better grasp on the joseki.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>What aspects can be improved on?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>No complaints here!</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Is this book easy to read?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Yes and no. The explanations are short and concise for those who are familiar with much of go strategy and its terminology. For those who might be unfamiliar with things such as a &#8220;severe pincer&#8221; or how moves are &#8220;pressuring another group&#8221; might find it a little hard to comprehend.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Bottom Line</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Excellent format for players to familiarize themselves with some common star point joseki along with some not so common ones as well.</li>
<li>Gives great practice for trying to see the board as a whole instead of localized sequences.</li>
<li>A fantastic way for players to gain a better handle on using joseki instead of simply memorizing them.</li>
</ol>
[/expand]
[expand title=&#8221;My Review&#8221; trigclass=&#8221;expandTitle&#8221; expanded=&#8221;true&#8221;]
As with the previous volumes, I was very pleased overall with the quality of problems in this book. Bozulich &amp; Kazunari continued to live up to my expectations and did a great job with the star point joseki featured in this book. Just like before though, I found that the first section regarding joseki variations was still quite difficult for me to work through. To be clear though, Bozulich acknowledges that this will be common for many players at first due to unfamiliarity with the material. So it&#8217;s nothing to fret about.<br />
The favorite part of my book is still the section on &#8220;Choosing the Right Joseki and Playing the Right Joseki&#8221; since it is geared toward getting to the reader to take into account the whole board when making their decision. This is a wonderful change of scenery from the narrow perspective that players often practice on (such as focusing on just a corner or two groups for life and death). Definitely the best section of the entire series.<br />

<li>I have had some exposure to joseki, but for the most part I have avoided the study of joseki for a long time. As a result, I would consider my knowledge and ability to use joseki to be very weak, ESPECIALLY when it comes to the 5-4 and 5-3 points.</li>

<li>After reading <a title="Book Review: Get Strong at Joseki 1" href="//book-review-get-strong-at-joseki-1/">Get Strong at Joseki 1</a>, I was looking forward to what this book had to offer.

<strong>My Abilities</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>I have been exposed to a fair number of joseki by this point, but I was far from being able to understand why they were played the way they were. In addition, figuring out how to punish josekis was a whole level above my head as well.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>My Perspective</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>While I might have become familiar with a few joseki here and there, I was realy hoping to start from the ground up and get a much better how joseki are created and built.</li>
</ul>
[/expand]
[expand title=&#8221;Synopsis&#8221;  trigclass=&#8221;expandTitle&#8221;]
<strong>What did I enjoy about the book?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The way they teach joseki is SO easy to understand!</li>
<li>They take their time explaining why certain moves are mistakes.</li>
<li>There are many opportunities for reinforcement on picking the right move.</li>
<li>They have you evaluate the first 30-40 moves of a game and have you figure out which move was a mistake.</li>
<li>They teach joseki that takes into consider other stone positions such as a star side point that is occupied.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What did I gain from reading this book?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A much better understanding of why joseki sequences are what they are.</li>
<li>A significant boost in my comfort with joseki as a whole.</li>
<li>Higher confidence in my ability to &#8220;create joseki&#8221; rather than &#8220;memorize joseki.&#8221;</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What is the format of the book?</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>A brief introduction on why one should study joseki along with some advice for how to study joseki.</li>
<li>A brief review on the proper way to extend.</li>
<li>All chapters on joseki then following the format below:
<ol>
<li>Basic overview of the sequence for the joseki with accompanying one line explanations for each move.</li>
<li>A page or two on how to deal with mistakes and why the mistakes are good or bad for the respective player.</li>
<li>Practice problems for how to respond to different situations. This includes mistakes along with proper moves.</li>
<li>One to two problems where you have to evaluation a kifu (approximately 10-30 moves long) and determine which player played better and which move was the mistake.</li>
<li>One to two sample professional openings that usually contain the joseki that the reader just learned.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>What aspect can be improved on?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>There are some useful proverbs that are placed on the bottom of the page (e.g., &#8220;Even a moron connects against a peep.&#8221;), but they can be rather cryptic at times. This is possibly due to the fact they were translated from Korean, but they&#8217;re not as helpful as I was hoping. Although to be clear, this is not the focus of the book, so it&#8217;s not a big deal.</li>
<li>They need to make more of these books! More more more!</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Is this book easy to read?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Yes. It doesn&#8217;t get much simpler than this.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Bottom Line</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>This is how joseki should have been taught from day one!</li>
<li>An incredible way to be introduced to joseki as a whole.</li>
<li>Serves as a fantastic companion to the rest of the Level Up Series.</li>
</ol>

[expand title=&#8221;My Review&#8221; trigclass=&#8221;expandTitle&#8221; expanded=&#8221;true&#8221;]
One of the reasons I have always avoided the study of joseki is that most of the literature out there is EXTREMELY dense when you consider that a large portion of players interested in joseki are kyu players. In addition, I personally feel that kyu players encounter far more star point joseki in their games due to the nature of being a kyu player. In addition, star point joseki have far fewer variations and much easier to undrestand.<br />
This is seriously an incredible milestone for go literature. In all honesty, this is the book that everyone should use when they want to start learning about joseki. And in fact, this is the way that all joseki should be taught from the get go. There are so many opportunities for reinforcement. For example, I am completely in love with the new problem format they introduce: analyzing a kifu and determining not only who played better, but which move was the mistake as well! INCREDIBLE!<br />
[/expand]
[expand title=&#8221;Recommended For&#8230;&#8221; trigclass=&#8221;expandTitle&#8221;]
<ul>
<li>Players who want an easy to understand introduction to creating joseki (as opposed to memorizing them).</li>
<li>Players who want opportunities to practice the sequence through problems instead of waiting till the off-chance it occurs in their games.</li>
</ul>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Get Strong at Joseki 1</h2>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> In the second volume of the Get Strong at Go Series, Bozulich familiarizes the reader with 11 basic josekis that commonly occur around the 3-4 point and how to handle them in regards to their variations, choosing the correct joseki given the whole board, and how to play after the joseki is completed. A great book for players who want a better grasp on joseki as a whole.<br />

<strong>My Abilities</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>I have had some exposure to joseki, but for the most part I have avoided the study of joseki for a long time. As a result, I would consider my knowledge and ability to use joseki to be very weak.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>My Perspective</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>As I am a big fan of the Get Strong at Go Series, I&#8217;m really hoping that this will help me gain more familiarity with joseki and increase my comfort with using them.</li>
</ul>
[/expand]
[expand title=&#8221;Synopsis&#8221; trigclass=&#8221;expandTitle&#8221;]
<strong>What did I enjoy about the book?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>I enjoy the fact that Bozulich includes some common trick plays and how to handle them.</li>
<li>The problems contain variations on different scenarios that really help acclimate the reader to seeing how just one slight chance in the sequence can completely change the outcome.</li>
<li>There is a whole section devoted to choosing joseki in regards to the entire board.</li>
<li>Proper attention is given to how to play once a joseki is finished.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What did I gain from reading this book?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>An increased liking and familiarity with joseki.</li>
<li>A better understanding of how to apply joseki to my own games.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What is the format of the book?</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Introduction to the 11 basic joseki focused on in this book.</li>
<li>A section of practice problems focusing on joseki variations.</li>
<li>A section of practice problems focusing on choosing the correct joseki given the whole board context.</li>
<li>A section of practice problems on how to continue play once the joseki is complete.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>What aspects can be improved on?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>No complaints here!</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Is this book easy to read?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Yes and no. The explanations are short and concise for those who are familiar with much of go strategy and its terminology. For those who might be unfamiliar with things such as a &#8220;severe pincer&#8221; or how moves are &#8220;pressuring another group&#8221; might find it a little hard to comprehend.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Bottom Line</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Excellent format for players to familiarize themselves with joseki.</li>
<li>Gives great practice for trying to see the board as a whole instead of localized sequences.</li>
<li>A fantastic way for players to gain a better handle on using joseki instead of simply memorizing them.</li>
</ol>

[expand title=&#8221;My Review&#8221; trigclass=&#8221;expandTitle&#8221; expanded=&#8221;true&#8221;]
Overall, I was very impressed with this book. While the first section of the book regarding joseki variations was a bit difficult for me to work through (since my own knowledge of joseki is very weak), the other two sections were very helpful and enjoyable to practice since I was able to be exposed to a lot of new ideas and practice my whole board evaluation ability. As mentioned above in the &#8220;Before I Read This Book&#8221; section, I am someone who has always been adverse to joseki and have thus avoided the topic as a whole. So the fact that I did not find this book excruciating to work through speaks quite a bit about it.<br />

<strong>My Abilities</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Although I&#8217;ve had some exposure to joseki, I have avoided studying them like the plague. I really, really don&#8217;t like studying joseki.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>My Perspective</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>After reading the first volume, I was excited to get started on this volume to continue seeing how good my whole board thinking was.</li>

[expand title=&#8221;My Review&#8221; trigclass=&#8221;expandTitle&#8221; expanded=&#8221;true&#8221;]
<strong>What did I enjoy about the book?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Really simple and easy to understand explanations for positions that were once foreign to me.</li>
<li>Does a great job keeping the opening to a realistic scenario that you might actually see in your own game.</li>
<li>Shows the reader that there can be more than one right answer in a position.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What did I gain from reading this book?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Improved understanding of how certain moves work with the board as a whole.</li>
<li>Reduction in kyu tunnel vision since I have more practice considering the whole board position.</li>
<li>Slightly better understanding of joseki patterns for the 3-4 point, high and far kakari. Though in all honesty, I&#8217;ve already forgotten most of it already. Haha.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What style of teaching does the book use?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Off the Cliff Style
<ul>
<li>There is no gradual progression into the material.</li>
<li>You learn through trial and error as you progress through the book.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Primary Learning Mechanism:
<ul>
<li>Multiple choice practice problems.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Other Learning Mechanisms:
<ul>
<li>Clear and concise explanations with an accompanying diagram to illustrate his point.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What aspect can be improved on?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>They need to come out with another volume on star point joseki! That would be awesome!</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Is this book easy to read?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Absolutely. The explanations are no longer than a paragraph long and are very clear and concise.</li>

[expand title=&#8221;Synopsis&#8221; trigclass=&#8221;expandTitle&#8221; ]
<strong>What did I enjoy about the book?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>There are joseki covered in here that are not typically covered by sites like Eidogo or Josekipedia.</li>
<li>Explanations are pretty short and concise.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What did I gain from reading this book?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>As a beginner, I had a hard time grasping anything from the book.</li>
<li>As a more advanced player, I had more appreciation for the unique josekis they showed. However, I am still not confident in saying that I know all 38 basic joseki very well.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What style of teaching does the book use?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Textbook Approach
<ul>
<li>Content is organized in a curriculum format and follows a lecture style of writing.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Primary Learning Mechanism:
<ul>
<li>Explanations with example diagrams</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What aspect can be improved on?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Though I&#8217;m not a fan of this book as a whole for beginners, there are no complaints regarding the overall content quality and presentation.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Is this book easy to read?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>As a beginner, this was not an easy book to read. The material was rather dense and was difficult to understand. For players that are more advanced however, the book is written rather concisely and one will appreciate how much content is packed into such a small book.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Bottom Line</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Best viewed as a review of joseki rather than a study of it.</li>
<li>Contains unique josekis such as how to handle a 3-3 invasion if you already have a one point jump.</li>
<li>Not very helpful for beginners looking to understand more about the game.</li>
<li>Definitely more appropriate for advanced players who already have a very firm grasp of the game.</li>
</ol>

<strong>My Abilities</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>I was utterly brand new to the game when I purchased this book.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>My Perspective</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>I was hopeful that I would be able to memorize all the basic joseki that people normally encounter in their games and apply it to my own. Little did I know that my perspective was very naiive and very impractical.</li>
</ul>

[expand title=&#8221;My Review&#8221; trigclass=&#8221;expandTitle&#8221; expanded=&#8221;true&#8221;]
The length of the book is a double-edged sword for most readers. On one hand, the explanations of each joseki are short enough that you are done reading it before you get bored. On the other hand, the brevity of the explanations means that the explanations are more abstract and at a higher level. While this may be good for stronger players look­ing to reinforce their under­standing of joseki, most of the explanations will be but empty words to the average player.<br />
This book delivers in regards to covering a good num­ber of pop­u­lar josekis and their variations. On the other hand, I found that learning anything practical from this book was rather difficult. It hits so many points in the explana­tions that anyone with a weak foundation in concepts such as whole board thinking will be unable to put anything to practical use.<br />
Fortunately, there is a redeem­ing qual­ity to this book: the sec­tions on the vary­ing josekis on the 4–4 point. It does an excellent job explaining positions that Eidogo does not have. For example, how to handle a 3–3 inva­sion when you already have a small knight’s move.<br />
At the end of the day, this book is best viewed as an exposure/review book for joseki. You might pick up a thing or two here and there, but for most players it will be rather difficult to apply it to your own games since the position always changes. If you are looking to study joseki like you would for a class, then a good place to start would be the <em>Dictionary of Basic Joseki</em> by Ishida Yoshio. Also, for those who already have a basic sense of joseki and want more guidance on why certain choices are better than others in different board positions, be sure to check out Whole Board Thinking (<a title="Book Review: Whole Board Thinking in Joseki, Vol 1" href="//book-review-whole-board-thinking-in-joseki-vol-1/">Vol. 1</a> &amp; <a title="Book Review: Whole Board Thinking in Joseki, Vol 2" href="//book-review-whole-board-thinking-in-joseki-vol-2/">Vol. 2</a>) by Yilun Yang.<br />
