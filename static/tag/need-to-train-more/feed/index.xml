				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So yesterday wasn&#8217;t as eventful as I&#8217;d like, I got to play Keith in a full on handicap game and that was fun&#8230;. but then I had to leave early so no more Go that night&#8230; I also forgot to bring my Kifu book from YMImports so bummer that.<br />
Today was interesting though.  I got to play one timed game (regular and speed) with Todd.  Definitely have a long way to go&#8230; And then I got to play two more games that were quite challenging.  I made some careless errors and reads that cost me the game, but I think I&#8217;ve learned a lot from it.  I&#8217;m still too unfamiliar with what to do and how to read things&#8230; so more studying to do.</p>
