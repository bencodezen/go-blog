[expand title=&#8221;Before I Read This Book&#8230;&#8221; trigclass=&#8221;expandTitle&#8221;]
<strong>My Abilities</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>When it came to moyo (i.e. frameworks), I had one of two weapons in my arsenal: (1) Build the biggest framework possible and hopefully kill anything that comes inside. (2) Always invade my opponent&#8217;s framework and try to live. In the rare occasion that I thought to reduce the framework, the timing was usually off.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>My Perspective</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>By reading this book, I was hoping to gain a more balanced perspective on how to deal with and build moyos. Though I did not have a chance to preview the book, I was also hoping the teaching format would be a combination of explanations along with practice problems.</li>
</ul>
[/expand]
[expand title=&#8221;My Review&#8221; trigclass=&#8221;expandTitle&#8221; expanded=&#8221;true&#8221;]
<strong>What did I enjoy about the book?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>I really liked how they broke down attacking and defending moyos into 13 basic principles. Although it may be some time before they stick in my brain, I felt that the one line &#8220;proverbs&#8221; were very helpful.</li>
<li>The practice problems they provided were a great test of the principles that they introduced in the beginning of the book.</li>
<li>The explanations were very clear and usually provided an incorrect variation with an explanation of why it contradicted the 13 basic principles.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What did I gain from reading this book?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A better understanding of how to attack and defend moyos.</li>
<li>Greater confidence in dealing with my opponent&#8217;s moyos.</li>
<li>Inadvertently ended up getting a better understanding of whole board thinking since I have an improved ability to see moyos forming before it is way too late.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What style of teaching does the book use?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Multi-Pronged Approach
<ul>
<li>There are equal parts explanations, practice problems, along with game commentaries.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Learning Mechanisms
<ul>
<li>Explanations with example diagrams</li>
<li>Professional games with commentary</li>
<li>Practice problems</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What aspect can be improved on?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>I am happy to say that this book is great as it stands!</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Is this book easy to read?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Yes. The explanations are explained using laymen terms and are pretty short and straightforward.</li>
</ul>
