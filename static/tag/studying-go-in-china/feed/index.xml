				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So today was productive. Two solid games under my belt. Finished <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Nihon Ki-in&#8217;s Handbook of Proverbs</span> and working my way towards the finish line for <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Fundamental Principles of Go</span>. Worked solidly on <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Get Strong at Life and Death</span>.<br />
Outside of trying to create the regimen, I&#8217;m seriously looking into programs in China/Taiwan that would allow Westerners to study Go hardcore for 3 months. Been reading blogs about the program for <a href="http://internetgoschool.com/goinchina.vhtml" target="_blank">Guo Juan Intensive Go Study in China</a>. Very interesting stuff. Will be sure to post more on my thoughts about that when I read more.</p>
<ol>
<li>Problems &#8211; 30 solid minutes.</li>
<li>Theory &#8211; Exemplary.</li>
<li>1 Solid Game &#8211; Completed.</li>
</ol>
<p>Also, it&#8217;s going to sound and look like I&#8217;ve read a ton of Go books. In theory, that means I should be growing exponentially! One little detail though, I&#8217;ve READ them. Comprehension is an ENTIRELY different matter. Once I work through all the ones I want to work through, re-reading and re-reviewing will be occurring. But that seems very far away.</p>
