<p>My <a href="http://shop.gogameguru.com/">GoGameGuru</a> order came in!!! Woot woot!!! You can see everything I got in the picture (except the glass stones which are inside the bowls). There is so much to write about and review. Haha. However, since I do need a little bit of time to put the reviews together, the one thing I want to recommend right away is the <a href="http://shop.gogameguru.com/folding-go-board/?acc=e4da3b7fbbce2345d7772b0674a318d5">Foldable Go Board</a>. The quality is incredible for the price and it&#8217;s definitely my favorite item of my entire order. So if you&#8217;re in the market for a foldable go board, don&#8217;t wait!<br />
On a more journalistic note, I&#8217;ve been on a losing streak lately. Interestingly enough however, I&#8217;m actually okay with it. The training to try and maintain zen in high pressure situations or even after losing has been tough; but I think it&#8217;s been doing me some good. In fact, I was even able to resign a game that I was winning (against a 5 kyu) since I had more pressing matters to attend to. And if you&#8217;re wondering why I think it&#8217;s an accomplishment, it&#8217;s because I never would have been able to do that in the past. I would have saw the game as rightfully mine to win and probably have been unable to walk away from it.<br />
As one might expect, my rank has been dropping left and right; but surprisingly enough, I&#8217;m actually okay with it. I&#8217;m not worried about whether or not the server thinks I&#8217;m stronger or not. I am taking on my weaknesses head on. It might make me lose a stone or two for now, but I think the benefit I will gain from this approach will be worth it. =)</p>
