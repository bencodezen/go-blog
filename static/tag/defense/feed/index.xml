<h2 style="text-align: center;">Master Play: The Fighting Styles of Kato Masao &amp; Seo Bong Soo</h2>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> In this X volume of the Master Play series, Yuan Zhou does a magnificent job taking amateur players through what is actually considered &#8220;fighting style&#8221; in the professional world of go. Due to the chaotic nature that go can take in crazy cross-cuts and blown out battles, it is no surprise that many kyu players might consider themselves &#8220;fighters,&#8221; but once you read this book, it might open to your eyes as to what fighting really means.<br />

[expand title=&#8221;Before I Read This Book&#8230;&#8221; trigclass=&#8221;expandTitle&#8221;]
Like many kyu players out there, I always considered myself to have a &#8220;fighting style.&#8221; After all, my games consisted primarily of big battles and trying to kill things. If that&#8217;s not fighting, what is right? Well I wanted to find out for myself whether I could see my go in famous professional players actually known for their fighting. So as I&#8217;m in a bit of a haze in my journey at the moment, it wasn&#8217;t long before I found myself purchasing this book to try and shed some light on my own style.<br />
[/expand]
[expand title=&#8221;My Review&#8221; trigclass=&#8221;expandTitle&#8221; expanded=&#8221;true&#8221;]
Similar to the previous volumes I read (Master Play: The Style of Lee Changho and The Style of Go Seigen), Yuan Zhou began each section with a brief introduction to the player&#8217;s background. Being as I am still quite unfamiliar with the professional go scene, it was very entertaining while very informative. Without the introductions, I imagine that the game review would not have been nearly as enjoyable.<br />
In this volume, Zhou reviews two monumental games from each players&#8217; career. With each one, the diagrams are usually quite short and the accompanying explanations really helped me to follow the games without much issue. It definitely feels like the explanations were written with kyu amateur players in mind.<br />
It was just utterly astounding seeing how these infamous &#8220;fighters&#8221; actually played.<br />
Yet again, Yuan Zhou does not fail to amaze me with how he is able to explain what is going on in the board.<br />

[expand title=&#8221;Before I Read This Book&#8230;&#8221; trigclass=&#8221;expandTitle&#8221;]
<strong>My Abilities</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>My style of play is a fighting style. The problem that often occurs is that I often find myself overextended or playing moves that seem like they are &#8220;attacking&#8221; but put no pressure on the opponent.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>My Perspective</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>I was really hoping to get a better understanding of attack and defense so that I could really sharpen my blade and increase the potency of my attacks. In addition, I was hoping to get a better understanding of how to defend properly since I hardly hesitate to invade.</li>
</ul>
[/expand]
[expand title=&#8221;My Review&#8221; trigclass=&#8221;expandTitle&#8221; expanded=&#8221;true&#8221;]
<strong>What did I enjoy about the book?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>There is an anecdote about a player who felt that &#8220;territory meant nothing unless it contained a dead group&#8221; that was incredibly eye-opening and changed the way I saw attacking groups.</li>
<li>Does a great job explaining topics (that previously seemed hard to grasp) such as power, forcing moves, inducing moves, etc.</li>
<li>The problems at the end of the book were a great way for me to see if I understood what I had been learning.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What did I gain from reading this book?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A much better understanding of attacking, defense, and the importance and role that power plays in a game.</li>
<li>An improvement in my ability to attack groups properly.</li>
<li>A better understanding of how to find multi-purpose moves that serve both attack and defense purposes.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What style of teaching does the book use?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Lecture Approach
<ul>
<li>The writing is far more substantial in this book than what readers might have become accustomed to in Tesuji and Life and Death.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Primary Learning Mechanism:
<ul>
<li>Explanations with diagrams</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Other Learning Mechanisms:
<ul>
<li>Practice problems</li>
<li>Examples from actual games</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What aspect(s) can be improved on?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>In all honesty, I have a hard time finding anything to criticize about this book; but if I had to request one thing, it would have to be more problems at the end of the book to continue reinforcing what I learned.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Is this book easy to read?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Yes. The writing style in this book makes you feel as if you are having a conversation with Davies and Ishida, which ultimately makes for an enjoyable read.</li>
</ul>
[/expand]
[expand title=&#8221;Recommended For&#8230;&#8221; trigclass=&#8221;expandTitle&#8221;]
<ul>
<li>Players looking for a reference on numerous shapes that are frequently encountered in games.</li>
<li>Players who have read other life and death books and are looking to expand their knowledge and test their skills.</li>
