				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 id="weeklygowednesdayissue45" style="text-align: center;">Weekly Go Wednesday, Issue #45</h2>
<h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>
<p>Introducing go to new people is a topic that I’m very passionate about and it’s something that I think a lot of people mess up. To be fair, it’s not their fault and they are not intentionally doing so. It’s just that people don’t realize how the lack or presence of certain teaching principles can have profoundly different results.<br />
I come from the belief that one day go will be known by the masses and played by all kinds of people. I don’t believe that it is a game for “smart” people and have no intention of seeing it get shelved as a niche of a game that only “intellectuals” play. Everything you’re about to read comes from personal experience and/or things that I have actually witnessed in real life, so there’s nothing theoretical about it. In addition, I have to emphasize that this “manifesto” focuses on people brand new to go. More established players are not considered below.<br />
With that said, let’s dive right into it shall we?<br />
<span id="more-5541"></span></p>
<h3 id="principle1:youarenotteachinggo.">Principle #1: You are not teaching go.</h3>
<p>Wait what? Isn’t this whole article about how to “teach” go? In one sense it is, but you’ll also notice that I put the team “teach” in quotes because I think it puts people in a completely incorrect mindset.<br />
When a person tries to teach something, I have found that they are always very quick to correct a person’s mistake. Once they get it in their heads that they are “teaching,” there is this sense of superiority and a desire to raise the “perfect student.”<br />
What do I mean by “perfect student?” Well what’s the ideal situation for introducing a new person to go? Easy. They become hooked and become obsessed with the game the way many of us are. However, the reality of it is that people of this mentality are far and few between.<br />
What most people often forget is that go is simply a game to most people. Like chess, checkers, or video games, it is just one way to pass the time and enjoy themselves. It is not something that they obsess over and try to improve at the way most of us do. As a result, the mindset needs to be completely different for these people.<br />
Teaching go is reserved for trying to help a player gain another stone in rank. This is not what you are doing. You are simply trying to help someone learn the rules of go and be able to play a game on their own. It doesn’t matter if their moves are great, or whether or not they make mistakes, they simply need to be able to play and you will have accomplished your goal.<br />
To put it another way, imagine that board games are like restaurants in a food court and the prospective customers’ appetites are their free time and energy. When a person comes into the food court looking to figure out where to eat, do you think that they are going to eat a three course meal at all the restaurants to figure out where they want to eat? Absolutely not! They wouldn’t have the stomach for it!<br />
So what’s the solution? The sample of course. You offer samples to all prospective customers because having them simply take the time to actually try your product is what you really need. If they like it, they’ll come in and enjoy all your restaurant has to offer. Or maybe they can’t sit down today, but because the sample you offered was great, they’ll come back another time. And worst case scenario, they don’t care much for it; but even in this scenario, at least they know what your food is and can tell people what it is.<br />
As a result, your goal is not to “teach” go; but to instead market and sell it to anyone willing to give you their time and attention. You are not a teacher. You are a go enthusiast who wants to share with everyone why go is awesome and why they should play it. And the way you are going to do that is not by teaching them the game, but by introducing the rules to them in a fun and easy way.</p>
<h3 id="principle2:keepitsimplestupidk.i.s.s..">Principle #2: Keep it simple stupid (K.I.S.S.).</h3>
<p>Whenever anyone is learning anything new, the most important thing is that they get to practice, practice, and practice. So what does that mean for us as we show them the ropes of how to play go? Stop trying to introduce new and advanced concepts when they’ve barely grasped how go works.<br />
Case and point. Let’s say you’ve just finished teaching someone how to capture stones. You ask them if they understand and they nod. At this point, you might feel compelled to the launch into this lengthy explanation about life and death or ko works; but don’t do it! That is one of the absolute worst things you could possibly do.<br />
You have to realize that thinking you understand something is WAY different than applying it. I cannot even count the number of times where the player told me that they “understood” what I had just explained but had a difficult time actually applying it in the game. For example, once we start playing first capture, the board will get slightly complicated, and if I ask them to identify which group they are able to capture with one move, they get confused and can’t find the group! This is by no means their fault, but it illustrates the point I’m trying to make in that it’s easy to think they grasped a concept when in fact they really haven’t.<br />
So I have a basic rule to follow, avoid the following topics when explaining the game or playing with a new player:</p>
<ol>
<li>Suicide</li>
<li>Ko</li>
<li>Life and Death</li>
<li>Tesujis</li>
<li>Komi</li>
<li>Shape Efficiency (like why empty triangles are bad)</li>
</ol>
<p>This sounds crazy to full-fledged go players, but I have seen countless beginners who play full games on a 9&#215;9 board without ever questioning those things. They delight and find joy in simply being able to play and apply what they just learned. After all, isn’t it much easier to play a game when there aren’t a bunch of exceptions to remember? Go has one of the simplest rulesets needed to start playing, so why complicate that?<br />
And to top it off, exceptions (like suicide and ko) are much easier to remember when they are discovered by the players themselves. There have been plenty of times when I was playing with a new player when they would stop me and go, “Wait a second. What about this?” In that case, by all means teach it to them! After all, if they are thinking at that level, it means they have grasped the other material which is great! Otherwise, let them practice with the simple ruleset as much as they want. After all, you want them to remember how to play the game the next day right?</p>
<h3 id="principle3.givethemasmanyopportunitiesforsuccessaspossible.">Principle #3. Give them as many opportunities for success as possible.</h3>
<p>When I had a chance to take a break from teaching last Saturday, I saw a classic scenario occurring on a number of the boards throughout the table: the new player was getting demolished and the person “teaching” had a bunch of stones as prisoners. I could only shake my head as my mind screamed, “Are you trying to discourage him from playing go?!?!”<br />
I understand that there are some players who relish in getting crushed and see it as a challenge, but I <strong><em>guarantee</em></strong> you that most people you will be introducing the game to will <strong><em>not</em></strong> be like this at all. In fact, even something as simple as not grasping the rules is often reason enough for most people to walk away from learning a game. So imagine what it would be like if you are struggling to grasp the rules and getting destroyed at the same time. I don’t know about you, but I probably wouldn’t be playing this game any time soon. And that is precisely what we <strong>don’t</strong> want.<br />
If you take a moment and think about successful games or apps, they tend to share one common functionality: they have really intuitive tutorials that make it very easy to go through because each level of accomplishment is often as simple as a touch or a swipe on your screen. In other words, they make it fun for someone to pick up the basics so that they can easily transition into the more advanced features later on.<br />
In the same spirit, I strongly believe that go should be taught in the same manner. People respond well when they feel like they are accomplishing something or doing well at something. As a result, it is critical that they are given as many opportunities as possible to feel that way. By doing so, you will improve the chances that they will actually remember how to play the game the next day and maybe even share it with others one day.</p>
<h3 id="mybasiccurriculumforbrandnewplayers">My Basic Curriculum for Brand New Players</h3>
<p>Of course, some of you are wondering how I introduce new players to the game. While I’m still working out the kinks and plan to eventually release a detailed curriculum, here’s the general outline:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Start with the absolute basics of the game.</strong> Use other games that most people are familiar with to start differentiating the most basic rules of go. For example, in chess and checkers, you place pieces in the square. In go, we put the pieces on the intersections.</li>
<li><strong>Explain the concept of liberties and give them plenty of opportunity of practice for counting the liberties of stones.</strong> This is a really easy way to give them opportunities for accomplishing things and feeling like they are making progress.</li>
<li><strong>If time permits, I give them practice scenarios for capturing stones to further reinforce the idea of liberties and capturing.</strong> So you would make a shape with your stones and surround it except for it’s last liberty, and then have the person play the correct move to capture the group.</li>
<li><strong>We play a couple games of first capture on a 9&#215;9 board.</strong> (1) I refrain from using any tesujis and constantly leave weaknesses open for the new player to spot. (2) I constantly let them undo and encourage it in fact. (3) My goal is not to win, but to give them continuous opportunities to practice and reinforce what we just learned.</li>
<li><strong>If they are still interested in taking the next step in learning about go, then that’s when I explain the concept of territory and its importance in determining how one wins or loses in go.</strong> People often have trouble understanding this part, but I make the analogy of war and two parties coming to sign a peace treaty and they usually understand.</li>
<li><strong>Finally, I give them either 6–9 stones handicap (on a 9&#215;9 board) depending on how fast they grasped the other concepts and play with them.</strong> Yes, the handicap is ridiculous, but it doesn’t matter because I’m not trying to win. I simply want them to play. If they are playing and spending more time on the game, I’m accomplished my goal.</li>
</ol>
<p>And just to reiterate from Principle #2, I avoid all the exceptions to the rules (like ko, suicide, etc.) and nuances unless the player asks me about it or it naturally occurs in a game. But for the most part, I avoid letting situations like ko arise for the sheer fact that I want the player spending as much time soaking up and reinforcing the basic rules of go as long as I possibly can.</p>
<h3 id="otheradvicefrommyexperience">Other Advice from My Experience</h3>
<ol>
<li><strong>Don’t kill any big groups</strong>. If you’re playing a 9&#215;9 board game and you notice that a group only has one eye, don’t try to kill it. In fact, you should actually try to play in a way that makes him live without him realizing it.</li>
<li><strong>If the score is going to end up in the negative points, you better be the one with the negative score.</strong> As an experienced go player, you should not take any pleasure in crushing a new player and leaving them with negative points. In fact, you should feel ashamed if you let the game become that way. If anyone should have negative points, let it be you.</li>
<li><strong>Even if a group only has one eye at the end of the game (9&#215;9), I just let it live and count the points.</strong> This is probably hard for a lot of players to do, but I honestly see no value in pointing out that their group is dead. New players won’t know that you let it slide and it prevents them from feeling like they suffered a humiliating defeat. And to be honest, once you’re done showing how the game ends and score is counted, you are usually moving on to the next game. So what’s the point?</li>
</ol>
<p>So to end this long rant, at the end of the day, you have to remember this key fact: people have no obligation to learn, play, or even remember what the game of go is. It doesn’t matter if they never get ranked or never play on a 19&#215;19 board. If you can get them to remember what the game is and vaguely how to play it, you’ve already done an immense service to the go community. And maybe, just maybe, one day we will live in a world where people will stop coming up to me and ask if I’m playing othello.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Blank.png"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-988" title="Empty Board" src="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Blank-300x300.png?resize=300%2C300" alt="Empty Board by Eidogo" width="300" height="300" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Go Problem: Black to play and win.</em></p>
<p>For those who are skeptical of the importance of the correct approach to studying tsumego, let&#8217;s consider the following:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">#1. <strong>Your reading ability is the primary foundation for your go ability.</strong> If you can&#8217;t read worth diddly squat, don&#8217;t expect to get any stronger.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">#2. <strong>It&#8217;s the most convenient form of go that is available to players if they&#8217;re unable to play an actual game.</strong> So why not make it an enjoyable activity that will help you get stronger?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">#3. Finally, since most go players will spend a good portion of their time on tsumego, <strong>it is only logical that you would want to maximize the growth you&#8217;ll get from the time and energy you spend on it</strong>.</p>
<p>That being said. Let&#8217;s dive right into how one should properly study tsumego.<br />
<strong>#1. As a rule of thumb, spend at least 75% of your time on easy problems.</strong>*</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"> If you primarily focus on hard problems, there are three issues that will arise.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">A. You will get frustrated because you are going to be wrong most of the time and will be unable to see why you&#8217;re wrong. Therefore, you will not learn or gain much.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">B. Although you would think that learning how to solve hard problems would result in you being able to solve easy problems, this is rarely the case for tsumego.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">C. Finally, you must understand that every game of go you play consists of a majority of easy to intermediate level problems, and then a handful of complicated situations. So instead of understanding the proper moves to make for most of the game and being a little lost for only a small part of the game, you hope to win a game where you make mistakes during the majority of the game and make the occassional correct move for a small part of the game? You might want to think twice about this approach if you want to win any games.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">With that in mind, isn&#8217;t the only logical thing to do is train your intuition so that your basics become flawless? After all, once the basics become instinctual, you will not even have to consider the trivial moves that once plagued your mind. Instead, you will now be able to focus on more complicated situations that will ultimately allow to rise in strength and ability.</p>
<p><em>*If you&#8217;re wondering what qualifies as easy, it means that you can read out all of the variations in your head with minimal effort.</em><br />
<strong>#2. If you use tsumego software, do not get in the habit of just playing things out because you can.</strong><br />
The short version of the rationale for this is that tsumego software permits you to be lazy by letting the software show why something is wrong. This is a habit that will not only fail to help you improve your reading ability, but will deteriorate it instead. For a more detailed explanation on this topic, visit <a title="Tsumego: Books vs. Software" href="//go-problems-books-vs-software/">this post</a>.<br />
<strong>3. If you do not understand why your variation does not work, stop and figure it out before moving on.</strong><br />
Although this piece of advice will be difficult to follow as you grow in strength, this is one of those things that will truly help to fill the void where you are not seeing the issue with your variation. If you take the time to properly understand which counter moves negate your solution, it will serve as a big boost to your abilities over time because you will begin to see variations you could never see before. And if you feel like you&#8217;ve tried everything (even though in reality you haven&#8217;t) and feel strongly that the book is wrong, get a stronger player to help you figure it out. I&#8217;ve done this a number of times and without fail, there was always one variation that I left out.<br />
Well I hope that this will get you on the right path to studying tsumego. If you have anything you&#8217;d like to add from your own experience, please leave a comment and I&#8217;ll be sure to revise the post with ideas that other players can make use of!<br />

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>So you&#8217;ve decided to find out what responsibilities come with purchasing Yunzi stones, well don&#8217;t fear!  Here is an easy to follow guide. Enjoy!</em><br />
<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Why Take the Extra Time to Oil the Stones?</span></strong><br />
It&#8217;s true. You don&#8217;t HAVE to oil the stones.  Yunzi stones will naturally become glossier and smoother the more you play with them since you hands naturally produces oil.  I don&#8217;t know about you however, but I&#8217;d be an old man by the time it would take the stones to be pleasant to the touch with the oil my hand produces.  Not to mention that most of us don&#8217;t get to play as often in person as we&#8217;d like.  If you&#8217;re not interested in waiting 50 years for them to achieve the effect that oiling can get in an hour or two, then you&#8217;ll want to read the entire guide.  For those who don&#8217;t care, then all you need is up till Phase 1.<br />
<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Materials (Depends on whether you want to oil the stones simultaneously)</span></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Yunzi stones</li>
<li>Dishwashing Soap</li>
<li>~15 or ~30 drops of Light machine oil (e.g. sewing machine oil)
<ul>
<li><strong>Note: Do NOT use oils such as vegetable (oil/canola) because they will go RANCID over time.</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>1 or 2 One-gallon freezer bag(s) (depending if you want to oil them at the same time)</li>
<li>2 Towels (Large enough to wrap around all of one color at once, otherwise you need more)</li>
<li>Non-metal strain (something to drain water but it CANNOT be metallic)
<ul>
<li>Metallic strainers can cause a lot of scratches on your stones.  So avoid it on the safe side.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<div style="text-align: center;"><a style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;" href="https://i2.wp.com/1.bp.blogspot.com/_R3zwHD97QhU/TK3LkQyMtVI/AAAAAAAAAS8/K2Zh3tTlfdE/s1600/IMG_1579.JPG"><img src="https://i2.wp.com/1.bp.blogspot.com/_R3zwHD97QhU/TK3LkQyMtVI/AAAAAAAAAS8/K2Zh3tTlfdE/s200/IMG_1579.JPG?resize=150%2C200" alt="" width="150" height="200" border="0" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></div>
<div style="text-align: center;"></div>
<p>Most of us have most of the materials above except the sewing machine oil, and let me tell you that sewing machine oil is NOT expensive.  I got mine (pictured above) at a Jo-Ann&#8217;s Fabric for only $2.95 + tax.  Not to mention you only need like 20 drops or so of it (a little bit more if you oiling the stones simultaneously).  So if someone is willing to let you borrow theirs, no worries about using up their oil.</p>
<div style="text-align: left;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Advice Prior to Starting</span></strong></div>
<ol>
<li>Although most of the steps are relatively simple, drying the oil off the stones at the end will be particularly time consuming.  This guide assumes that you will be doing both colors in the same sitting and by your little lonesome (as I did), so estimate at least an hour and a half for the whole process.  (Two if you want to be extra attentive to your stones).
<ul>
<li>I&#8217;ve broken the guide into three phases in case you are short on time.  And of course, if you want to break it up further. Just do the colors on separate days.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I would advise to keep the colors separated throughout the process in order to easily keep track of your work.  I suggest doing the white stones first since they take more effort and are not as fun to do as the black ones.</li>
<li>Just to reiterate, DO NOT use vegetable oils.  They will go RANCID.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Procedure</span></strong></p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><strong>PHASE 1 BEGIN</strong></div>
<p><strong></strong>#1. So here&#8217;s what my stones looked like when I first got them.  The stones all come with a white powdery substance in order to minimize scratching and chipping during shipping.  As you&#8217;ll see, the black stones show the powder really well while the white ones&#8230; not so much.</p>

<div style="text-align: center;"><em>I forgot to take one before washing, so the white ones are in there right now.</em></div>
<p>#4. Then you&#8217;ll add a moderate amount of dishwashing soap to get it nice and bubbly.  This was about how much I had.  Don&#8217;t put too much, since it&#8217;ll make washing off a pain later.</p>
<div style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;" href="https://i2.wp.com/3.bp.blogspot.com/_R3zwHD97QhU/TK3LWbSIOEI/AAAAAAAAASg/7CkN6pT7u0Y/s1600/IMG_1567.JPG"><img src="https://i0.wp.com/3.bp.blogspot.com/_R3zwHD97QhU/TK3LWbSIOEI/AAAAAAAAASg/7CkN6pT7u0Y/s320/IMG_1567.JPG?resize=320%2C240" alt="" width="320" height="240" border="0" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></div>
<div style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div>
<div style="clear: both; text-align: left;">#5. To wash your stones, submerge them in the soapy water and hand wash them.  You don&#8217;t need to be particularly detailed with this part, but try and make sure you wash off any obvious white powder since it&#8217;ll get in the way of oiling later.  Once you finish with the soap, rinse them off with water.  Dump them out onto the towel, and dry them off well before oiling.</div>

<strong>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;</strong></div>
<div style="text-align: center;"><strong>PHASE 2 BEGIN</strong></div>
<div style="clear: both; text-align: left;">#6. To oil your stones, take your gallon bag and put 12 drops of oil in there.  Now most guides out there recommend 12, but others want to put a few more in just to make sure they are extra oil.  It won&#8217;t hurt as far as I can tell, but you will want to pay a bit more attention to drying your stones afterwards so no excess oils stay on.  Then throw whichever color (I recommend white), and then gently move the stones around making sure to spread the oil around to all of the stones.</div>
<div style="clear: both; text-align: left;"></div>
<div style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;" href="https://i2.wp.com/3.bp.blogspot.com/_R3zwHD97QhU/TK3LmJ_4PwI/AAAAAAAAATA/Ays7OsRfJ9Y/s1600/IMG_1585.JPG"><img src="https://i2.wp.com/3.bp.blogspot.com/_R3zwHD97QhU/TK3LmJ_4PwI/AAAAAAAAATA/Ays7OsRfJ9Y/s320/IMG_1585.JPG?resize=240%2C320" alt="" width="240" height="320" border="0" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></div>
<div style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div>
<div style="clear: both; text-align: left;">#7. If you are short on time, this is where you take your second one-gallon freezer bag and oil that up as well with ~12 drops of oil and throw in the other color.  Mix that bag up just like you did the first one, and then you can let both bags sit.  (In case you are wondering if it is bad to do that, my dad let his sit for about 48 hours and they&#8217;re just fine.)</div>
<div style="clear: both; text-align: left;"></div>
<div style="clear: both; text-align: left;">Note: If you are only going to use one freezer bag, then you have two choices:  dry off the color which is oiled first, and then oil the other one&#8230; OR&#8230; if your stones are not too large for the bag, put both in at once.</div>
<div style="clear: both; text-align: left;"></div>
<div style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><strong>PHASE 2 END</strong></div>
<div style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><strong>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;</strong></div>
<div style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><strong>PHASE 3 BEGIN</strong></div>
<p><strong></strong><br />
<strong></strong></p>
<div style="font-weight: normal; text-align: center; margin: 0px;">
<div style="text-align: left;"><strong></strong>#8. This is the most tedious and time consuming phase.  You&#8217;ll begin by emptying out your stones in small groups at a time.  This will help you keep track of which ones are done and this will also permit you the proper towel space to dry your oiled stones without them falling everywhere.  Again, I recommend starting with white since black is very pleasant to do since you&#8217;ll see a very obvious change in them.</div>
</div>
<p>#9.  Then you&#8217;ll go ahead and dry them off.  It is important that you don&#8217;t leave any excess oil on them because it will cause your stones/bowls to smell and the excess oil will most likely damage your board over time.  If you pick a properly dried off stones with your hand, and then pick up one with excess oil, you&#8217;ll know the difference.  So just be disciplined about this phase.  The white stones will need more individual attention since it is harder to tell whether there is still excess oil on them.</p>
<div style="clear: both; text-align: left;"></div>
<div style="clear: both; text-align: left;">Tip: As you dry them, try to keep drying the stones with the same area of towel so that it will increase the oiling effect.</div>
<div style="clear: both; text-align: left;"></div>
<div style="clear: both; text-align: left;">Tip: Also, if you can get a friend to help.  This will speed the process a LOT.  Just make sure they are attentive about the excess oils on the stones, otherwise you might as well do it yourself.</div>
<div style="clear: both; text-align: left;"></div>
<div style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><strong>PHASE 3 END</strong></div>
<div style="clear: both; text-align: left;"></div>
<div style="clear: both; text-align: left;">#10. Finished product.  You have no idea how good it felt to take these pictures.  I felt so proud.</div>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="color: #800000;"><em>WARNING: Contrary to my previous findings, it seems that Blogger may actually not be compatible period with Eidogo anymore. Let me know if you find otherwise.</em></span></strong></p>
<h3>Part 1: Putting the program into your blog.</h3>
<ol>
<li>Access the control panel for your blog.</li>
<li>Click <strong>Template</strong>.</li>
<li>Click <strong>Edit</strong> <strong>HTML</strong>.</li>
<li>A popup will appear that warns you the implications of editing HTML. Nothing to fear. Click <strong>Proceed</strong>.</li>
<li>Once your text editor appears, search for the tag <strong>&lt;/head&gt;.</strong></li>
<li>Move your text cursor to the beginning of the tag and press the <strong>Enter</strong>/<strong>Return</strong> key to create an empty line.</li>
<li>Copy and paste the following code in the new line break you just created.
<ul>
<li>&lt;script type=&#8221;text/javascript&#8221; src=&#8221;http://www.eidogo.com/player/js/all.compressed.js&#8221;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Click <strong>Save</strong> <strong>template</strong>.</li>
<li>Part 1 complete!</li>
</ol>
<h3>Part 2: Preparing your kifu for embedding.</h3>
<ol>
<li>Download your desired kifu (which should be an SGF file).</li>
<li>Open the SGF file in a text editor (e.g., Notepad).</li>
<li>At the very beginning of the document, paste the following code:
<ul>
<li>&lt;div class=&#8221;eidogo-player-auto&#8221;&gt;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Go to the very end of the document, paste the following code:
<ul>
<li>&lt;/div&gt;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Select the entire text and copy it.</li>
<li>Part 2 complete!</li>
</ol>
<h3>Part 3: Inserting your kifu into the post.</h3>
<ol>
<li>Edit the post that you want to embed the sgf file into.</li>
<li>On the left side above the text area, you should see two option: Compose | HTML, make sure that <strong>Compose</strong> is selected (it should have a darker gray background that looks as if it is indented).</li>
<li>Move your text cursor to the area in the post that you want to post the SGF file to.</li>
<li>Type <strong>PASTE SGF FILE</strong>.</li>
<li>Click on the <strong>HTML</strong> tab mentioned in Step #5.</li>
<li>Find the text you typed in Step #4. It should look something like this:
<ul>
<li>&lt;div&gt;PASTE SGF FILE&lt;/div&gt;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Highlight the entire code mentioned in Step #6.</li>
<li>Paste copied text from Part 2.</li>
<li>Click <strong>Save</strong> or <strong>Publish</strong>.</li>
<li>Success!</li>
</ol>
<h4>Disclaimers:</h4>
<ul>
<li>The Eidogo Viewer will not appear in the preview nor will it appear in the compose section. It&#8217;ll just look like a gigantic text version of your sgf file. Don&#8217;t worry though! It works on the actual site.</li>
<li>In case anyone is using SmartGo2 to create/modify their SGF file, the code they produce will cause Eidogo to not see the proper handicap, the players and their respective colors, komi, along with any commentary made throughout the game. As a result, I recommend that you use <a href="http://www.gokgs.com/download.jsp" target="_blank">CGoban</a> instead.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>Many thanks to Nate for helping me create this guide and Eidogo for creating an amazing viewer!!</em></span></p>
