				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 id="weeklygowednesdayissue45" style="text-align: center;">Weekly Go Wednesday, Issue #45</h2>
<h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>
<p>Introducing go to new people is a topic that I’m very passionate about and it’s something that I think a lot of people mess up. To be fair, it’s not their fault and they are not intentionally doing so. It’s just that people don’t realize how the lack or presence of certain teaching principles can have profoundly different results.<br />
I come from the belief that one day go will be known by the masses and played by all kinds of people. I don’t believe that it is a game for “smart” people and have no intention of seeing it get shelved as a niche of a game that only “intellectuals” play. Everything you’re about to read comes from personal experience and/or things that I have actually witnessed in real life, so there’s nothing theoretical about it. In addition, I have to emphasize that this “manifesto” focuses on people brand new to go. More established players are not considered below.<br />
With that said, let’s dive right into it shall we?<br />
<span id="more-5541"></span></p>
<h3 id="principle1:youarenotteachinggo.">Principle #1: You are not teaching go.</h3>
<p>Wait what? Isn’t this whole article about how to “teach” go? In one sense it is, but you’ll also notice that I put the team “teach” in quotes because I think it puts people in a completely incorrect mindset.<br />
When a person tries to teach something, I have found that they are always very quick to correct a person’s mistake. Once they get it in their heads that they are “teaching,” there is this sense of superiority and a desire to raise the “perfect student.”<br />
What do I mean by “perfect student?” Well what’s the ideal situation for introducing a new person to go? Easy. They become hooked and become obsessed with the game the way many of us are. However, the reality of it is that people of this mentality are far and few between.<br />
What most people often forget is that go is simply a game to most people. Like chess, checkers, or video games, it is just one way to pass the time and enjoy themselves. It is not something that they obsess over and try to improve at the way most of us do. As a result, the mindset needs to be completely different for these people.<br />
Teaching go is reserved for trying to help a player gain another stone in rank. This is not what you are doing. You are simply trying to help someone learn the rules of go and be able to play a game on their own. It doesn’t matter if their moves are great, or whether or not they make mistakes, they simply need to be able to play and you will have accomplished your goal.<br />
To put it another way, imagine that board games are like restaurants in a food court and the prospective customers’ appetites are their free time and energy. When a person comes into the food court looking to figure out where to eat, do you think that they are going to eat a three course meal at all the restaurants to figure out where they want to eat? Absolutely not! They wouldn’t have the stomach for it!<br />
So what’s the solution? The sample of course. You offer samples to all prospective customers because having them simply take the time to actually try your product is what you really need. If they like it, they’ll come in and enjoy all your restaurant has to offer. Or maybe they can’t sit down today, but because the sample you offered was great, they’ll come back another time. And worst case scenario, they don’t care much for it; but even in this scenario, at least they know what your food is and can tell people what it is.<br />
As a result, your goal is not to “teach” go; but to instead market and sell it to anyone willing to give you their time and attention. You are not a teacher. You are a go enthusiast who wants to share with everyone why go is awesome and why they should play it. And the way you are going to do that is not by teaching them the game, but by introducing the rules to them in a fun and easy way.</p>
<h3 id="principle2:keepitsimplestupidk.i.s.s..">Principle #2: Keep it simple stupid (K.I.S.S.).</h3>
<p>Whenever anyone is learning anything new, the most important thing is that they get to practice, practice, and practice. So what does that mean for us as we show them the ropes of how to play go? Stop trying to introduce new and advanced concepts when they’ve barely grasped how go works.<br />
Case and point. Let’s say you’ve just finished teaching someone how to capture stones. You ask them if they understand and they nod. At this point, you might feel compelled to the launch into this lengthy explanation about life and death or ko works; but don’t do it! That is one of the absolute worst things you could possibly do.<br />
You have to realize that thinking you understand something is WAY different than applying it. I cannot even count the number of times where the player told me that they “understood” what I had just explained but had a difficult time actually applying it in the game. For example, once we start playing first capture, the board will get slightly complicated, and if I ask them to identify which group they are able to capture with one move, they get confused and can’t find the group! This is by no means their fault, but it illustrates the point I’m trying to make in that it’s easy to think they grasped a concept when in fact they really haven’t.<br />
So I have a basic rule to follow, avoid the following topics when explaining the game or playing with a new player:</p>
<ol>
<li>Suicide</li>
<li>Ko</li>
<li>Life and Death</li>
<li>Tesujis</li>
<li>Komi</li>
<li>Shape Efficiency (like why empty triangles are bad)</li>
</ol>
<p>This sounds crazy to full-fledged go players, but I have seen countless beginners who play full games on a 9&#215;9 board without ever questioning those things. They delight and find joy in simply being able to play and apply what they just learned. After all, isn’t it much easier to play a game when there aren’t a bunch of exceptions to remember? Go has one of the simplest rulesets needed to start playing, so why complicate that?<br />
And to top it off, exceptions (like suicide and ko) are much easier to remember when they are discovered by the players themselves. There have been plenty of times when I was playing with a new player when they would stop me and go, “Wait a second. What about this?” In that case, by all means teach it to them! After all, if they are thinking at that level, it means they have grasped the other material which is great! Otherwise, let them practice with the simple ruleset as much as they want. After all, you want them to remember how to play the game the next day right?</p>
<h3 id="principle3.givethemasmanyopportunitiesforsuccessaspossible.">Principle #3. Give them as many opportunities for success as possible.</h3>
<p>When I had a chance to take a break from teaching last Saturday, I saw a classic scenario occurring on a number of the boards throughout the table: the new player was getting demolished and the person “teaching” had a bunch of stones as prisoners. I could only shake my head as my mind screamed, “Are you trying to discourage him from playing go?!?!”<br />
I understand that there are some players who relish in getting crushed and see it as a challenge, but I <strong><em>guarantee</em></strong> you that most people you will be introducing the game to will <strong><em>not</em></strong> be like this at all. In fact, even something as simple as not grasping the rules is often reason enough for most people to walk away from learning a game. So imagine what it would be like if you are struggling to grasp the rules and getting destroyed at the same time. I don’t know about you, but I probably wouldn’t be playing this game any time soon. And that is precisely what we <strong>don’t</strong> want.<br />
If you take a moment and think about successful games or apps, they tend to share one common functionality: they have really intuitive tutorials that make it very easy to go through because each level of accomplishment is often as simple as a touch or a swipe on your screen. In other words, they make it fun for someone to pick up the basics so that they can easily transition into the more advanced features later on.<br />
In the same spirit, I strongly believe that go should be taught in the same manner. People respond well when they feel like they are accomplishing something or doing well at something. As a result, it is critical that they are given as many opportunities as possible to feel that way. By doing so, you will improve the chances that they will actually remember how to play the game the next day and maybe even share it with others one day.</p>
<h3 id="mybasiccurriculumforbrandnewplayers">My Basic Curriculum for Brand New Players</h3>
<p>Of course, some of you are wondering how I introduce new players to the game. While I’m still working out the kinks and plan to eventually release a detailed curriculum, here’s the general outline:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Start with the absolute basics of the game.</strong> Use other games that most people are familiar with to start differentiating the most basic rules of go. For example, in chess and checkers, you place pieces in the square. In go, we put the pieces on the intersections.</li>
<li><strong>Explain the concept of liberties and give them plenty of opportunity of practice for counting the liberties of stones.</strong> This is a really easy way to give them opportunities for accomplishing things and feeling like they are making progress.</li>
<li><strong>If time permits, I give them practice scenarios for capturing stones to further reinforce the idea of liberties and capturing.</strong> So you would make a shape with your stones and surround it except for it’s last liberty, and then have the person play the correct move to capture the group.</li>
<li><strong>We play a couple games of first capture on a 9&#215;9 board.</strong> (1) I refrain from using any tesujis and constantly leave weaknesses open for the new player to spot. (2) I constantly let them undo and encourage it in fact. (3) My goal is not to win, but to give them continuous opportunities to practice and reinforce what we just learned.</li>
<li><strong>If they are still interested in taking the next step in learning about go, then that’s when I explain the concept of territory and its importance in determining how one wins or loses in go.</strong> People often have trouble understanding this part, but I make the analogy of war and two parties coming to sign a peace treaty and they usually understand.</li>
<li><strong>Finally, I give them either 6–9 stones handicap (on a 9&#215;9 board) depending on how fast they grasped the other concepts and play with them.</strong> Yes, the handicap is ridiculous, but it doesn’t matter because I’m not trying to win. I simply want them to play. If they are playing and spending more time on the game, I’m accomplished my goal.</li>
</ol>
<p>And just to reiterate from Principle #2, I avoid all the exceptions to the rules (like ko, suicide, etc.) and nuances unless the player asks me about it or it naturally occurs in a game. But for the most part, I avoid letting situations like ko arise for the sheer fact that I want the player spending as much time soaking up and reinforcing the basic rules of go as long as I possibly can.</p>
<h3 id="otheradvicefrommyexperience">Other Advice from My Experience</h3>
<ol>
<li><strong>Don’t kill any big groups</strong>. If you’re playing a 9&#215;9 board game and you notice that a group only has one eye, don’t try to kill it. In fact, you should actually try to play in a way that makes him live without him realizing it.</li>
<li><strong>If the score is going to end up in the negative points, you better be the one with the negative score.</strong> As an experienced go player, you should not take any pleasure in crushing a new player and leaving them with negative points. In fact, you should feel ashamed if you let the game become that way. If anyone should have negative points, let it be you.</li>
<li><strong>Even if a group only has one eye at the end of the game (9&#215;9), I just let it live and count the points.</strong> This is probably hard for a lot of players to do, but I honestly see no value in pointing out that their group is dead. New players won’t know that you let it slide and it prevents them from feeling like they suffered a humiliating defeat. And to be honest, once you’re done showing how the game ends and score is counted, you are usually moving on to the next game. So what’s the point?</li>
</ol>
<p>So to end this long rant, at the end of the day, you have to remember this key fact: people have no obligation to learn, play, or even remember what the game of go is. It doesn’t matter if they never get ranked or never play on a 19&#215;19 board. If you can get them to remember what the game is and vaguely how to play it, you’ve already done an immense service to the go community. And maybe, just maybe, one day we will live in a world where people will stop coming up to me and ask if I’m playing othello.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Introduction</h2>
<p>After much waiting and anticipation, I&#8217;m happy to release the final post on my Hong Kong trip. Since we always save the best for last, it should come as no surprise to you that you had to wait till the very end to hear about my go adventures! Before we go on however, I just wanted to clarify a couple of things. (1) The title of this post was originally &#8220;Go,&#8221; but due to the fact that I was in Hong Kong, I felt it was only appropriate to title it &#8220;Weiqi.&#8221; (2) However, in order to ease the readability of my post, I will be using &#8220;go&#8221; in the text instead of &#8220;weiqi&#8221; for simple consistency with English go literature. With that said, onwards with my go adventure in Hong Kong!</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Part 3 &#8211; Weiqi</h2>
<p>As I&#8217;m sure some of you remember, I posted on <a title="Reddit Hong Kong Post" href="http://www.reddit.com/r/baduk/comments/2059yl/go_players_clubs_in_hong_kong/">reddit</a> and <a title="Preparing for My Hong Kong Trip" href="//preparing-hong-kong-trip/">here</a> before the trip to see if anyone was in the area. Most of the feedback I got from people was that I should visit the <a title="Hong Kong Go Association Website" href="http://www.hkga.org.hk/">Hong Kong Go Association (HKGA)</a>. I was a little saddened by the fact that I was unable to find anyone who lived locally online, but I knew that I couldn&#8217;t bear the idea of going all the way to Asia and not do a single go-related activity. So I promised myself that if I were to do anything for myself this trip, it would be to visit the HKGA.<br />
When we first arrived in Hong Kong, one of the things we did was to go to one of the shopping districts. And believe it or not, as I&#8217;m walking down the street, I see this across the street.<br />
<figure id="attachment_5043" style="width: 640px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014HKP3-01.jpg"><img class="size-large wp-image-5043" alt="2014HKP3-01" src="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014HKP3-01-1024x768.jpg?resize=640%2C480" width="640" height="480" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Wait&#8230; why does that cartoon character look like he&#8217;s doing something I&#8217;m terribly familiar with&#8230;</figcaption></figure>

<figure id="attachment_5044" style="width: 640px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014HKP3-02.jpg"><img class="size-large wp-image-5044" alt="2014HKP3-02" src="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014HKP3-02-1024x768.jpg?resize=640%2C480" width="640" height="480" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Oh&#8230;. my&#8230;.. Sai!!!!!!</figcaption></figure>
Yep. It was an ad for go on a bus. No it wasn&#8217;t some special bus for the HKGA. It was just your normal run of the mill bus with an ad for HKGA. You have no idea how excited I was to see it at the time. Haha. I probably even looked a little crazy to the people around as I&#8217;m pointing excitedly and trying to tell my family to look at the epicness painted on the bus.<br />
Now if anyone has visited the HKGA website, you&#8217;ll notice that it&#8217;s entirely in Chinese without any English version. And while I may be able to read and write Mandarin, trying to read a web page full of Chinese is a huge struggle for me since my Chinese is still rather basic.<br />
One of the things I noticed on the site was that there were classes being held at night throughout the week. They would cost money, but that didn&#8217;t bother me since it would be a brand new experience for me. So I had my mom call them (because I can&#8217;t speak Cantonese), and we find out that the classes were not actually running at the time.<br />
When my mom told me that, I then asked if they had a time where local players would come and play. As you might imagine, I was envisioning the HKGA to be something like the Nihon Ki-in in Japan where there&#8217;s a go salon in the building with a bunch of people playing throughout the day. To my surprise and disappointment, the secretary told my mom that they didn&#8217;t have anything like that.<br />
I was pretty bummed to hear that. After all, would my epic go adventure in Hong Kong be reduced to simply visiting the HKGA and maybe taking a few pictures? All hope was nearly gone until the secretary told my mom that I could take private lessons if I wanted to.<br />
After some back and forth, I found out that my teacher would be an amateur who was around 6-7 dan. He could speak Mandarin and English as well, so language wouldn&#8217;t be an issue. The only obstacle in my way was that it would be about $100USD for a lesson.<br />
I wrestled with the decision for a while. After all, $100USD is not cheap by any stretch of the imagination. However, for those who don&#8217;t know me, I&#8217;m more of the seize life by the moment kind of person. Since I had no idea when I would go back to Hong Kong, I ultimately decided to schedule a lesson for the next day in the morning at 10:00AM.<br />
The next day, I woke up excited to embark on my go adventure. My mom asked if I knew where I was going, and I told her that I had the address (252 Hennessy Road; Wan Chai; Hong Kong) already. I had confirmed it via Google maps and also a redditor had also told me the same address. Just to be safe though, my family was kind enough to be willing to go with me (in case I needed help getting around), so off we went.<br />
<figure id="attachment_5045" style="width: 640px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014HKP3-03.jpg"><img class="size-large wp-image-5045" alt="2014HKP3-03" src="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014HKP3-03-1024x682.jpg?resize=640%2C426" width="640" height="426" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">In Hong Kong, this is the symbol for the metro / subway line.

After grabbing breakfast, we found ourselves the nearest metro line and headed off towards 252 Hennessy Road; Wan Chai; Hong Kong.<br />
<figure id="attachment_5046" style="width: 640px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014HKP3-04.jpg"><img class="size-large wp-image-5046" alt="2014HKP3-04" src="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014HKP3-04-1024x768.jpg?resize=640%2C480" width="640" height="480" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">The metro system is also way better than DC. Look. They have a map with electronic LED&#8217;s to show you where you are and what stop is next. Brilliant!</figcaption></figure>
Because I didn&#8217;t want to be late, we arrived with plenty of time to spare (around 9:30AM).<br />
<figure id="attachment_5047" style="width: 640px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014HKP3-05.jpg"><img class="size-large wp-image-5047" alt="2014HKP3-05" src="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014HKP3-05-1024x768.jpg?resize=640%2C480" width="640" height="480" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Woohoo! Here we are! The Hong Kong Go Association at 252 Hennessy Road; Wan Chai; Hong Kong.</figcaption></figure>
After finding the location, I turned around to look for the doorway and was instead greeted by a kind of creepy looking entrance.<br />
<figure id="attachment_5048" style="width: 384px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014HKP3-06.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-5048 " alt="2014HKP3-06" src="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014HKP3-06-768x1024.jpg?resize=384%2C512" width="384" height="512" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Tell me I&#8217;m not the only one who thought this looked like a scene out of a horror movie like Saw or something&#8230;</figcaption></figure>
After buzzing and waiting around for 15-20 minutes, I got a little nervous as I was wondering whether or not the teacher had bailed on me. I had tried to sneak into the metal door earlier to go in and see if anyone was around, but I got chased out by some elderly Asian gentlemen (who seemed to be the security guard). He told me that no one was upstairs and that no one was planning on being there. Uh oh&#8230;<br />
Around 9:55AM, we get a call from the secretary my mom spoke to last night. She asked if we were still coming. &#8220;Still coming?&#8221; my mom said, &#8220;We&#8217;re waiting outside!&#8221; After about ten seconds had passed, a feeling of dread washed over me&#8230; Sure enough, my mom turns to be and says, &#8220;We&#8217;re in the wrong location! This is not the correct place! They are actually located around the place we were eating breakfast!&#8221;<br />
<figure id="attachment_5074" style="width: 330px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/nooooooo_luke_skywalker.gif"><img class="size-full wp-image-5074" alt="Noooooo!!!!!!" src="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/nooooooo_luke_skywalker.gif?resize=330%2C186" width="330" height="186" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Noooooo!!!!!!</figcaption></figure>
<p style="text-align: left;">Needless to say I was utterly blown and felt terrible since someone had come to teach me and I was about 20-30 minutes away from where they were. Luckily however, the teacher was not in a rush to leave and was willing to wait for me to go to the correct location.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">At this point, I had dragged my family on a 30 minute journey to a new part of the city. I could not bear the notion of dragging them 30 minutes back just so I could go to the HKGA. So  so I told them to go ahead and stay and explore the new part of the city. And with that, I ran off to find the place myself.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">So if you&#8217;re wondering at this point, this is the correct address: <strong>12/F, May May Building, No. 683-685 Nathan Road, Mongkok</strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">After navigating my way back to Mongkok, I started looking for the sign that would signal me that I had found the building.</p>
<figure id="attachment_5049" style="width: 640px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014HKP3-07.jpg"><img class="size-large wp-image-5049" alt="2014HKP3-07" src="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014HKP3-07-1024x768.jpg?resize=640%2C480" width="640" height="480" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">This is it! In case you ever are visiting, this is the sign you should look for!</figcaption></figure>
<figure id="attachment_5050" style="width: 384px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014HKP3-08.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-5050" alt="2014HKP3-08" src="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014HKP3-08-768x1024.jpg?resize=384%2C512" width="384" height="512" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Here&#8217;s a shot of the entrance to let you know you&#8217;ve found the building. Much better than the other location right? Seems much more trustworthy.</figcaption></figure>
I was a bit out of breath by this point, but I was sure glad I had found the building within a reasonable time. And before I knew it I was riding the elevator up to the 12th floor.<br />
When the door opened, I was immediately greeted by a display case full of go memorabilia along with trophies and awards.<br />
<figure id="attachment_5051" style="width: 640px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014HKP3-09.jpg"><img class="size-large wp-image-5051" alt="2014HKP3-09" src="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014HKP3-09-1024x768.jpg?resize=640%2C480" width="640" height="480" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Stamps, signed fans, bowls, trophies etc. It was quite a sight!</figcaption></figure>
And after greeting the secretary at the front and exchanging the customary greeting and welcome, I turned left to see an incredible sight of go boards and bowls galore!<br />
<figure id="attachment_5052" style="width: 640px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014HKP3-11.jpg"><img class="size-large wp-image-5052" alt="2014HKP3-11" src="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014HKP3-11-1024x768.jpg?resize=640%2C480" width="640" height="480" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Isn&#8217;t this a magnificent sight? The only thing that would make it better would be people playing as well!</figcaption></figure>
Up on the left in the same room, there was a cork board where all the members had these mini tags with their names on it and hung by their respective rank.<br />
<figure id="attachment_5053" style="width: 640px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014HKP3-12.jpg"><img class="size-large wp-image-5053" alt="2014HKP3-12" src="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014HKP3-12-1024x768.jpg?resize=640%2C480" width="640" height="480" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Look at all those players! Each little tag is a person! If only I could have met and played one of them!</figcaption></figure>
In terms of my lesson that day, it turned out that I would be learning from the President of the Hong Kong Go Association himself! (I will refer to him as Shiu Lao Shi from this point on.)<br />
<figure id="attachment_5054" style="width: 640px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014HKP3-13.jpg"><img class="size-large wp-image-5054" alt="2014HKP3-13" src="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014HKP3-13-1024x768.jpg?resize=640%2C480" width="640" height="480" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">As you can see, my stuff is setup on the right table. This was where we had our lesson.</figcaption></figure>
For the first part of our lesson, we went over concepts regarding opening theory (i.e, fuseki). While this is a topic I have studied a bit overall (compared to other aspects of go), I was of course humbled by how Shiu Lao Shi was able to remind me of some fundamental principles when it came to fuseki.<br />
One of the key ideas I was taught was how the opening was a lot about balance. If you can get an even result, then you have done a good job with the fuseki. Too often players try to get some massive advantage and then end up in a bad position. This is still something I&#8217;m working on, but it was a much needed reminder since I&#8217;m an aggressive and impatient player as a whole.<br />
After more fuseki study, we played a 5-stone handicap game. Due to time constraints, I was not able to record the game. However, although I never got to spend the time I would have liked to try to recreate the full game, here is a partial kifu that I tried to recreate that day.*<br />
*Note: There is no commentary on this kifu due to how short it is, but I thought that being able to see how the game started up would be better than nothing.<br />

<p style="text-align: left;">After the lesson, I got to explore a little bit more and found their magnificent book collection.</p>
<figure id="attachment_5055" style="width: 640px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014HKP3-14.jpg"><img class="size-large wp-image-5055" alt="2014HKP3-14" src="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014HKP3-14-1024x768.jpg?resize=640%2C480" width="640" height="480" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Isn&#8217;t this massive? All Chinese books though! If only we had this many English go books&#8230;.</figcaption></figure>
Before I came to the HKGA, I had also envisioned that there might be a store or a pile of books where I could purchase something for me to remember the place by. Unfortunately all their books were on a loan basis only (which I would obviously not be doing since I&#8217;d never return it haha), and there was no &#8220;gift shop.&#8221; However, though I didn&#8217;t know it at the time, I was very lucky in that Shiu Lao Shi had no intentions of letting me leave empty handed.<br />
After walking around the HKGA a bit more and chatting with Shiu Lao Shi, I went up to the front desk to pay for the lesson. Next thing I know, Shiu Lao Shi was asking the secretary to give me a souvenir bag. The following are shots of the very generous gift that he ended up giving me.<br />

As you can imagine, I was very grateful and thanked him numerous times for such a generous gift. After all, I had expected to leave the HKGA with nothing but a good story and what I could carry in my brain. So I was like a little kid on Christmas when he gave me all of these souvenirs for me to bring home with me.<br />
<figure id="attachment_5068" style="width: 384px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014HKP3-27.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-5068" alt="2014HKP3-27" src="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014HKP3-27-810x1024.jpg?resize=384%2C485" width="384" height="485" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Here&#8217;s a shot of me and Shiu Lao Shi by the front desk.</figcaption></figure>
When the time came to part ways, we exchanged contact information and said our good-byes. I was certainly sad to leave since I would have loved to have stayed all day, but time was ticking and I had to go meet my family afterwards.<br />
Overall, I was glad that I was able to visit the HKGA and have a chance to learn from Shiu Lao Shi. It was a great experience and I certainly hope that I&#8217;ll be able to go back one day and play with other locals in the area. Maybe I&#8217;ll attend a tournament or something&#8230; you never know what the future holds&#8230; =)</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Conclusion</h2>
<p>With all that said and done, I hope that you enjoyed my Hong Kong series and felt that you could get a glimpse into my adventures in Hong Kong. As always, any feedback you have for me would be greatly appreciated. And if you ever have any questions or plan to go to Hong Kong yourself, please let me know and I&#8217;d be happy to chat with you!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 style="text-align: center;">Friday Go Forward: Week 56</h2>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>This week marked the start of April and thus the official countdown to <a title="US Go Congress Official Site" href="http://www.gocongress.org/">US Go Congress</a>! In addition, I am uber psyched to announce that I officially joined the <a title="Yunguseng Dojang Official Site" href="http://www.yunguseng.com/">Yunguseng Dojang</a> and will definitely be part of Season 9 2014! Even though it hasn&#8217;t started yet, since it&#8217;s a break month, I was able to get started on checking out some of the recorded material in there. And while I would love to rant on and on about it right now, I will keep it short and just say that there is a lot of great stuff waiting for me to discover.<br />
I think I have come up with a new training regimen for my training my tsumego and reading, but I haven&#8217;t finalized it yet so I&#8217;ll wait till next week to update the section with what I&#8217;m doing. And in terms of playing go, it has been a bit quieter this week, but I&#8217;m definitely hoping to get online and play a game soon! Hope you all are doing well and I&#8217;ll see you next week!</p>
<h2>Training Regimen</h2>
<ul>
<li><b>Reading Ability &#8211; </b>Work on the tasks below until whichever comes first.*
<ul>
<li>Work on go problems for 30 minutes.</li>
<li>Work on 300 go problems.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>*<em>This is a way to split the difference between task based versus time based training. If you work faster than normal, and can get through 300 (or whichever number you decide on) problems. Kudos to you. But in the event you&#8217;re having trouble and need more time to work on the problems, just keep at it until 30 minutes is up (or whatever time you think it best for you).</em></p>
<h2>Games</h2>
<ul>
<li><a title="KGS Website" href="http://www.gokgs.com/">KGS</a> &#8211;  2 games</li>
<li><a title="Dragon Go Server - BenGoZen's Profile" href="http://www.dragongoserver.net/userinfo.php?uid=60385">DGS</a> &#8211; 5 ongoing games</li>
<li><a title="Online Go Server - BenGoZen's Profile" href="http://online-go.com/user/view/549/BenGoZen">OGS</a> &#8211;  4 ongoing games</li>
</ul>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">The Featherweight Go Set</h2>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> &#8220;Weighing in at just 20.5 oz (580 g), the Featherweight Go Set is even lighter than your average travel Go set. But here&#8217;s the thing; it&#8217;s a proper, full sized Go board with stones. It includes size 21 plastic stones (0.3 inches or 8 mm thick) with a 0.8 inch (20 mm) diameter and a durable, full size, crease resistant 19&#215;19 plastic Go board. The board can easily be folded or rolled, making this set highly portable. Keep a set in your bag or briefcase so that you&#8217;re always ready for a serendipitous game of Go!&#8221; &#8211; GoGameGuru<br />

<strong>What&#8217;s the best aspect about this product?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Portability! It&#8217;s one of the lightest products I&#8217;ve encountered while still maintaining decent quality!</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What is the weakest aspect of this product?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>As someone who is used to using real stones, the stones can feel a bit lighter than desired; but to be honest, it beats not having any board or stones to play when you&#8217;re out and about!</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Is it durable?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The stones are plastic and should hold up well enough. The board is made of fabric so it shouldn&#8217;t tear so easily, but will probably wear out over time with use and will eventually need replacing.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Bottom Line</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Great lightweight go set for that one can easily pack without noticing any additional weight or bulkiness.</li>
<li>Recommended for any player looking to always have a go set on hand without the hassle or concern over the safety of a wooden board or real stones.</li>
</ol>

[expand title=&#8221;My Review&#8221; trigclass=&#8221;expandTitle&#8221; expanded=&#8221;true&#8221;]
True to their word, this featherweight go set came packed in a super light way with no bulky boxes!<br />
<figure id="attachment_4492" style="width: 360px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/01/featherweightgoset02.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-4492" alt="featherweightgoset02" src="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/01/featherweightgoset02.jpg?resize=360%2C270" width="360" height="270" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">As you can see, everything fits in one bag!</figcaption></figure>
<figure id="attachment_4493" style="width: 360px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/01/featherweightgoset03.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-4493" alt="featherweightgoset03" src="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/01/featherweightgoset03.jpg?resize=360%2C270" width="360" height="270" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Contents of the bag: two bags of stones and one board</figcaption></figure>
<figure id="attachment_4494" style="width: 360px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/01/featherweightgoset04.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-4494" alt="featherweightgoset04" src="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/01/featherweightgoset04.jpg?resize=360%2C270" width="360" height="270" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">The board unfolded</figcaption></figure>
The board is made of fabric and has a nice feel to it. It does have a little issue staying flat after being packaged and folded for so long, but a little patience and flattening helped to keep it pretty straight. And like the description says, it really does feel like a full size board when you spread it out over the table.<br />
<figure id="attachment_4495" style="width: 360px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/01/featherweightgoset05.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-4495" alt="featherweightgoset05" src="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/01/featherweightgoset05.jpg?resize=360%2C270" width="360" height="270" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Close-up of the stones</figcaption></figure>
As you can see for the stones, they are not simply plastic biconvex stones; but they also have a flat center on both sides in order to ease with the stone placement on the board. Though this is contrary to typical stone design, I think that this works out great for this set since the plastic stones are not very heavy to begin with. So as a result, the flat center really helps out.<br />
<figure id="attachment_4496" style="width: 360px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/01/featherweightgoset06.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-4496" alt="featherweightgoset06" src="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/01/featherweightgoset06.jpg?resize=360%2C270" width="360" height="270" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Entire set in action</figcaption></figure>
<figure id="attachment_4497" style="width: 360px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/01/featherweightgoset07.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-4497" alt="featherweightgoset07" src="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/01/featherweightgoset07.jpg?resize=360%2C270" width="360" height="270" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Close-up of the set in action</figcaption></figure>
As you can see, it&#8217;s a great set that really provides a wonderful experience when it&#8217;s impossible to carry around a wooden board and real stones. As someone who has used cheaper &#8220;featherweight&#8221; sets that were plastic boards and such, this is a huge improvement and is the one I recommend if you&#8217;re looking for your &#8220;featherweight go set.&#8221; Hope this helped!<br />

<strong>What&#8217;s the best aspect about this product?</strong></p>

<li>Gives a similar feeling of slate stones without the hefty price tag.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What is the weakest aspect of this product?</strong></p>

<li>Though this is to be expected of someone who started out using yunzi stones, I found them to be a little slippery at first. However, it didn&#8217;t take long before I acclimated to the stones and had no trouble using them.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Is it durable?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Based on my usage so far, I see no reason why they wouldn&#8217;t last a lifetime if used properly. Doesn&#8217;t seem like it would chip easily.</li>

<p><strong>Bottom Line</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Easy to clean and a pleasure to use.</li>
<li>If you like stones that are glossy and shine in the light, this is a great set for you.</li>
<li>For those who are not yet able to afford a set of slate and shell stones, this is a great set that gives a similar feel (i.e., smooth) and look (i.e., glossiness) without the hefty price tag.</li>

[expand title=&#8221;My Review&#8221; trigclass=&#8221;expandTitle&#8221; expanded=&#8221;true&#8221;]
In my go collection, I&#8217;ve owned my fair share of different types of stones: yunzi, slate and shell, and plastic. The funny thing is that glass stones have always been relatively inexpensive to some of the stones I have bought; but no longer, that ends with this set!<br />

<span style="line-height: 1.5em;">As someone who started out using yunzi stones, I was a bit surprised at how slippery it was when I first started using it. Stones would slip out of my fingers constantly. However, after a bit of patience and realizing I couldn&#8217;t grip them with the same force I normally gripped yunzi stones, it came a lot easier and they did not fall out nearly as often.</span><span style="line-height: 1.5em;"><br />
</span><br />
At the end of the day, this is a beautiful set that any player would be delighted to have if they are looking for stones with a glossy finish that shine in the light. Highly recommended and as always, let me know if you have any questions about the set!<br />

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Folding Wooden Go Board</h2>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Over­all Rat­ing: 8 / 10 Ponnuki</h2>
<h3>High­lights</h3>
<ul>
<li>Great portable board considering I got it for around $10.</li>
<li>The lines are not drawn the best, but it does the job and is worth the purchase.</li>
<li>Let me know if you find this anywhere online, since the local store doesn&#8217;t sell it anymore.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Prod­uct Details</h3>
<ul>
<li>One folding Go Board (19&#215;19).</li>
<li>Measures 18-1/4&#8243;L x 17&#8243;W x 3-3/4&#8243;H (46.5cm x 43cm x 9.7cm).</li>
<li>Board is 1-1/2&#8243; (4cm) thick.</li>
</ul>
<p><span id="more-76"></span></p>
<h3>Detailed Review</h3>
<p><strong>Size &amp; Weight:</strong> For it&#8217;s portability, the size actually is quite nice since it fits in my 14 inch laptop messenger bag. It&#8217;s light compared to any other table board you might buy.<br />
<strong>Dura­bil­ity:</strong> It holds up very well and very reliable in transit. I&#8217;ve carried it a number of times and never worried about dings or scratches that might ruin the board.<br />
<strong>Usabil­ity:</strong> The sound that the board makes from stones hitting it are not nearly as fulfilling as one might get from a shin-kaya board, but it really fits the bill when you&#8217;re looking for an easy to transport go board.<br />
Although the local store does not sell it anymore, this product is definitely worth buying if you ever see one. In fact, the moment anyone finds a place that sells it, be sure to let me know!</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Reversible &#8220;Rosewood&#8221; Go Board</h2>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Over­all Rat­ing: 2 / 10 Ponnuki</h2>
<h3>High­lights</h3>
<ul>
<li>If by rosewood they mean a cheap knock-off layer of &#8220;wanna-be&#8221; rosewood and then layered by cheap wood, then they accomplished their job.</li>
<li>Although the lines look semi-elegant in the product image, it ended up looking rather cheap and hard to see on the board.</li>
<li>DO NOT PURCHASE THIS BOARD!</li>
</ul>
<h3>Prod­uct Details (What They Claim)</h3>
<ul>
<li>One 48cm x 52cm x 3cm reversible board (19&#215;19 Go and Chinese Chess).</li>
<li>&#8220;Exquisite and unique Chinese chess board made of solid rosewood inlaid with wooden lines.&#8221;</li>
<li>Weight: 5kg.</li>
</ul>
<p><span id="more-18"></span></p>
<h3>Detailed Review</h3>
<p><strong>Size &amp; Weight:</strong> The board is standard size and nothing out of the ordinary. The weight however, is rather heavy and not great for portability.<br />
<strong>Dura­bil­ity: </strong>The board was damaged during transit. Now normally I would not blame the board, but when I saw the damage and how the top layer was peeling off and the construction was so poor; I just can&#8217;t imagine that this board is that reliable.<br />
<strong>Usabil­ity:</strong> You can play go stones on top of it, but otherwise, I would have hated using this board since the wood grain was irregular, ugly, and the lines on top were hard to see.<br />
If I were to hypothesize how they built this board, I imagine them taking a random slab of wood, put either cheap laminate material that looks like rosewood around the board, and then painted it with a Chinese Chess board on one side and a Go board on the other. The grain was not unified, and the design quality of the board (e.g. the paint that draws out the lines of the Go board and the stars) was terrible. In fact, I was so unhappy with the board that I couldn&#8217;t even bring myself to take pictures of its miserable quality and just wanted to get my money back as soon as possible.<br />
Bottom line:<strong> Do not buy this board</strong>. There is no link to purchase it, and I&#8217;m not even including the vendor I purchased it from for the sake of keeping one more person from making my mistake of purchasing it. And if you see other &#8220;rosewood&#8221; products with a similar claim to this one (e.g., reversible Chinese chess / go board), the products are most likely identical and I would stay far far away.</p>

[expand title=&#8221;Synopsis&#8221; trigclass=&#8221;expandTitle&#8221; ]
<strong>What did I enjoy about the book?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>There is a LOT of content for such a small book.</li>
<li>Covers nine concepts that are useful for more advanced players.</li>
<li>Has ten practice problems that are graded on a scale as opposed to simply right or wrong.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What did I gain from reading this book?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>As a beginner, I had a hard time grasping anything from the book.</li>
<li>As a more advanced player, I felt that I gained a better understanding of the opening. Though I will say that the boost in my confidence was only moderate.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What style of teaching does the book use?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Textbook Approach
<ul>
<li>Content is organized in a curriculum format and follows a lecture style of writing.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Primary Learning Mechanism:
<ul>
<li>Explanations with example diagrams</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Other Learning Mechanisms:
<ul>
<li>Practice problems</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What aspect can be improved on?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>I would have liked to see more problems in the book to allow the reader to practice what he/she learned.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Is this book easy to read?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>As a beginner, this was not an easy book to read. The material was rather dense and was difficult to understand. For players that are more advanced however, the book is written rather concisely and one will appreciate how much content is packed into such a small book.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Bottom Line</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>If you are a beginner, steer clear of this book. This is for more advanced players.</li>
<li>This book is more of a synopsis of the opening as opposed to a step by step guide to the opening.</li>
<li>People are interested in learning about the opening should check out <a title="Book Review: Opening Theory Made Easy" href="//book-review-opening-theory-made-easy/">Opening Theory Made Easy</a> first.</li>
</ol>
[/expand]
[expand title=&#8221;Before I Read This Book&#8230;&#8221; trigclass=&#8221;expandTitle&#8221;]
<strong>My Abilities</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>I was utterly brand new to the game when I first received this book.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>My Perspective</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>I was looking forward to reading about the beginning steps that beginners should take.</li>
</ul>
[/expand]
[expand title=&#8221;My Review&#8221; trigclass=&#8221;expandTitle&#8221; expanded=&#8221;true&#8221;]
When I first read this book, I was an 18 kyu eager to learn all he could about go. Unfor­tu­nately, this was the first book I encoun­tered and it was so dense I was nearly dis­cour­aged from learn­ing any­thing more about open­ing the­ory. The rea­son this book receives a low score on read­abil­ity is due to the notion that it is an “ele­men­tary” book. With the West­ern edu­ca­tion sys­tem, most of us would assume that it should be appro­pri­ate for newer play­ers. Noth­ing could be fur­ther from the truth.<br />
Its small size is decep­tively wel­com­ing, but the con­tent is incred­i­bly dense and cryp­tic for newer play­ers. This makes it near impos­si­ble to make any of the infor­ma­tion applic­a­ble to your games. So while you may be plant­ing seeds of wis­dom for a time when you will have an epiphany, it may be some time before you can see the fruits of your labor. After all, the last thing I want to see are peo­ple putting their pre­cious time and effort into a book that may not be as help­ful as they hoped. As a result, if you are a beginner, I highly rec­om­mend steer­ing clear of this book and start­ing with <a title="Book Review: Opening Theory Made Easy" href="//book-review-opening-theory-made-easy/">Open­ing The­ory Made Easy</a> if you really want to learn more about the opening.<br />
Now that my rant as a beginner is done, I want to turn the other side of the coin and emphasize the fact that this book has an incredible amount of information for such a small book. There are many nuggets of wis­dom in here for those who are able to actu­ally under­stand the book. In addi­tion, the last chap­ter con­sists of prob­lems that are quite use­ful in gain­ing a bet­ter under­stand­ing as to why some open­ing points are bet­ter than others.<br />
Finally, I also want to mention the fact that this book does NOT cover fuseki patterns (e.g., Chinese opening, ninren-sei, sanren-sei, etc.). It is simply focused on establishing basic principles and methods behinds the opening. Nothing more than that.<br />

<h2><em>Weekly Go Wednesday, Issue #3</em></h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Of all the go topics in the entire universe, this is by far the single most popular one. After all, getting one stone strong is the eternal pursuit of every go player. There are a plethora of articles out there on how to do so, but my goal is to provide the fastest route for you to progress as a go player (to SDK at the bare minimum).</p>
