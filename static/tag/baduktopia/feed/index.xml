[expand title=&#8221;Before I Read This Book&#8230;&#8221; trigclass=&#8221;expandTitle&#8221;]
Around this time, my reading skills and knowledge was around 4-5 kyu. I have had a lot of success with this series up to this point, so I was looking forward to what skills I would be training next.<br />
[/expand]
[expand title=&#8221;My Review&#8221; trigclass=&#8221;expandTitle&#8221; expanded=&#8221;true&#8221;]
In this volume of the Jump Level Up Series, you will find the usual sample openings and introduction of a couple joseki along with a heavy emphasis on training techniques in capture stones. Whether this is through eye space reduction, shortage of liberties, or ways to get ahead in capturing races, there is certainly a lot to be learned and trained in this book. Other sections that may be of interest to others include finding effective connections along with an introduction of some endgame techniques as well. There is a section on ko in here as well, but it is not very robust and one should not expect too much from it. Overall however, the book has continued to live up to my expectations for this series and I would highly recommend it!<br />
[/expand]
[expand title=&#8221;Synopsis&#8221; trigclass=&#8221;expandTitle&#8221;]
<strong>What did I enjoy about the book?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Lots of training on capturing techniques.</li>
<li>It forces you to really get comfortable with capturing races.</li>
<li>Continues to provide the format and quality of content you come to expect from the series.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What did I gain from reading this book?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Improved ability to identify ways to get ahead in capturing races.</li>
<li>Some new endgame techniques that I have started to look for in my actual games.</li>
<li>Improved overall reading ability.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What is the format of the book?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The book is primarily structured as follows: (1) A one page explanation of the topic that you are about to practice. Example: When behind in liberties. They not only show the sequence for the proper technique, but also include common mistakes and brief explanations as to why they are mistakes. (2) A set of very easy to understand and follow practice problems to ensure you understand what you are learning.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What aspect can be improved on?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>On two occasions, a problem that is beyond the scope of what I was practicing popped up. Problems #23 and #24 on Page 151. This was rather left-field and threw me off quite a bit. I would recommend against these sort of problems since it can be discouraging to those without an answer book.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Is this book easy to read?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Yes. It doesn&#8217;t get much more simple or straightforward than this.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Bottom Line</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Continues to live to the high expectations I have for this series.</li>
<li>An incredible way for players to immerse themselves and gain the ability to actually apply the concepts they are learning to their own games.</li>
<li>Worth the money!</li>
</ol>
[/expand]
[expand title=&#8221;Recommended For&#8230;&#8221; trigclass=&#8221;expandTitle&#8221;]
<ul>
<li>Though the series is designed for kids, both kids and adults alike will be able to learn everything they need to know about playing go in a fun and entertaining way.</li>
<li>People who enjoy learning things in an easy to understand format and lots of opportunities to reinforce what they are learning.</li>

<strong>What did I enjoy about the book?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>I like the fact that there is a section on how to blockade stones. Novel practice problems.</li>
<li>Reviews old joseki patterns and continues to teach new ones.</li>
<li>Started introducing endgame technique in regards to simple but effective tesuji that players often overlook.</li>
<li>Gives proper attention to the concepts of connections between stones.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What did I gain from reading this book?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Improved fundamentals in endgame techniques.</li>
<li>More familiarity with haengma (e.g., stone movement) regarding diving, blockading, and connections.</li>
<li>Reinforcement on my semeai (e.g., capturing races) skills.</li>
<li>Reinforcement of my understanding of tesuji such as jachung (e.g., shortage of liberties) and clamps.</li>

(2) A set of very easy to understand and follow practice problems to ensure you understand what you are learning.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What aspect can be improved on?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>When learning about endgame techniques, there were a couple of problems where I had to figure it out for myself when solving it. In other words, there was no prior explanation that focused on that specific techniques (e.g., snapback). To be clear though, this occurred like in 1% of the problems, so it&#8217;s not a big issue at all; but it&#8217;s something I thought I would note.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Is this book easy to read?</strong></p>

<li>Yes. It doesn&#8217;t get much more simple or straightforward than this.</li>

[expand title=&#8221;My Review&#8221; trigclass=&#8221;expandTitle&#8221; expanded=&#8221;true&#8221;]
When I first heard that there was an intermediate level of the Level Up Series, you can only imagine how ecstatic I was. And though part of me thought that it would suddenly be a lot more advanced, I am really pleased with how the transition is actually hardly noticeable.<br />
As usual with this series, I really love how I am just forced to practice concepts to the point where I am quite sick of it. The reason for this is that when you first learn a concept, it takes a bit of efforts in order to apply the concept. However, with their study method, I am now incredibly more comfortable at spotting out things such as jachung (e.g., shortage of liberties).<br />
And another thing I&#8217;ll note with about the Jump Level Up series, they still take no chances in letting fundamental skills such as falsifying eyes get even the slightest bit rusty. Though it might seem like you are repeating something &#8220;so simple,&#8221; I really appreciate that they do this since I still found myself answering some of the problems incorrectly (which clearly goes to show that my foundational skills are not quite flawless yet).<br />

<strong>My Abilities</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>I have been exposed to a fair number of joseki by this point, but I was far from being able to understand why they were played the way they were. In addition, figuring out how to punish josekis was a whole level above my head as well.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>My Perspective</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>While I might have become familiar with a few joseki here and there, I was realy hoping to start from the ground up and get a much better how joseki are created and built.</li>
</ul>
[/expand]
[expand title=&#8221;Synopsis&#8221;  trigclass=&#8221;expandTitle&#8221;]
<strong>What did I enjoy about the book?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The way they teach joseki is SO easy to understand!</li>
<li>They take their time explaining why certain moves are mistakes.</li>
<li>There are many opportunities for reinforcement on picking the right move.</li>
<li>They have you evaluate the first 30-40 moves of a game and have you figure out which move was a mistake.</li>
<li>They teach joseki that takes into consider other stone positions such as a star side point that is occupied.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What did I gain from reading this book?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A much better understanding of why joseki sequences are what they are.</li>
<li>A significant boost in my comfort with joseki as a whole.</li>
<li>Higher confidence in my ability to &#8220;create joseki&#8221; rather than &#8220;memorize joseki.&#8221;</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What is the format of the book?</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>A brief introduction on why one should study joseki along with some advice for how to study joseki.</li>
<li>A brief review on the proper way to extend.</li>
<li>All chapters on joseki then following the format below:
<ol>
<li>Basic overview of the sequence for the joseki with accompanying one line explanations for each move.</li>
<li>A page or two on how to deal with mistakes and why the mistakes are good or bad for the respective player.</li>
<li>Practice problems for how to respond to different situations. This includes mistakes along with proper moves.</li>
<li>One to two problems where you have to evaluation a kifu (approximately 10-30 moves long) and determine which player played better and which move was the mistake.</li>
<li>One to two sample professional openings that usually contain the joseki that the reader just learned.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>What aspect can be improved on?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>There are some useful proverbs that are placed on the bottom of the page (e.g., &#8220;Even a moron connects against a peep.&#8221;), but they can be rather cryptic at times. This is possibly due to the fact they were translated from Korean, but they&#8217;re not as helpful as I was hoping. Although to be clear, this is not the focus of the book, so it&#8217;s not a big deal.</li>
<li>They need to make more of these books! More more more!</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Is this book easy to read?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Yes. It doesn&#8217;t get much simpler than this.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Bottom Line</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>This is how joseki should have been taught from day one!</li>
<li>An incredible way to be introduced to joseki as a whole.</li>
<li>Serves as a fantastic companion to the rest of the Level Up Series.</li>
</ol>

[expand title=&#8221;My Review&#8221; trigclass=&#8221;expandTitle&#8221; expanded=&#8221;true&#8221;]
One of the reasons I have always avoided the study of joseki is that most of the literature out there is EXTREMELY dense when you consider that a large portion of players interested in joseki are kyu players. In addition, I personally feel that kyu players encounter far more star point joseki in their games due to the nature of being a kyu player. In addition, star point joseki have far fewer variations and much easier to undrestand.<br />
This is seriously an incredible milestone for go literature. In all honesty, this is the book that everyone should use when they want to start learning about joseki. And in fact, this is the way that all joseki should be taught from the get go. There are so many opportunities for reinforcement. For example, I am completely in love with the new problem format they introduce: analyzing a kifu and determining not only who played better, but which move was the mistake as well! INCREDIBLE!<br />
[/expand]
[expand title=&#8221;Recommended For&#8230;&#8221; trigclass=&#8221;expandTitle&#8221;]
<ul>
<li>Players who want an easy to understand introduction to creating joseki (as opposed to memorizing them).</li>
<li>Players who want opportunities to practice the sequence through problems instead of waiting till the off-chance it occurs in their games.</li>
</ul>

<strong>My Abilities</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A mid to high SDK (single digit kyu) kyu who has read his fair share of go books and has a pretty strong foundation in the basics and teaching go.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>My Perspective</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>I started making more errors in Level Up 9, but it definitely taught me some things about my instinctual reading abilities. So I&#8217;m looking forward to what the final installment has in store for me!.</li>
</ul>
[/expand]
[expand title=&#8221;My Review&#8221; trigclass=&#8221;expandTitle&#8221; expanded=&#8221;true&#8221;]
<strong>What did I enjoy about the book?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>I like how they correct basic misconceptions (that are rampant even in SDK games I&#8217;ve watched) like trying to block on the second line by hane early in the game.</li>
<li>I really like they show possible mistakes in joseki and teaches the reader how to handle them.</li>
<li>Introduces the reader to different techniques in winning capturing races.</li>
<li>Already starts to get the player to start being wary of trick plays, albeit not vey complicated ones.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What did I gain from reading this book?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A better understanding of the reason behind certain moves in joseki.</li>
<li>Firmer grasp of fundamental principles behind haengma (i.e. movement of the stones).</li>
<li>Greater comfort with capturing races and some of the techniques behind winning them.</li>
<li>Polished my reading abilities.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What style of teaching does the book use?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Curriculum Style
<ul>
<li>Content is organized into lessons, topics, or themes in order to facilitate learning.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Primary Learning Mechanism:
<ul>
<li>Practice problems</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Other Learning Mechanisms:
<ul>
<li>Cute and entertaining comics to teach and/or reinforce lessons.</li>
<li>Simple explantations that are accompanied by equally simple diagrams.</li>
<li>Samples of openings from professional games to further acclimate the reader to full games on a 19&#215;19 board.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What aspect can be improved on?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Page 95 Problem 6 has no solution aka impossible to solve.</li>
<li>On a rare occassion, the directions don&#8217;t quite match up to the problem (e.g., P.163 #4).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Is this book easy to read?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Yes. Other than the occasional article, the explanations are very easy short and easy to understand.</li>
</ul>
[/expand]
[expand title=&#8221;Recommended For&#8230;&#8221; trigclass=&#8221;expandTitle&#8221;]

<li>People who enjoy learning things in an easy to understand format and lots of opportunities to reinforce what they are learning.</li>

<li>I also really liked the fact that they subtly show proper use of the &#8220;empty triangle.&#8221;</li>
<li>Once again, they do a great job with life and death by training even the most basic skills like &#8220;Making a Living 4-Point Eye Shape.&#8221; It might seem easy, but unless it&#8217;s second nature, players might actually miss it in their actual games.</li>

<ol>
<li>Really solid review of the content that was taught in the first five volumes of the Level Up Series.</li>
<li>In place of explanations, there are a lot more problems and opening samples.</li>
<li>If you want a review of the basics; but feel buying five introductory books is a little excessive, this is a nice all in one.</li>

<ul>
<li>A mid to high SDK (single digit kyu) kyu who has read his fair share of go books and has a pretty strong foundation in the basics and teaching go.</li>

[expand title=&#8221;My Review&#8221; trigclass=&#8221;expandTitle&#8221; expanded=&#8221;true&#8221;]
<strong>What did I enjoy about the book?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Some review books are jokes in terms of comprehensive review, this is not one of them.</li>
<li>They spare no effort drilling concepts and making sure you remember what you learned over the last 5 books.</li>
<li>Even it is easy overall, a stronger player should not be overconfident in determining the answers. I almost made a few mistakes as a result of it.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What did I gain from reading this book?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Polished my fundamental life and death skills.</li>
<li>Improved my ability to read out capturing races.</li>
<li>Gained a better instinct when analyzing the board and what to play next.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What style of teaching does the book use?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Drill Sergeant
<ul>
<li>Practice&#8230; practice&#8230; practice&#8230;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Primary Learning Mechanism:
<ul>
<li>Practice problems</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Other Learning Mechanisms:
<ul>
<li>Samples of openings from professional games to further acclimate the reader to full games on a 19&#215;19 board.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What aspect(s) can be improved on?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>No complaints here. The book was extremely thorough and very accurate. Did not find any discrepancies in the answer book this time around.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Is this book easy to read?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Yes. Unless you can&#8217;t read English, it doesn&#8217;t get much simpler.</li>
</ul>
[/expand]
[expand title=&#8221;Recommended For&#8230;&#8221; trigclass=&#8221;expandTitle&#8221;]
<ul>

[expand title=&#8221;My Review&#8221; trigclass=&#8221;expandTitle&#8221; expanded=&#8221;true&#8221;]
<strong>What did I enjoy about the book?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>It introduces the reader to the concept of good and bad shapes.</li>
<li>Starts training the reader to practice looking for important stones.</li>
<li>They do a great job introducing seki and offer lots of really simple but effective practice problems for it.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What did I gain from reading this book?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Polished my ability to distinguish between key stones in capturing races.</li>
<li>Started rebuilding my ability to see seki positions from the ground up.</li>
<li>Polished my abilities to use nets, shortage of liberties, ladders, and snapback.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What style of teaching does the book use?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Curriculum Style
<ul>
<li>Content is organized into lessons, topics, or themes in order to facilitate learning.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Primary Learning Mechanism:
<ul>
<li>Practice problems</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Other Learning Mechanisms:
<ul>
<li>Cute and entertaining comics to teach and/or reinforce lessons.</li>

</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What aspect(s) can be improved on?</strong></p>

<li>No complaints here. I was really happy with the progression of problems in this book.</li>
<li>Errata &#8211; Question #3 on page 51 &#8211; Black&#8217;s shape seems incorrect. The stones should form a solid triangle instead of the hanging connection.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Is this book easy to read?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Yes. It was very easy to understand all the explanations and progress through the book.</li>
