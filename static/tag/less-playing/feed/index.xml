				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>It seems I&#8217;m on a trend of not playing as many games anymore, but I&#8217;m okay with that for now since I&#8217;m currently in a big study mode. I have over 100+ books in my collection (and that&#8217;s physical books mind you) and I have barely made a dent. In addition, I have another plan to immerse myself in studying Korean style go books. It will involve buying lots of new books and changing my regimen, but before I do that I want to finish all the Kiseido series that I have started. So, be on the lookout for lots more book reviews!</p>
<h2>Games</h2>
<ul>
<li><span style="line-height: 13px;">KGS &#8211; 3 games (2 wins : 1 loss)</span></li>
<li>DGS &#8211; 2 ongoing games</li>
<li>Nova &#8211; 2 ongoing games</li>
</ul>
<h2>Training</h2>
<ul>
<li><span style="line-height: 13px;">Worked on <em>Essential Life &amp; Death,</em><em> Vol. 2 </em>everyday.</span></li>
<li>Worked a little bit on <em>Attacking and Defending Moyos</em>.</li>
<li>Worked through <em>Modern Master Games, Vol. 1</em>.</li>
<li>Finished <em>Positional Judgment</em>.</li>
<li>Started and finished <em>The Direction of Play</em>.</li>
<li>Started <i>Elementary Go Series &#8211; Tesuji.</i></li>
</ul>
<h2>Lessons Learned</h2>
<ol>
<li>I am not vigilant when it comes to reading out sequences properly.</li>
<li>I still play &#8220;wishful go&#8221; and think that my opponents will respond to things that I myself would never respond to.</li>
<li>To help remedy my problem of playing moves without thinking, I&#8217;m trying to take one deep breath before each move to try and slow down.</li>
</ol>
