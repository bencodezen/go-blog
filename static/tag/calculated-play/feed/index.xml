				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Over the last few days, something that has been bothering me is the fact that my rank graph has completely plateaued. While I know that I can match stronger opponents in even games sometimes, it was bothering me that I did not have the rank to show for it.<br />
After some thought though, I have realized that my anxiety at letting KGS define my strength is rather stupid. First of all, I just don&#8217;t have enough time to play the ranked games required to possibly show whatever improvements that I may have gained. On top of that, it&#8217;s not as if KGS&#8217; ranking equation is the best in the world. So with that in mind, what am I worried about?<br />
In addition, I&#8217;ve also come to terms that my style has always been more of a wild fighting style. It&#8217;s not that I was never interested in the calculated wins where the win margin was 10 points or less; but my style always led to games that would be decided by 30 points or more. In fact, I think I continued playing that way in order to avoid actually counting since the advantage would be so clear there would be no need to count.<br />
And so, regardless of the fact that I may be a KGS 5k for some time, I have decided to play all of my opponents with my weakest style from now on: calm and calculated. (Don&#8217;t get me wrong. If the opponent offers an opportunity for me to strike, I will unleash a tornado of fury upon them.) I will lose a lot, but I have a feeling that this is my biggest obstacle before I leave the world of kyus.<br />
Watch out shodans. I&#8217;ll be knocking at your door before you know it.</p>
