<p style="text-align: center;"><em>In case this isn&#8217;t apparent, this is a 2-D drawing. And also, do you spot what I see? xD</em></p>
<p>Late last night, I had written about the fact that my go has become a race to the finish line. I realize that I was probably not the most articulate since I was about to pass out, but upon further reflection this morning, I realized that my problem actually is rooted in the fact that I have lost sight of my zen (aka my center of calm).<br />
Whenever I play a move, I realized that I am always in a hurry to see what my opponent plays next. In fact, it&#8217;s almost as if I&#8217;m trying to play a blitz game in a game that&#8217;s supposed to have a main time of 20 minutes or more. As a result, autopilot moves show up and failure to consider global effects arise again and again.<br />
Bottom line: I need find my center again. Otherwise, this will quickly spiral out of control and my go will become a reckless monster beyond saving. This ends today.</p>
