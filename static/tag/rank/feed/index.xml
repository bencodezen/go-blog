In every player&#8217;s journey, there comes a point in every player&#8217;s growth where their opponent&#8217;s rank begins to impact how they approach each game. To clarify, I&#8217;m not simply referring to overplays in handicap games as opposed to calm and balanced moves in even games. Like many of my other thoughts on players&#8217; growth in go, today&#8217;s topic deals with the impact their opponent&#8217;s rank has on them.<br />
<span id="more-1645"></span><br />
Let&#8217;s start by simplifying the types of categories into three simple categories.</p>
<ol>
<li>Games against stronger opponents.</li>
<li>Games against weaker opponents.</li>
<li>Games against opponents of equal strength.</li>
</ol>
<p>Everyone has different reactions and mentalities towards each type of game. For the sake of simplifying our analysis though, the two we are particularly interested in is people&#8217;s mindset against stronger and weaker opponents.<br />
When playing against stronger players, most players feel a need to be defensive and be extra cautious. This is rather natural since it is assumed that the stronger player should be able to see things that the weaker opponent cannot. However, one often forgets that a myriad of skills contribute to each player&#8217;s rank. While each player&#8217;s reading ability determines a minimum baseline for their rank (i.e., it is impossible for a 10 kyu to read at a 30 kyu level), other concepts like global strategy and positional judgment make a big difference as well. As a result, it is sad when players end up playing defensively against an imaginary tesuji that only existed in their minds because their opponent&#8217;s rank was higher.<br />
On the flip side, whether it is handicapped or even games, playing against weaker players often brings about a desire to prove one&#8217;s superiority in terms of rank and skill. While we often forget that the handicap system was established in order to allow players of different strengths to play an equally competitive game for both sides, the fact that the opponent&#8217;s rank is lower causes players to (either subconsciously or consciously) look down at their opponent. This is a particularly fatal mindset since it causes overconfidence and cockiness that is will often lead to their own demise. In addition, as much as go is a competitive sport, looking down at an opponent is in bad taste.<br />
Now granted, there are always exceptions to the rule, and there are times where playing against stronger players can even bring about a better playing style. However, because there are already so many variables that contribute to how strong a player is, <strong>it is in your best interest to start ignoring your opponent&#8217;s rank when playing a game</strong>. Once the appropriate settings (e.g., handicap stones) have been set, <strong>the goal is simply about finding the best move and exploiting your opponent&#8217;s inefficient / overplay moves</strong>. If you maintain this simple goal, it will be irrelevant whether you are playing a stronger player or weaker player, because you can be sure that you will be playing every move to the best of your ability instead of based on your opponent abilities.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 style="text-align: center;"><em>Weekly Go Wednesday, Issue #9</em></h2>
<p><a href="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2012/11/rank.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1173" title="Rank" src="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2012/11/rank-300x300.jpg?resize=300%2C300" alt="Rank Image Credit to Adam Howell" width="300" height="300" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><br />
For those who have never played in a in-person tournament before, the idea of a &#8220;real life rank&#8221; may seem foreign. I assure you, however, that this is something you&#8217;ll want to give some thought to before you enter your first tournament.<br />
As most of us know, a majority of go players have gained their strength through online play. As a result, common sense would dictate that their rank online would be what their rank should be when they enter a tournament. While some may disagree with me, personal experience has taught me that this is not the case for the following reasons:<br />
<strong>#1. Your online rank is generally a representation of you on your best days.</strong><br />
Yes. I realize that your rank includes your losing streaks and bad days as well. Ultimately however, people play go online when they feel like playing. It&#8217;s a voluntary choice and they can voluntarily choose to stop if they feel that they are having a bad day. Tournament play is completely different in this regard. Unless you plan on leaving early, you are going to have to play every round regardless whether you&#8217;re feeling off or not.<br />
<strong>#2. Online ranks are inflated.</strong><br />
Think about it for a moment. How many times have you played games where opponents resigned after the first fifty moves because they lost a group? In fact, I would say that a large number of ranked games online are won by resignation. This means that there are many times where the game may have been reversed if the opponent was willing to try harder and finish the game in its entirety.<br />
<strong>#3. Tournament games and online ranked games are on completely different levels.</strong><br />
Two reasons: attitude and stamina.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">A. Your opponents will be on a completely different level than before they are here to stay. They are here for the long haul and want to have the best record possible, so don&#8217;t even think for a moment that you can just kill a group and get an early resignation. In other words, every victory you have will be a proof of &#8220;winning a won game&#8221; or &#8220;reversing a lost game.&#8221; There will be no easy victory.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">B. Unless you happen to be one of those players who plays games that are on average of 45 minutes long and multiple games in a row, I would honestly question your ability to handle multiple rounds where both players will most likely be using all of their time and then some. On top of that, you will need to be able to play multiple rounds of this intensity regardless of whether you&#8217;re having a good or bad day.</p>
<p>While Sensei&#8217;s Library has a table (which can be found <a title="Sensei's Library - Rank Worldwide Comparison" href="http://senseis.xmp.net/?RankWorldwideComparison">here</a>) that seems to argue that AGA ranking and KGS ranking are identical, I have found that you are generally one stone weaker than your KGS rank in AGA tournaments. The only exception to this rule however, is for seasoned tournament veterans who are accustomed to the environment and have consistent play regardless of whether it is online or tournament. Most of the time however, I believe most players will fall into the first category.<br />
As a final word of caution, do not forget that the combination of the pressure of the tournament, the need to actually keep track of your time, and the unknown true strengths of your opponents make for an intense battleground. It would be wise not to be to think too highly of yourself.</p>
