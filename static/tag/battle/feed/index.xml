For Game 3 of the epic <a title="Gu Li and Lee Sedol Jubango" href="//gu-li-lee-sedol-jubango/">jubango</a> between Lee Sedol (9P) and Gu Li (9P), we have arrived at a crucial point. Lee Sedol is already 2-0 (<a title="WGW 31: Gu Li vs Lee Sedol — Jubango Game 1 Amateur Review" href="//wgw-31-gu-li-vs-lee-sedol-jubango-game-1-amateur-review/">Game 1</a> and <a title="WGW 33: Gu Li vs Lee Sedol — Jubango Game 2 Amateur Review" href="//wgw-33-gu-li-vs-lee-sedol-jubango-game-2-amateur-review/">Game 2</a>) and there is concern that the jubango will end earlier than desired. After all, everyone wants to see all 10 games. However, the rules of the jubango is that the first to six victories win. As a result, for this game, even Lee Sedol fans were rooting for Gu Li to turn the tide so that we could see more games.<br />
For those who don&#8217;t keep up with the professional scene, Gu Li had managed to beat Lee Sedol in two other tournament matches prior to this game, so even though there was concern that there would be too much pressure on Gu Li, people had high hopes that Gu Li would be able to make a comeback this game.<br />
As with the previous reviews (<a title="WGW 31: Gu Li vs Lee Sedol — Jubango Game 1 Amateur Review" href="//wgw-31-gu-li-vs-lee-sedol-jubango-game-1-amateur-review/">Game 1</a> and <a title="WGW 33: Gu Li vs Lee Sedol — Jubango Game 2 Amateur Review" href="//wgw-33-gu-li-vs-lee-sedol-jubango-game-2-amateur-review/">Game 2</a>), this review continues to be geared towards kyu players who struggle with the advanced analysis and discussion that normally occurs between dan and professional level players. There is commentary for every move so that hopefully you won&#8217;t ever feel lost. In addition, I am happy to announce that frozensoul (5d) has joined forces with me again for this game review. Many thanks goes out to him for providing a number of the insights you&#8217;ll see throughout the review.<br />
Just like before, please let me know if you notice anything or have any suggestions that I can do to improve the review. I look forward to getting your feedback on this game review. Hope you enjoy it and learn a thing or two through it!<br />

As some of you know, Gu Li and Lee Sedol recently had their second game in their <a title="Gu Li and Lee Sedol Jubango" href="//gu-li-lee-sedol-jubango/">jubango</a>. And because the feedback on <a title="WGW 31: Gu Li vs Lee Sedol — Jubango Game 1 Amateur Review" href="//wgw-31-gu-li-vs-lee-sedol-jubango-game-1-amateur-review/">my review of Gu Li and Lee Sedol&#8217;s first jubango game</a> was positive, I am happy to announce that I will continue reviewing every game from this jubango! Before we get into the review itself though, there are a couple of things I wanted to mention.</p>
<ol>
<li>In response to your feedback from <a title="WGW 31: Gu Li vs Lee Sedol — Jubango Game 1 Amateur Review" href="//wgw-31-gu-li-vs-lee-sedol-jubango-game-1-amateur-review/">my review of Gu Li and Lee Sedol&#8217;s first jubango game</a>, this review was created to include more of my reactions and thoughts on the game as opposed to simply trying to &#8220;teach people what&#8217;s going on.&#8221;</li>
<li>However, I do want to emphasize that I still believe firmly in providing a thorough breakdown of the game in order to allow players of all strengths to be able to follow the game and gain more enjoyment from it. So continuing with the same format as before, there is commentary for every single move regardless of how &#8220;obvious&#8221; it might seem.</li>
<li>Though frozensoul and I were able to combine forces on the first game, I was unable to get together with him in time for me to release this post. So this game review is solely my doing and therefore all ideas and analyses come from the best I have in my SDK brain. Hopefully in the future I&#8217;ll be able to collaborate with him and/or other stronger players as well.</li>
<li><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">For more advanced reviews, be sure to keep an eye out on </span><a style="line-height: 1.5em;" title="World Go Online Review of Jubango Game 1" href="http://www.kiseido.com/printss/guliten1.html">World Go Online</a><span style="line-height: 1.5em;"> and </span><a style="line-height: 1.5em;" title="GoGameGuru Review of Jubango Game 2" href="http://gogameguru.com/lee-sedol-races-ahead-2-0-gu-li-vs-lee-sedol-jubango/">GoGameGuru</a><span style="line-height: 1.5em;"> since I&#8217;m sure they will have their own in the near future.</span></li>
</ol>
<p>I hope that you enjoy the review and improved format. Be sure to leave comments as the format is still a work in progress and I am always trying to make the reading experience a more enjoyable one for you!<a href="//wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Gu-Li-vs-Lee-Sedol-20140223.sgf"><br />

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Update: There is a correction to the score I reported in the kifu. Due to Chinese counting, the final score was actually a half point win for Lee Sedol. Though it didn&#8217;t change the result of the game, it definitely only adds to the epicness and excitement of the game!</strong></p>

<figure id="attachment_4650" style="width: 392px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Lee-Sedol-jubango-game-1.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-4650 " alt="Credit to GoGameGuru" src="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Lee-Sedol-jubango-game-1.jpg?resize=392%2C263" width="392" height="263" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Credit to <a href="http://gogameguru.com/lee-sedol-gets-flying-start-gu-li-vs-lee-sedol-jubango/">GoGameGuru</a></figcaption></figure>
For those who didn&#8217;t know, Gu Li and Lee Sedol had their first epic match of their <a title="Gu Li and Lee Sedol Jubango" href="//gu-li-lee-sedol-jubango/">ten match series jubango</a>. And though many of you might have watched the game or checked out the game record later on, I wouldn&#8217;t be surprised if a number of weaker players like myself were left in bewilderment most of the time. After all, even though it was really exciting, it&#8217;s hard to learn from a game where so much is going on at once!<br />
So I came up with the idea to team up with my sensei, frozensoul, and do a review together in order to provide a step-by-step review of every move in the game. Now granted, I&#8217;m sure that many strong dan players might refute some of my comments or argue that there is so much more to what I reviewed, but my goal is simply this: <strong>To provide a game record that would allow kyu players to easily follow the game and understand some of the most significant moments of the game.</strong> As a result, it should be no surprise that complicated variations and advanced theoretical discussions are intentionally avoided and left to other people who are much more qualified to speak to those things than I am (i.e., <a title="World Go Online Review of Jubango Game 1" href="http://www.kiseido.com/printss/guliten1.html">World Go Online</a> and <a title="GoGameGuru Review of Jubango Game 1" href="http://gogameguru.com/go-commentary-lee-sedol-vs-gu-li-jubango-game-1/">GoGameGuru</a>). The following is the result of our efforts:<br />

<p style="text-align: left;">Finally, I would love to do this for every game in the jubango series. However, it took a LOT of time and effort in order to do so. As a result, I am hoping to get feedback from everyone on whether or not you think the review was helpful / was it worth it in order to help me decide whether to continue doing this or not. And as usual, if you like what I have done but have ideas for making it even better, please be sure to mention that in the comments below (or <a title="Contact" href="//contact/">email me</a> if you&#8217;re feeling shy =D). Looking forward to reading all of your comments!</p>
