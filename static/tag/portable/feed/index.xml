<h2 style="text-align: center;">The Featherweight Go Set</h2>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> &#8220;Weighing in at just 20.5 oz (580 g), the Featherweight Go Set is even lighter than your average travel Go set. But here&#8217;s the thing; it&#8217;s a proper, full sized Go board with stones. It includes size 21 plastic stones (0.3 inches or 8 mm thick) with a 0.8 inch (20 mm) diameter and a durable, full size, crease resistant 19&#215;19 plastic Go board. The board can easily be folded or rolled, making this set highly portable. Keep a set in your bag or briefcase so that you&#8217;re always ready for a serendipitous game of Go!&#8221; &#8211; GoGameGuru<br />

<strong>What&#8217;s the best aspect about this product?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Portability! It&#8217;s one of the lightest products I&#8217;ve encountered while still maintaining decent quality!</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What is the weakest aspect of this product?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>As someone who is used to using real stones, the stones can feel a bit lighter than desired; but to be honest, it beats not having any board or stones to play when you&#8217;re out and about!</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Is it durable?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The stones are plastic and should hold up well enough. The board is made of fabric so it shouldn&#8217;t tear so easily, but will probably wear out over time with use and will eventually need replacing.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Bottom Line</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Great lightweight go set for that one can easily pack without noticing any additional weight or bulkiness.</li>
<li>Recommended for any player looking to always have a go set on hand without the hassle or concern over the safety of a wooden board or real stones.</li>
</ol>

[expand title=&#8221;My Review&#8221; trigclass=&#8221;expandTitle&#8221; expanded=&#8221;true&#8221;]
True to their word, this featherweight go set came packed in a super light way with no bulky boxes!<br />
<figure id="attachment_4492" style="width: 360px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/01/featherweightgoset02.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-4492" alt="featherweightgoset02" src="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/01/featherweightgoset02.jpg?resize=360%2C270" width="360" height="270" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">As you can see, everything fits in one bag!</figcaption></figure>
<figure id="attachment_4493" style="width: 360px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/01/featherweightgoset03.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-4493" alt="featherweightgoset03" src="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/01/featherweightgoset03.jpg?resize=360%2C270" width="360" height="270" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Contents of the bag: two bags of stones and one board</figcaption></figure>
<figure id="attachment_4494" style="width: 360px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/01/featherweightgoset04.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-4494" alt="featherweightgoset04" src="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/01/featherweightgoset04.jpg?resize=360%2C270" width="360" height="270" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">The board unfolded</figcaption></figure>
The board is made of fabric and has a nice feel to it. It does have a little issue staying flat after being packaged and folded for so long, but a little patience and flattening helped to keep it pretty straight. And like the description says, it really does feel like a full size board when you spread it out over the table.<br />
<figure id="attachment_4495" style="width: 360px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/01/featherweightgoset05.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-4495" alt="featherweightgoset05" src="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/01/featherweightgoset05.jpg?resize=360%2C270" width="360" height="270" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Close-up of the stones</figcaption></figure>
As you can see for the stones, they are not simply plastic biconvex stones; but they also have a flat center on both sides in order to ease with the stone placement on the board. Though this is contrary to typical stone design, I think that this works out great for this set since the plastic stones are not very heavy to begin with. So as a result, the flat center really helps out.<br />
<figure id="attachment_4496" style="width: 360px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/01/featherweightgoset06.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-4496" alt="featherweightgoset06" src="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/01/featherweightgoset06.jpg?resize=360%2C270" width="360" height="270" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Entire set in action</figcaption></figure>
<figure id="attachment_4497" style="width: 360px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/01/featherweightgoset07.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-4497" alt="featherweightgoset07" src="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/01/featherweightgoset07.jpg?resize=360%2C270" width="360" height="270" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Close-up of the set in action</figcaption></figure>
As you can see, it&#8217;s a great set that really provides a wonderful experience when it&#8217;s impossible to carry around a wooden board and real stones. As someone who has used cheaper &#8220;featherweight&#8221; sets that were plastic boards and such, this is a huge improvement and is the one I recommend if you&#8217;re looking for your &#8220;featherweight go set.&#8221; Hope this helped!<br />

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Folding Go Board</h2>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> When it comes to go on the go (yes that just happened), this folding go board from GoGameGuru really does seem to hit the sweet spot between portability, quality, and price. It utilizes a hinge mechanism to keep the go board in one piece and even has a Chinese chess board on the reverse side! Recommended stone size are 21 or 22. It fits other stones, but it&#8217;s a bit snug. Highly recommended!<br />

<strong>What&#8217;s the best aspect about this product?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A legitimate portable wooden board that looks great when using it!</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What is one aspect this product could improve on?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>This is expected and in the product description, but I can&#8217;t help but wish that the board could accommodate all sizes of stones. Granted, that would make the board larger; but it&#8217;s just a small thing that would be nice. =D</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Is it durable?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>So far so good! The laminate does seem like it could dent if you dropped something heavy on it, but it seems to hold up just fine with regular use (aka placing stones on the board). The wood also seems quite solid, but I would refrain from dropping it.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Bottom Line</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>An incredible portable board that looks great when you&#8217;re using it.</li>
<li>Fits like a dream in my backpack and delivers on portability.</li>
<li>The best portable board I&#8217;ve seen on the market so far. Highly recommended!</li>

[expand title=&#8221;What I Was Hoping For&#8221; trigclass=&#8221;expandTitle&#8221;]
For those who have been following me since the beginning, I&#8217;m sure you remembered that I bought <a title="Equipment Review: Folding Wooden Go Board" href="//equipment-review-folding-wooden-go-board/">one</a> quite some time ago. During my hiatus of go, it transferred ownership to my good friend Nate. So naturally, with me being back in go full force, it was inevitable that I would need to find a replacement. And though I have seen one or two online, the shipping has always been rather ridiculous or the board wasn&#8217;t quite what I was looking for. So when I found out about this product, I couldn&#8217;t order it fast enough!<br />

<p style="text-align: left;">As you can see in the pictures above, the board comes in a well designed box that looked quite professional. If they could translate the text into English, I could totally see this product being primed for being sold in Western stores (since some people just get weirded out by languages they don&#8217;t understand). Some of the go products I&#8217;ve seen sold in book stores and such seem a bit shoddy and could really use a make-over.</p>

This was a pleasant surprise for me when I unfolded it. I used to play Chinese chess when I was a kid and so I was pretty psyched when I found out that this portable board could also double as a Chinese chess board. Score! But for the those who have no interest in this side, you can take comfort in that the hinges are exposed on this side so that it does not interfere with the go side of the board.<br />
<figure id="attachment_4338" style="width: 320px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2013/11/foldinggoban10.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-4338" alt="foldinggoban10" src="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2013/11/foldinggoban10.jpg?resize=320%2C240" width="320" height="240" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Folding go board in action with size 36 glass stones!</figcaption></figure>

<figure id="attachment_4340" style="width: 320px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2013/11/foldinggoban12.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-4340" alt="foldinggoban12" src="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2013/11/foldinggoban12.jpg?resize=320%2C240" width="320" height="240" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Folding go board in action with size 36 glass stones (close-up #2)</figcaption></figure>
As you can see from the photos of the board in action, the size 36 stones fit rather snugly on the board and can feel a bit cluttered. So though it does fit, it would make for a more enjoyable experience to use size 21/22 stones as recommended. As a result, it&#8217;s no surprise that I will would recommend the <a title="Equipment Review: The Go Bento Box" href="//equipment-review-go-bento-box/">Go Bento Box</a> as this board&#8217;s traveling companion.<br />
At the end of the day, this board really does a remarkable job of providing portability, great value, and a very pleasing aesthetic look for an incredible price. Definitely well worth every penny. So if you&#8217;re in the market for a folding go board, be sure to add this one to your cart!</p>

<p><strong>Description:</strong> The &#8220;Go Game Set Bento Box&#8221; this is perhaps the first product I&#8217;ve seen that aims to provide players with a portable set of go stones that are not cheap plastic stones. Not only do they pack away very well and are easy to carry, but the stones are also a respectable size and material that should delight any go player who wants a portable set of stones!<br />

[expand title=&#8221;What I Was Hoping For&#8221; trigclass=&#8221;expandTitle&#8221;]
As someone who has bought his fair share of portable go sets, the one thing I always felt was lacking was the feeling of real stones. The magnetic go sets always came with plastic stones that did the job when you had nothing else, but left me wishing I had real stones each time. And I had tried bringing my actual go stones and bowls out to coffee shops, but they were rather cumbersome and awkward to carry. In addition, I was always worried I would damage them in transit since I would be carrying them in a backpack.<br />
So when I discovered this set, I was thrilled at the idea that I might get to bring a go set with legitimate stones wherever I went. I had never owned glass/ceramic stones that were size 22 before, but I was certainly hoping that they would do the trick whenever I was on the go and in need of a go set.<br />
[/expand]
[expand title=&#8221;My Review&#8221; trigclass=&#8221;expandTitle&#8221; expanded=&#8221;true&#8221;]
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2013/11/gobentobox02.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-4308" alt="gobentobox02" src="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2013/11/gobentobox02.jpg?resize=320%2C240" width="320" height="240" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>Since it&#8217;s been awhile since I reviewed equipment last, we start with the product in all its glory! Once you take it out of the box, you have the following:<br />
<figure id="attachment_4310" style="width: 320px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2013/11/gobentobox03.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-4310 " alt="gobentobox03" src="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2013/11/gobentobox03.jpg?resize=320%2C240" width="320" height="240" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">The product prior to opening the lid. (For those noticing the yellow tint, it is from the lid of the product and not lighting issues).</figcaption></figure>
As you can see, this is a set of glass Go stones, plastic bowls and a plastic Go board that pack away snugly, just like a lunch box! Very portable and very easy to hold in one had. The only downside I will say to this design however is that it does seem to lack some sort of strapping mechanism to prevent the lid from coming off in a backpack. A rubber band will do the trick, but I do wish there was something that came with the product.<br />
<figure id="attachment_4311" style="width: 320px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2013/11/gobentobox04.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-4311" alt="gobentobox04" src="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2013/11/gobentobox04.jpg?resize=320%2C240" width="320" height="240" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Bento box without the lid.</figcaption></figure>
As you can clearly see here, the 160 stones of each color fit quite comfortably in each box and do not show any signs of spilling out of the box. In addition, for those who are concerned with the fact that the set is less than the standard 361 stone set, keep in mind that most go games are less than 300 moves. So though it might seem like &#8220;less,&#8221; this set will actually be more than adequate 99% of the time.<br />
<figure id="attachment_4312" style="width: 320px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2013/11/gobentobox05.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-4312" alt="gobentobox05" src="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2013/11/gobentobox05.jpg?resize=320%2C240" width="320" height="240" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Side angle shot of bowls and stones to show that there is a nice depth to them that reminds you of a bowl.</figcaption></figure>
One of the things I disliked about other portable sets was the lack of dipping my hand into a bowl to grab a stone. Either the plastic bowls were way too shallow, or the stones were in a bag which did not really replicate the feeling very well. So even though this is a portable set, there is still enough depth to provide the &#8220;bowl-like&#8221; feeling (which was very much appreciated).<br />
<figure id="attachment_4313" style="width: 320px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2013/11/gobentobox06.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-4313" alt="gobentobox06" src="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2013/11/gobentobox06.jpg?resize=320%2C426" width="320" height="426" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">The primary contents of the go bento box (2 lids, 2 bowls and the respective stones).</figcaption></figure>
As you can see above, the primary components of this set are the 2 bowls to hold the stones, the lids, and the stones themselves. Something that people might overlook, however, is that the lids actually have another function besides providing the &#8220;bento box&#8221; shape.<br />
<figure id="attachment_4322" style="width: 320px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2013/11/gobentobox07.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-4322 " alt="gobentobox07" src="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2013/11/gobentobox07.jpg?resize=320%2C240" width="320" height="240" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">The lids double as ways to hold your captured stones when you&#8217;re on the go! They&#8217;re even color coordinated! How clever!</figcaption></figure>
The stones were overall in great condition. Unfortunately, I did receive a couple of chipped stones. There was only one that had a major chip (which was unusable) and one with a minor chip, but otherwise it was okay.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2013/11/gobentobox08.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-4317" alt="gobentobox08" src="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2013/11/gobentobox08.jpg?resize=320%2C240" width="320" height="240" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>Besides the chipped stones, the stones seem to hold up rather well. They aren&#8217;t exactly top-notch material and might damage over a long period of time, but that is only fair when you consider that you are only paying around $25 for this set.<br />
<figure id="attachment_4318" style="width: 320px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2013/11/gobentobox09.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-4318" alt="gobentobox09" src="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2013/11/gobentobox09.jpg?resize=320%2C240" width="320" height="240" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">The stones in action on my folding go board at a coffee shop!</figcaption></figure>
When it came time to using them, I have to say that they were a delight to use. Although they are not as thick as the stones that one might normally use at a go club or at home, the size and weight of the stones are more than adequate when it comes to providing that feeling of picking up and placing the go stone on the board. And as you can see in the picture above, they fit quite nicely on my <a title="Equipment Review: Folding Go Board" href="//equipment-review-folding-go-board/">folding go board</a> and look great!<br />
So at the end of the day, I have to say that <a href="http://shop.gogameguru.com/go-bento-box/?acc=e4da3b7fbbce2345d7772b0674a318d5">The Go Bento Box</a> from GoGameGuru is a great product that provides incredible value for those interested in obtaining a portable set that keeps the essence of real stones without the hefty weight and bulky items. I wouldn&#8217;t necessarily recommend it as your primary set of stones that you use at home, but when it comes to needing a set of stones on the go, this product fits the job description! Highly recommended!<br />
<em>Note: The new Go Bento Box also includes a durable, full size, crease resistant 19&#215;19 plastic Go board. Unfortunately, when I purchased this set it did not come with one; but since most of you will probably be purchasing this for the stones, I hope that you don&#8217;t mind!</em><br />

<h3>Detailed Review</h3>
<p><strong>Size &amp; Weight:</strong> The entire set is as light as a feather and easily fits in practically any bag (except possibly purses).  To further clarify, unless you have cargo pants that have massive pockets, this is not a set you can carry around with you in your pocket. And in all honesty, who wants to play on a board that is pocket size. Can you imagine how small the stones would be?!<br />
<strong>Dura­bil­ity:</strong> The entire set is made of plastic that should survive any normal wear and tear. Now granted, if a child decides to throw a tantrum and stomp all over it, I am pretty sure that your board will be demolished. In terms of the stones, you are far more likely to lose the stones before they ever break or crack. In addition, the magnetic board is adhered pretty well to the plastic; but any decent use of force will allow you to pull it off, so be careful.<br />
<strong>Usabil­ity:</strong> The overall design of the set is done well and quite pleasant to use. Due to the cost of the board however, it is to be expected that the stones are sometimes a little oddly shaped or cut slightly off. This doesn&#8217;t detract from the general usage, but can be a little aesthetically irritating to some people.<br />
Even though the set might come with a couple ill-shaped pieces with missing magnets, the value and quality of the board outmatches the price that you pay for it. Sure, there are many ways to improve the quality of the board; but I wouldn&#8217;t hold my breath for a portable go set with the quality and value of a true wood / stone go set. The purpose of this set is for recreational play during travel as opposed to serious play during tournament, so be sure to have the right expectations when you order this set.</p>

<h3>Detailed Review</h3>
<p><strong>Size &amp; Weight:</strong> For it&#8217;s portability, the size actually is quite nice since it fits in my 14 inch laptop messenger bag. It&#8217;s light compared to any other table board you might buy.<br />
<strong>Dura­bil­ity:</strong> It holds up very well and very reliable in transit. I&#8217;ve carried it a number of times and never worried about dings or scratches that might ruin the board.<br />
<strong>Usabil­ity:</strong> The sound that the board makes from stones hitting it are not nearly as fulfilling as one might get from a shin-kaya board, but it really fits the bill when you&#8217;re looking for an easy to transport go board.<br />
Although the local store does not sell it anymore, this product is definitely worth buying if you ever see one. In fact, the moment anyone finds a place that sells it, be sure to let me know!</p>

<h3>Detailed Review</h3>
<p><strong>Size &amp; Weight:</strong> Absolutely perfect. It&#8217;s small enough that it could fit in a backpack if you needed to. So unlike a real board and stones, it&#8217;s very easy to store away and doesn&#8217;t take up very much space. And in regards to the weight, it has enough weight to feel solid; but otherwise it&#8217;s super light and easy to carry.<br />
<strong>Dura­bil­ity:</strong> I&#8217;ve had this product for more than a year now and words cannot express how appreciate I am to have a product that holds up so well. The case is still great condition, and the stone bags have a little wear and tear but nothing major. In addition, the stones and board show some signs of use; but they are still working magnificently.<br />
<strong>Usabil­ity:</strong> Absolutely no complaints. The board flattens out with relative ease, and the stones* cling to the board rather well. (In one of the shots below, you&#8217;ll see that I have the board upside down and nothing falls off). In addition, putting everything back in the case is actually really easy. Since the bags that are carrying the stones are made with fabric, they conform to the shape of the case with a relative ease when you shake it a bit. And if you&#8217;re wondering about how the strap works in terms of slinging it over your back, it works fantastic.<br />
Considering how much this costs, this is honestly one of the best value items that exists on the entire go market. I could go on about how awesome this product is, but bottom line: unless you want a portable set made of actual stones and wood, this is hands down the best portable go set out there.<br />
<em>*Some people say that the stones are &#8220;too small,&#8221; but let&#8217;s be fair people, this is a portable set. If you want full sized stones, go and lug your stones and bowls. </em></p>
