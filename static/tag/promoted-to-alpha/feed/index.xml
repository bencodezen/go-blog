<h2>Thoughts</h2>
<p>Overall, it&#8217;s been a rather eventful week since the ASR League was wrapping up and the final points were being tallied. The good news is that I managed to get promoted to Alpha!!! Woot woot! I know that some people will say, &#8220;It&#8217;s easy to get to Alpha. Just play a lot of games.&#8221; To you I say that may be true if you actually win some of your games, but otherwise it&#8217;s near impossible since your points rack up so slowly compared to people who win a majority of their games.<br />
Since February is going to be a short month, it seems I will be going on another ranked game sabbatical since I will have my hands full trying to stay in Alpha class and also keeping up with my study schedule for the month. Not to mention that <a title="North American Go Convention!!!" href="//north-american-go-convention/">North American Go Convention</a>Â is this month as well, and that will take out four days of studying/playing. So lots to do this month, and very little time. Something&#8217;s got to give right? =) Here&#8217;s to the start of a crazy month! Ikuzo!</p>
