<h2>Thoughts</h2>
<p>Although I haven&#8217;t played as much as I might have liked, this week has been pretty interesting in terms of the various activities I&#8217;ve had going on. My go studying has taken on more flavors and variety, which has greatly increased my enjoyment of what I&#8217;m learning. In addition, it feels as if I&#8217;m starting to think less and less of winning, which is something I hope to ingrain permanently into my being. There are a number of reasons due to this spark of an epiphany. One that I will mention in particular is from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fighting_Spirit_(manga)">Hajime no Ippo</a>.<br />
The line comes from a scene after the main character, Ippo, manages to win against a boxer who&#8217;s goal was to become like his idol. When analyzing what happened and why Ippo won (even though he was an underdog), the idol said:</p>
<blockquote><p>It was the result of different goals between the challengers. Those who try to reach and those who try to surpass.</p></blockquote>
<p>Although I&#8217;ve heard similar lines to this before, it was rather profound to me when I read it (perhaps due to the emotional attachment to characters and the story). And to be honest, I think there&#8217;s a lot of truth in there. Because in actuality, my goal is not to simply reach shodan; but to surpass it entirely.</p>
