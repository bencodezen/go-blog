				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Over the last couple months, one of the things I&#8217;ve been really wrestling with is my aversion to handicap games: regardless of which side I was on. I can&#8217;t really pinpoint the reason for this fear of playing handicap games, but it was leading me down a path where I was starting to avoid playing handicap games all together.<br />
There&#8217;s a quote that my brother has on his phone: &#8220;Life begins where your comfort zone ends.&#8221; Although I was not thinking of go when he first showed it to me, it recently dawned upon me that &#8220;getting stronger in go begins where your comfort zone ends.&#8221;<br />

At that moment, any negative emotions I had about handicap go was instead replaced by excitement for the possibilities that lay beyond the world of handicap go. It&#8217;s not such much that I want to become an expert in handicap go, but there is so much to be learned through playing it that it could mean wonders for my growth. Oh the possibilities&#8230;</p>
