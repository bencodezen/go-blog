<h2>Thoughts</h2>
<p>I am having a rough week. Besides a nice solid win, it&#8217;s been nothing been getting demolished. I feel that my reading is improving a bit, but overall I think my go has sunk to a 10k level. I&#8217;m not sure where my head is anymore. It&#8217;s not so much that I&#8217;m on tilt and just losing strings of games, but it&#8217;s more like I&#8217;m getting numb and have completely lost my focus. An absolutely terrible state to be in for go.<br />
After some discussion with frozen, I also think it&#8217;s best that I forgo my ASR League duties for the month. I still plan on playing one of my classmates twice before dropping (you know who you are =D), but otherwise I think it&#8217;s time that I spent my time elsewhere to prevent me from taking a break from go. I&#8217;ve seem to hit a rather large roadblock that is rather daunting at the moment. =(<br />
It&#8217;s definitely been a tough week, but I will confront my demons and try to continue moving forward. After all, it is precisely these moments that we are given an opportunity to prove our resilience and capacity to grow to the next level. Here&#8217;s to the uphill battle that I&#8217;m about to embark on. Wish me luck.</p>
