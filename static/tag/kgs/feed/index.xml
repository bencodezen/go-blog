				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;ve been feeling rather off the last couple of days. Not sick or anything, but just feeling a little out of it. Haven&#8217;t really felt like studying, but it&#8217;s been fun playing a casual game here and there. But on a more important note, I just discovered a site called <a href="http://kgsbash.org/">KGSBash</a>. And if you&#8217;re wondering what it&#8217;s about, here are some that had me laughing&#8230;<br />
<em><a href="http://kgsbash.org/?54"><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">#54</span></b></a> </em><br />
<em>adoreme: it is said that kgs has a secret end stage</em><br />
<em>adoreme: get 9dan</em><br />
<em>adoreme: and beat 50 9dans in a row</em><br />
<em>adoreme: then tartrate will appear as the endboss</em><br />
<em><a href="http://kgsbash.org/?49"><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">#49</span></b></a>  </em><br />
<em>RayFrost [2k]: I played a 3p today&#8230; with 9 handicap</em><br />
<em>RayFrost [2k]: I lost.</em><br />
<em>RayFrost [2k]: 3p is strong. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11/72x72/1f610.png" alt="😐" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></em><br />
<em>LazyDragon [3k]: i once played a 5p with 9hc &#8211; also lost &#8230;</em><br />
<em>tellone [2k]: i once played a very drunk 2p who forgot which collor he had</em><br />
<em>tellone [2k]: and i still lost</em><br />
Oh KGS&#8230; Good times&#8230;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So ironically my friend Todd happens to have been using the screenname &#8220;zenix&#8221; for like all his life.  Now mind you&#8230; I pronounce mine &#8220;zeh-nix&#8221; while he pronounces his &#8220;zee-nix.&#8221;  Anyhow, although the odds are like a bajillion to one (and those who know the statistics feel free to correct me) that we made the same screenname, I just thought it&#8217;d be better if I took the highroad and made a bengozen account anyhow since this is the brand I&#8217;m trying to blog with.  With that in mind, I&#8217;ll probably be getting the KGS Plus soon, and will be reviewing that as soon as I make some use of it.</p>
