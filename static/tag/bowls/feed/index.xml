<h3>Detailed Review*</h3>
<p>When purchasing my first go set, this was by far the most anticipated piece of equipment. After all, the prospect of playing with real stones and making the aesthetic sound as you play each move was so exciting! However, I digress, here is what the package looked like when it came in. As with all other items I&#8217;ve received from <a href="http://www.ymimports.com/">Yellow Mountain Imports</a>, everything was packaged and protected very well.<br />
<figure id="attachment_2351" style="width: 300px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2010/09/yunziset.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2351" alt="Top layer of styrofoam (not in picture)" src="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2010/09/yunziset.jpg?resize=300%2C225" width="300" height="225" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Top layer of styrofoam (not in picture)</figcaption></figure>
When you open the bag, here&#8217;s what you see.<br />
<a href="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2010/09/yunziset03.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2353" alt="yunziset03" src="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2010/09/yunziset03.jpg?resize=300%2C225" width="300" height="225" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><br />
<a href="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2010/09/yunziset04.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2354" alt="yunziset04" src="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2010/09/yunziset04.jpg?resize=300%2C225" width="300" height="225" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><br />
For those who are have never purchased yunzi before, they do not come all fresh and shiny when you receive them. The stones come with a white powder coat in order to protect from damage during shipment.<br />

<figure id="attachment_2356" style="width: 300px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2010/09/biconvex33yunzi02.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2356" alt="Yunzi Stones After Cleaning" src="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2010/09/biconvex33yunzi02.jpg?resize=300%2C225" width="300" height="225" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Yunzi Stones After Cleaning</figcaption></figure>
Although it requires a bit of elbow grease and time to get them shined up and ready to go, I personally found the process very enjoyable and rewarding. It&#8217;s hard to say what it is exactly, but there&#8217;s just something about personally taking care of your stones that makes your stones that much more enjoyable to use. For those who are curious as to what the process is for cleaning yunzi stones, visit <a title="How to Oil Your Yunzi Stones" href="//how-to-oil-your-yunzi-stones/">my guide</a> for more information.<br />
<strong>Size &amp; Weight:</strong> The stones have a solid weight to them that gives a great feeling when picking each one up and placing it on the board. They fit very well on the Shin-Kaya Board that I purchased, but keep in mind that each  board is unique in what their max stone size is.<br />
<strong>Durability:</strong> I have not found durability to be an issue. Granted, I have not tried taking a sledgehammer to them, but I think it could survive anything short of that.<br />
<strong>Usability:</strong> This set is a fantastic all in one package. Great for leaving at home or bringing with you to the local coffee shop.<br />
If you&#8217;re in the market for biconvex stones, this is the set for you.** The bag carries the stones pretty well. The bowls are freaking awesome. And I love the feel of real stones in my hands. Though the price may seem a little high, you are buying a quality set that has so much value and will last a long time.<br />
*<em>Since most people are probably more interested in the stones, I have separated out the bowls and bag review to prevent the review from being overcluttered. You can find the reviews at the following links: <a title="Equipment Review: Kitani Jujube Bowls" href="//equipment-review-kitani-jujube-bowls/">Kitani Jujube Bowls</a> &amp; <a title="Equipment Review: Go Stones and Bowls Carrying Bag" href="//equipment-review-go-stones-and-bowls-carrying-bag/">Go Stones and Bowls Carrying Bag</a>.</em><br />

<h2 style="text-align: center;"> Kitani Style Jujube Bowls</h2>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Overall Rating: 10 / 10 Ponnuki</h2>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">Highlights</h3>
<ul>
<li><span style="line-height: 13px;">This is my favorite style of bowls for holding go stones since they remind me of the ones on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hikaru_no_Go">Hikaru No Go</a>.</span></li>
<li>They have a nice finish to them that makes them very beautiful to look at.</li>
<li>Since the lid is also made of wood without any rubber coating, do not expect the lid to stay securely shut in the event the bowls tip over.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Product Details</h3>
<ul>
<li>Two Kitani style jujube wood Yunzi stone holders that measure 5&#8243; W x 4&#8243; H (12.7cm x 10cm)</li>
</ul>
<p><span id="more-2358"></span></p>
<h3>Detailed Review</h3>
<p>These bowls are from the Shin-Kaya Go Board Set. They come with a small square of yellow silk-like material that I believe is to cushion the bottom of the bowl for when you put your stones inside. Although it&#8217;s a rather small accessory, I think it adds a nice finishing touch to the bowls.<br />
<strong>Size &amp; Weight:</strong> The bowls on their own are rather light and can be held using one hand with relative ease.<br />
<strong>Durability:</strong> In the two years that I&#8217;ve owned these bowls, it has proven to be extremely durable and does not scratch very easily. Although I&#8217;m not expert on wood, they feel like high quality wood that will last for a very long time.<br />
<strong>Usability:</strong> Since the entire bowl is made of wood, the only caveat is that the lids do not stay on securely. So if the bowls get tipped upside down during transit, you can definitely expect the lid to slide off and stones to come out. Otherwise, the bowls function as you expect and look fantastic.<br />
Now of course, the opinion as to which style of bowl looks better is entirely subjective and varies between each person; but if you&#8217;re looking for kitani bowls made with quality wood, look no further.</p>
