				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As of late, I have been finding it difficult to really get my head in the game. I&#8217;m not sure if it&#8217;s due to the busy schedule of having relatives from out of town, or whether my mind is undergoing some new twists and turns that is changing the way I see the game.<br />
For those who have been keeping up with my progress, you probably remember that I mentioned a recently gained ability to estimate territory. Unfortunately though, it seems like my mind is once again becoming adverse to doing it and it&#8217;s causing me to just play moves on a local scale (which is turning out terribly might I add). And as if that wasn&#8217;t bad enough, I&#8217;ve gotten into a bad habit of not fully reading moves out before I play. This is ends up causing a vicious cycle of where I end up playing regrettable moves because of laziness as opposed to not seeing a particular sequence.  Oy vey&#8230;<br />
To counter these bad habits, I&#8217;m going back to the basics and doing life and death problems the old fashioned way: Read it till you figure it out. No more exposure to new material. Just a good ol&#8217; fashioned tsumego drills. In addition, I&#8217;ve started Cho Chikun&#8217;s book on <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Positional Judgment</span> to hopefully get myself more comfortable with evaluating the whole board. We&#8217;ll see how it goes&#8230;<br />
<em>Also, for those who enjoy game commentaries, you should definitely check out my long time friend and rival&#8217;s new <a href="http://nateeagle.com/2013/06/10/workshop-game-against-a-new-little-brother/">post</a> on a game he played recently at <a href="http://zhouyuan.com/">Yuan Zhou</a>&#8216;s Workshop! It is a fun exciting game that shows an excellent command of play by Black and numerous examples of how overplays are supposed to be punished. Definitely worth checking out!</em></p>
