[expand title=&#8221;Synopsis&#8221; trigclass=&#8221;expandTitle&#8221;]
<strong>What&#8217;s the best aspect about this product?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Light-weight and super affordable!</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What is the weakest aspect of this product?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Upon close inspection, the lines are not as clean as you&#8217;ll see on more expensive boards; but it still does the job well!</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Is it durable?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>After handling it, I see no reason why it won&#8217;t hold up to normal usage. However, if somewhere were to try and karate chop this board, I&#8217;m pretty sure it&#8217;d break. xD</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Bottom Line</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>A great go board for someone on a budget!</li>
<li>And in the event you know how to play Chinese chess, there&#8217;s a board of that on the back as well!</li>
<li>Definitely recommended over paper and/or plastic boards that exist out there!</li>
</ol>

[expand title=&#8221;My Review&#8221; trigclass=&#8221;expandTitle&#8221; expanded=&#8221;true&#8221;]
Here&#8217;s the front of the board at a slanted angle. It&#8217;s a nice yellow color to give it a semi-shin-kaya feel. (I prefer the yellow color over brown since it shows more contrast when stones are placed on the board; but that&#8217;s just a personal preference.)</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/01/dirtcheapgoboard02.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-4544" alt="dirtcheapgoboard02" src="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/01/dirtcheapgoboard02.jpg?resize=360%2C270" width="360" height="270" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">And here below, you can see that there&#8217;s a Chinese chess board on the back!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/01/dirtcheapgoboard03.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-4545" alt="dirtcheapgoboard03" src="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/01/dirtcheapgoboard03.jpg?resize=360%2C270" width="360" height="270" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Upon closer inspection, you&#8217;ll see that the lines are not perfectly straight the way you&#8217;ll see on higher quality boards. However, I wouldn&#8217;t let this be a deterrent from purchasing the board if it&#8217;s being used for casual play.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/01/dirtcheapgoboard04.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-4546" alt="dirtcheapgoboard04" src="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/01/dirtcheapgoboard04.jpg?resize=360%2C270" width="360" height="270" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Here are a couple of shots with the board in action with my size 36 glass stones. As you can see, the lines are not so obvious from a player&#8217;s perspective.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/01/dirtcheapgoboard05.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-4547" alt="dirtcheapgoboard05" src="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/01/dirtcheapgoboard05.jpg?resize=360%2C270" width="360" height="270" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/01/dirtcheapgoboard06.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-4548" alt="dirtcheapgoboard06" src="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/01/dirtcheapgoboard06.jpg?resize=360%2C270" width="360" height="270" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/01/dirtcheapgoboard07.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-4549" alt="dirtcheapgoboard07" src="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/01/dirtcheapgoboard07.jpg?resize=360%2C270" width="360" height="270" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Bottom line: I highly recommend this board for people who are looking to purchase boards for their club or for tournaments. This board would also function well as a casual study/playing board. However, I would definitely not recommend this as a primary goban for anyone who is looking for that classic air and sound you get from true wooden boards. So remember, the key thing to remember is that this is a board that focuses on affordability and practicality.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For those who haven&#8217;t heard the news, I am super excited to inform you about <a href="http://gogameguru.com/new-affordable-go-equipment/">GoGameGuru&#8217;s announcement on introducing new and affordable go equipment</a>!! As an avid go enthusiast who is constantly checking local stores and online retailers for go equipment, it is really exciting to see GoGameGuru fill a niche of go equipment that I think is desperately lacking right now. Here are the featured products that are coming to GoGameGuru:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2013/10/ggg-new-products.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-4241" alt="ggg new products" src="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2013/10/ggg-new-products.jpg?resize=561%2C436" width="561" height="436" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<ol>
<li><a href="http://shop.gogameguru.com/folding-go-board/">Foldable Go Board</a> &#8211; At $25 for a very beautiful looking foldable go board, this is probably the product I&#8217;m most excited about since I have been unsuccessful in locating a nice quality foldable go board for me to bring with me wherever I go.</li>
<li><a href="http://shop.gogameguru.com/dirt-cheap-go-set/">Dirt Cheap Go Set</a> &#8211; It&#8217;s currently on sale for $9.99, but even it&#8217;s regular price of $14.99 is an ABSOLUTE STEAL when it comes to the fact you are getting a full size plastic go board along with stones and bowls! It doesn&#8217;t get much better than this if you are looking to start your own go club and want to have enough equipment without breaking the bank.</li>
<li><a href="http://shop.gogameguru.com/plastic-biconvex-stones-go-set/">Featherweight Go Set</a> &#8211; This is on sale for $19.99 (regular price $25.00) and seems to be an upgraded version of the <a href="http://shop.gogameguru.com/dirt-cheap-go-set/">Dirt Cheap Go Set</a>. Looks pretty sweet based on the pictures!</li>
<li><a href="http://shop.gogameguru.com/go-stones/">Go Stone Sample Packs</a> &#8211; Priced around $10 each, they also offer you a chance to purchase a sample pack of stones for you to check out before choosing to finally invest in the full set! And if you&#8217;re wondering why this is so cool, the sample packs are primarily slate and shell stones. xD</li>
</ol>
<p>With that said and done, I want to inform all of you that I will be purchasing all of these products and will be reviewing them as soon as I get them. So you can expect to see some changes coming to the Equipment Review section in preparation for these awesome products.</p>
