[expand title=&#8221;Before I Read This Book&#8230;&#8221; trigclass=&#8221;expandTitle&#8221;]
<strong>My Abilities</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>My reading skills and knowledge would probably equate to a solid 5 kyu at this point.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>My Perspective</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>After finishing the Level Up Series, I was really looking forward to what the intermediate level would have to offer.</li>
</ul>
[/expand]
[expand title=&#8221;Synopsis&#8221; trigclass=&#8221;expandTitle&#8221;]
<strong>What did I enjoy about the book?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>I like the fact that there is a section on how to blockade stones. Novel practice problems.</li>
<li>Reviews old joseki patterns and continues to teach new ones.</li>
<li>Started introducing endgame technique in regards to simple but effective tesuji that players often overlook.</li>
<li>Gives proper attention to the concepts of connections between stones.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What did I gain from reading this book?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Improved fundamentals in endgame techniques.</li>
<li>More familiarity with haengma (e.g., stone movement) regarding diving, blockading, and connections.</li>
<li>Reinforcement on my semeai (e.g., capturing races) skills.</li>
<li>Reinforcement of my understanding of tesuji such as jachung (e.g., shortage of liberties) and clamps.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What is the format of the book?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The book is primarily structured as follows: (1) A one page explanation of the topic that you are about to practice. Example: When behind in liberties. They not only show the sequence for the proper technique, but also include common mistakes and brief explanations as to why they are mistakes. (2) A set of very easy to understand and follow practice problems to ensure you understand what you are learning.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What aspect can be improved on?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>When learning about endgame techniques, there were a couple of problems where I had to figure it out for myself when solving it. In other words, there was no prior explanation that focused on that specific techniques (e.g., snapback). To be clear though, this occurred like in 1% of the problems, so it&#8217;s not a big issue at all; but it&#8217;s something I thought I would note.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Is this book easy to read?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Yes. It doesn&#8217;t get much more simple or straightforward than this.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Bottom Line</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Continues to live to the high expectations I have for this series.</li>
<li>An incredible way for players to immerse themselves and gain the ability to actually apply the concepts they are learning to their own games.</li>
<li>Worth every penny!</li>
</ol>

[expand title=&#8221;My Review&#8221; trigclass=&#8221;expandTitle&#8221; expanded=&#8221;true&#8221;]
When I first heard that there was an intermediate level of the Level Up Series, you can only imagine how ecstatic I was. And though part of me thought that it would suddenly be a lot more advanced, I am really pleased with how the transition is actually hardly noticeable.<br />
As usual with this series, I really love how I am just forced to practice concepts to the point where I am quite sick of it. The reason for this is that when you first learn a concept, it takes a bit of efforts in order to apply the concept. However, with their study method, I am now incredibly more comfortable at spotting out things such as jachung (e.g., shortage of liberties).<br />
And another thing I&#8217;ll note with about the Jump Level Up series, they still take no chances in letting fundamental skills such as falsifying eyes get even the slightest bit rusty. Though it might seem like you are repeating something &#8220;so simple,&#8221; I really appreciate that they do this since I still found myself answering some of the problems incorrectly (which clearly goes to show that my foundational skills are not quite flawless yet).<br />
[/expand]
[expand title=&#8221;Recommended For&#8230;&#8221; trigclass=&#8221;expandTitle&#8221;]
<ul>
<li>Though the series is designed for kids, both kids and adults alike will be able to learn everything they need to know about playing go in a fun and entertaining way.</li>
<li>People who enjoy learning things in an easy to understand format and lots of opportunities to reinforce what they are learning.</li>

Something interesting happened yesterday. I had just finished the arc in <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;ved=0CC8QFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FFighting_Spirit_(manga)&amp;ei=6IoOUrG_FaWbygGL6oCwAg&amp;usg=AFQjCNFFI0eP4wTVR8AszqReTx_t5ZpG1w&amp;sig2=vGXcojo8m7DpILIfiStOww&amp;bvm=bv.50768961,d.aWc">Hajime no Ippo</a> where Volg fights for a world title. And since I was looking to possibly play a game in real time, I got excited when I saw the chance to play someone from Russia. (For those who don&#8217;t understand the connection, Volg is a Russian boxer.) Before I knew it, I find myself neck deep in a complicated cross-fuseki game where all the fighting spirit I had been reading about had gotten into my blood and I was trying to strike at all of my opponent&#8217;s groups with everything I had.<br />
There was one particular moment (towards the end of the game) where I found myself in a rather precarious situation where I could either make certain of absolute life or leave it up to a capturing race. I know that the old me (and probably a lot of other players) would have probably chosen the sure route to life. However, it felt kind of surreal as I glanced at the position and realized that I could just tenuki because I already knew the end-result of the capturing race: Black would never win due to a shortage of liberties.<br />
The reason I&#8217;m writing about this is because I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve ever captured this kind of moment before in my journey. Do you know what I mean? It&#8217;s that moment where suddenly your training is starting to show its results and you feel as if something has dawned on you.Â In other words, all those tedious problems that I had practiced in the Level Up books had begun to show their true colors. Without much effort, I looked at my position and knew there was nothing to worry about.<br />
I know that I have been kind of out of it the past week; but what happened in yesterday&#8217;s game is a testament to my efforts before. And I think it&#8217;s just what I needed to kick my butt back into gear with my training. Time to revisit my training menu once again!</p>

[expand title=&#8221;Before I Read This Book&#8230;&#8221; trigclass=&#8221;expandTitle&#8221;]
<strong>My Abilities</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A mid to high SDK (single digit kyu) kyu who has read his fair share of go books and has a pretty strong foundation in the basics and teaching go.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>My Perspective</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>After reading <a title="Book Review: Level UpÂ 1" href="//book-review-level-up-1/">Level Up 1</a>, I was just excited to get started on the second book and keep the momentum going!</li>
</ul>
[/expand]
[expand title=&#8221;My Review&#8221; trigclass=&#8221;expandTitle&#8221;Â expanded=&#8221;true&#8221;]
<strong>What did I enjoy about the book?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>It forces you to review (and inadvertently reinforce) what you learned in <a title="Book Review: Level UpÂ 1" href="//book-review-level-up-1/">Level Up 1</a>.</li>
<li>Introduces life and death at its most fundamental level (i.e.,making your second eye) and drills the reader in finding it or taking it away.</li>
<li>Spends a lot of time on ladders and gives the reader lots of opportunity to practice reading simple ladders. This is one of my favorite parts about this book since ladders are something that most players tend to shy away from.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What did I gain from reading this book?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Polishing my ladder reading abilities.</li>
<li>Polishing my ability to accurately read out multiple variations since I&#8217;m double checking why the other answer doesn&#8217;t work.</li>
<li>Better understanding of how to break down concepts like ladders when teaching go to newer players.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What style of teaching does the book use?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Workbook Approach
<ul>
<li>There are less explanations and more problems in this book, but any reader who has diligently followed practiced the problems from <a title="Book Review: Level UpÂ 1" href="//book-review-level-up-1/">Level Up 1</a> should have no issues solving the problems.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Primary Learning Mechanism
<ul>
<li>Solving problems.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Other Learning Mechanisms
<ul>
<li>Cute comics to illustrate concepts like, &#8220;Before capturing your opponent, look at your own weak points.&#8221;</li>
<li>Multiple choice questions such as,&#8221; Who has made better territory?&#8221;</li>
<li>Kifus (i.e., game records) that are only around 10 moves long with short one line statements of the move&#8217;s purpose.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What aspects can be improved on?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The concept of chokchoksu (which is essentially shortage of liberties) should be introduced earlier on since there are a number of problems that use it in the solution.</li>
<li>The answer book for Question #2 for page 163 should be &#8220;net.&#8221;</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Is this book easy to read?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Yes. It was very easy to progress through the book.</li>
