For most of the time I studied go, I was always focused on getting the right answer. Perhaps this is a result of being conditioned from school and being obsessed with answering the question correctly, but nonetheless it showed up in my approach to studying go. So more often than not, if I managed to guess what the correct answer was for a particular problem, that would be the end of it and I would move on to the next problem. After all, I got the right answer and that&#8217;s what&#8217;s important isn&#8217;t it?<br />
Of course, the next question is what happened if I got the answer wrong. Well, since I got the answer wrong, the logical choice would be to see what the correct answer is and try to memorize it. In other words, I would focus on understanding why the correct answer was correct and was less concerned with why my answer was wrong. Standard studying mechanism for taking any test in a class right?<br />
Unfortunately, while that sounds okay in theory and may have helped me get through school rather easily, it turns out I have been barking up the wrong tree this entire time.<br />
<span id="more-5370"></span><br />
Recently, fellow go player saxmaam gave her recommendation for <a title="Talent Code Audible Link" href="http://www.audible.com/pd/Science-Technology/The-Talent-Code-Audiobook/B002V8L6MA">The Talent Code</a> by Daniel Coyle, which is themed on the idea of &#8220;unlocking the secret to learning just about any skill.&#8221; I had heard of the book before and been told to read it in the past, but I was too caught up in other things at the time and never got around to it. However, as my approach and perspective on go has been undergoing a lot of transformation recently, so I decided to take it as a sign from the universe that it was time to finally read it.<br />
I haven&#8217;t finished it yet, but I was presented with an idea that inspired the post for today: <strong>one of the key components to learning a skill is making mistakes along the way</strong>. In other words, the essence of getting stronger resides in the struggle it takes to the correct answer and not simply finding the correct answer. And though it seems like such an obvious statement, it is one that I ignored for most of my journey as a go player.<br />
One of the things Coyle talks about is that people who master skills often spend a lot of time focused on what he calls &#8220;deliberate learning.&#8221; In other words, there is a significant conscious effort to constantly critically analyze and patch up weaknesses as the person encounters them. A good analogy for this would be like learning how to play a song on an instrument. Instead of simply trying to play through the whole thing and just barely getting by the tough parts of the song, a person will spend the time to really struggle with that section until they get it right before resuming with the rest of the song.<br />
I grew up playing piano for most of my life and spent many years and hours in the field of music. And when I think back to it, I am rather ashamed of the fact that I was not always the most disciplined when it came to this kind of &#8220;deliberate learning.&#8221; In fact, my thought was always if I could get through most of song without a problem, it would be good enough. After all, who could tell the difference as long as I wasn&#8217;t perfect for the entire song. 80-90% should be good enough right?<br />
When it came to go, the habit of &#8220;winging&#8221; it and getting by with only a general understanding of what was going on became the foundation of how I studied the game. And as a result, the time and energy I spent studying the game was more leisurely and less &#8220;deliberate learning.&#8221;<br />
Upon reflection of my past, I realize now that I was wrong to avoid that stage of struggling during learning. For most of my life, I always felt that if I was struggling, then it was some sign of failure and/or ineptitude. And though you&#8217;ll think I was crazy, I really did think that things coming easy to a person was a sign of talent and the mark of potential success. Perhaps it&#8217;s because I was always surrounded by people more brilliant than I, but those ideas were a part of me for a long time.<br />
I wanted to write this post because I don&#8217;t believe I&#8217;m the only one out there making this mistake. And though I haven&#8217;t figured out the magical equation for how one can ensure they are using &#8220;deliberate learning&#8221; in their study of go (which I will definitely write about when I starting figuring it out), hopefully this post will serve as an inspiration for some of you and a reminder to not get frustrated by those times you struggle with certain ideas and concepts. After all, it is the key to gaining that next stone.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 style="text-align: center;">Weekly Go Wednesday, Issue #37</h2>
<p>Last <a title="Friday Go Forward: Week 58" href="//friday-go-forward-week-58/">Friday</a>, I mentioned an <a title="Lynx's How to Improve at Go" href="http://shobia.com/w/How_to_Improve_at_Go">article</a> that was shared with me on how to improve at go by Lynx. According to conventional wisdom, the one piece of advice that everyone seem to agree upon is that studying life and death is critical to getting stronger. And to be honest, it&#8217;s something I never really questioned. However, after reading Lynx&#8217;s article, I was confronted with an eye-opening question: <strong>Is studying tesuji more useful than tsumego? </strong><br />
After a lot of thought,  I would have to concur  with Lynx&#8217;s perspective. In fact, it is one of the key components to breaking the glass ceiling when trying to gain that next stone. However, because the masses constantly spout how important life and death is, it is often forgotten in all the noise.<br />
<span style="line-height: 1.5em;">Now now, before you grab your pitchforks and torches, hear me out won&#8217;t you?</span><br />
<span id="more-5039"></span><br />
To start, I will go ahead and address probably the strongest argument against Lynx&#8217;s theory: What is the use of tesuji if you die everywhere?<br />
True. If your life and skills are so abysmal that you are slaughtered around the board, I agree with you in that tesuji will not do you much good. However, the reality of the situation is that most games don&#8217;t consist of groups dying all over the board (unless the rank is horribly imbalanced). And though this can partially be attributed to people studying life and death, my personal experience has shown me that the bottom line is that <em>it is really hard to kill groups in go</em>.<br />
Though people might not realize it, I think that players will inevitably learn about life and death as they play. Why do I say this? Because whenever your group dies, it is usually pretty traumatic. Who can remember that time when they thought their corner was alive and then died in a magnificent burst of flames? I know I can recount it on multiple occasions. And what happens when you die? Well usually you might go back to figure out how you could&#8217;ve avoided it. After all, who likes dying?<br />
On top of that, let&#8217;s not forget the fact that players constantly miss tesuji in their games. It is usually very obvious to players who are much stronger, but unless someone is having their game reviewed by such a player, how many people are going to spend time going over their game to figure out the numerous tesuji they missed? Highly unlikely. They are way more likely to just move on and play another game.<br />
In addition, no matter how peaceful a player you are, you are eventually going to get into fights on the board. I&#8217;m sure there are kifu that exists where no one challenged each other at all, but I&#8217;m pretty sure they only exist at the beginner level since they aren&#8217;t aware they are capable of invading and living. And when it comes to fighting, there is no better weapon than being better at tesuji than your opponent.<br />
Who remembers this scene?<br />

Anyhow, was this a move that dealt with life and death? Did Sai&#8217;s incredible move kill the Meijin&#8217;s group? No. It was a brilliant tesuji that made all spectators watch in amazement. And in fact, if you think about it, most of the moves that are met with astonishment and awe in the show are usually tesuji. They are all about how brilliant that connection was, or how this peep is an excellent forcing move that allows XYZ tesuji to work.<br />
Finally, I want to remind you that Lynx&#8217;s point is <strong><em>not</em></strong> to burn all your tsumego books and never life and death. Instead, she&#8217;s simply trying to remind us of how important tesuji are when it comes to gaining that next stone. So the next time you are thinking about what to study, I hope that you&#8217;ll consider making some time to study tesuji in your busy schedule. It&#8217;ll definitely be worth your while in the long run.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Kaz&#8217;s Online Go School is finally here! For those who don&#8217;t know about Kaz, I discovered him from his site (<a href="http://www.kazsensei.com/">http://www.kazsensei.com/</a>) a couple of years ago and have been waiting for his website to become fully live and functional. The website is a bit hard to navigate, but after going through it, I thought that it would be great if I ever got a chance to learn from him. So after waiting for a couple of years, I am psyched to tell you that the opportunity is finally here!<br />
So for those curious about this online go school, let me start with this: <strong>The first session of Kaz&#8217;s Online Go School is 8 classes for only $6 USD.</strong> Now that I have your attention, here&#8217;s my elevator pitch for the school.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>His teaching style emphasizes teaching amateur players who are adults which is quite unique!</strong> In fact, he states in his ad that the range of players he normally teaches is 30 to 70+ years old and talks about how teaching children is very different from teaching adults! So in other words, it sounds like he has a lot of experience working with amateur players (which is precisely what many of us need).</li>
<li><strong>Kaz will generate a text for student&#8217;s to study after each lesson.</strong> It&#8217;s great to get online reviews and such, but I think it&#8217;s great that Kaz will also be generating offline content for students to study as well in order to reinforce the concepts learned from the last lesson.</li>
<li><strong>You get 8 two-hour group lessons with Kaz for only $6 USD.</strong> This is such an incredible value and such a great deal if anyone has done even the slightest bit of research on the other online schools available. For those who haven&#8217;t, one of the most popular online go schools charges about $135 a month. So yeah. &#8216;Nuff said.</li>
</ol>
<p>Bottom line: I think any player who has even been remotely interested in participating in an online go school needs to do this. There is just no reason for why you shouldn&#8217;t give this a shot for $6 USD. It&#8217;s seriously an incredible deal.<a href="//wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Kaz-Go-Problem-Set.zip"><br />
</a><br />
For more details on his school, you can find it here <a href="//wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Kaz’s-Online-Go-School.pdf">Kaz’s Online Go School (PDF)</a>. I took the liberty of taking his email and updating some of the language and structure in order to make it easier to find the information you need. And for those interested in the free problems set that he attached to his email, you can download it [download label=&#8221;here&#8221;]//wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Kaz-Go-Problem-Set.zip[/download].<br />
And just in case it isn&#8217;t clear, I have already paid my $6 and will definitely be participating in this. Let me know if you guys have any other questions and I&#8217;ll do my best to answer them. Hope to see you in class!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 style="text-align: center;">Weekly Go Wednesday, Issue #30</h2>
<p>With 2014 being only eight days old, new year resolutions are still fresh and many people are off trying to pursue their goals (i.e., lose weight, get in shape, etc.). In lieu with that theme, I thought it would be a perfect opportunity to share a video that I was recommended recently. It&#8217;s a <a title="BJ Fogg TEDxTalk on Tiny Habits" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=AdKUJxjn-R8">TEDxTalk by BJ Fogg</a> on the topic of creating real and permanent change in your life through tiny habits.<br />
<iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='720' height='405' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/AdKUJxjn-R8?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe><br />
One of the things that struck me about this talk is how BJ Fogg clearly delineates between goal setting in terms of long term change and short term change. And contrary to what most people think, being highly motivated only contributes to short term change and not long term change. But of course, the question you&#8217;re probably wondering is: how does this relate to go?<br />
<span id="more-4465"></span><br />
I think a lot of players set out grandiose goals for themselves. The most popular examples of this are kyu players who say, &#8220;I will become a dan player this year!&#8221; And while this is a wonderful goal that many are pursuing as I write this post, I think BJ Fogg is correct in that this type of goal setting often leads to short term changes that rarely result in the goal becoming an actual reality. A simple example of this is when I tried to pursue a similar goal by overloading myself with books, problems, games, and so forth. The end result was me getting burned out and still not achieving my goal.<br />
For those wondering why it is incorrect to frame our minds in such a fashion, the reason for this is simple: Goals like becoming a dan player is not as simple as training for a marathon. In the example of trying to run a marathon, it&#8217;s quite easy to strategize how one will achieve their desired goal. By breaking the training into distances that build up to the desired distance, one will be able to reach his/her goal. However, that is not the case for goals like &#8220;Become a dan player.&#8221;<br />
Instead, what BJ Fogg tells us is that <strong>what we need to do is create tiny habits that contribute to the end goal</strong>. In the instance of new year resolutions, we all know that the most popular resolutions always has to do with getting healthier (whether it&#8217;s losing weight or getting in shape). So instead of grandiose goals like &#8220;I will lose 30 lbs.&#8221; or &#8220;I will have a body that looks like Khal Drogo (from Game of Thrones),&#8221; we would create habits like, &#8220;After I use the bathroom, I will do 2 pushups&#8221; or &#8220;Instead of eating donuts for breakfast 5 days a week, I will switch out one day for a bagel instead.&#8221;<br />
So instead of starting out with a grandiose vision like &#8220;become a dan player in one year,&#8221; it is better to start out with habits that contribute to you getting stronger. An example would be, &#8220;I will be play one game a week and review it with a stronger player.&#8221; Another example might be, &#8220;I will watch one video of <a title="GoGameGuru BadukTV English" href="http://gogameguru.com/baduk-tv-library/baduk-tv-english/">BadukTV</a> a week.&#8221; Or if you&#8217;re looking for tiny habits to apply while playing, you can try, &#8220;Every time my opponent plays a move, I will check if I have any weak groups.&#8221; For those who are wondering, my first tiny habit will be, &#8220;Every time I use the restroom, I will do 10 tsumego problems!&#8221;<br />
Slowly over time, these tiny habits will become easier and easier. Once they do, you can up the intensity (i.e., I will play two games a week) or add another tiny habit to your regimen. And then, before you know it, you&#8217;ll find that these tiny habits actually start to make your bigger goals start to become a reality. Or to put it another way:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Plant a tiny seed in the right spot and it will grow without coaxing.&#8221; &#8211; BJ Fogg</p></blockquote>
<p>Best of luck to everyone as you pursue your goals for 2014!</p>

<p>As many of you are aware, I recently started a discipline of playing at least one game a day. And while I am happy to report that I have been keeping up with it, it occurred to me that there are many people out there who would probably like to attempt something similar; but decide not to due to assuming that it would be too &#8220;time consuming.&#8221; So, I thought that I would go ahead and write about my experience on finding time for one game a day.<br />
<span id="more-3981"></span><br />
When I tried playing blitz (e.g., only 5 periods of 10 second byoyomi) in order to satisfy my &#8220;one game a day,&#8221; I found that the game was more of a blur than an experience and felt like I didn&#8217;t gain anything. After all, blitz games are more about intuition than anything else. On the other hand, when I tried to play a game of typical tournament length (e.g., 30 min main time), I would find my games taking anywhere from an hour to two (which any working person who wants any semblance of a life would agree is death). Therefore, after some experimenting with different time settings, I have found that 10 minutes main time and 3x 30 second byoyomi is about right since it strikes a nice balance between intuition and thinking while not taking too much time out of my day.<br />
Some might quote me on how I once stated that even 20 minute main time games were too short for me; however, the key difference between my analysis then and now is the fact that my focus used to be giving myself the most optimal conditions for winning a game. However, I have come to learn that that approach was too slow. I am fully aware and accept the fact that I will make many mistakes and lose many games as a result of not being able to think every move thoroughly, but the consistent practice and application is something that I am hoping will be beneficial in the long run. After all, the goal with this discipline is not to win; but to gain more experience while not putting a huge strain on your time.<br />
So for those who tend to find themselves studying instead of playing, I ask that you give this habit a shot. Whether it&#8217;s just one game every 3 days or just once a week, go out there, get your feet wet and just play. I don&#8217;t care if it&#8217;s under a secret account that you hide away from the rest of the world, but the important thing is that you do it. That way, when the time comes for you to take the plunge and participate in a tournament, you&#8217;ll feel a lot more comfortable with playing a game and have a much better chance of showing what you&#8217;ve been learning instead of losing because you are rusty from playing.<br />
At the end of the day, no matter how good you are at the various aspects of go (i.e., fuseki, joseki, tesuji, life and death, endgame, etc.), you are only as good as your ability to transition between these skills during a game. The faster you are at moving between them, the better your analysis will be and the stronger you will inevitably be. And no matter what anyone else says, there is nothing that can train this ability better than playing games. So what are you waiting for, get out there and play some go!<br />
<em>For anyone who is wondering where I am playing my daily games, I alternate between KGS and Tygem depending on my mood. Lately, I have been more partial to Tygem since it&#8217;s really easy to find a game and I get to play against players much stronger than me. You are welcome to follow me on my alternate account (that I created awhile ago for the 5 dan Tygem training frozensoul suggested to me): zenblade.  </em></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As most of you are aware, I am pretty diligent and hard working when it comes to my studies. The vast quantity of information that I ingest is probably quite frightening for some. The only downside to this, however, is that being able to digest it is a completely different matter. In addition, you have to realize that I am often more focused on finishing the books instead of truly mastering the topic at hand in order to fulfill my goal of having the most comprehensive book reviews for go. So at the end of the day, I have to really question how I&#8217;m really going to get stronger.<br />
I recently finished <a title="Book Review: Commented Games by Lee Sedol: Volume 1" href="//book-review-commented-games-lee-sedol-volume-1/">Commented Games by Lee Sedol, Vol. 1</a>. And in one of his mini monologues about getting stronger, Lee Sedol commented that he believes the fastest way for any player to get stronger is to simply play games. Of course, he recommends reviewing them as well, but the idea lies in the fundamental premise that one learns fastest through experience. And as if that wasn&#8217;t enough to get me questioning my methods, I watched an episode of <em>Hikaru no Go</em> (Episode 25: Fear and Impatience) earlier where Waya makes a comment about how regardless of how talented a player is, it means nothing without playing stronger opponents.<br />
Something tells me the universe is trying to tell me something&#8230; Haha&#8230; So as I&#8217;ve learned in life, it&#8217;s best to listen to the universe when it&#8217;s trying to nudge you along the right path. I will no longer worry about losing games due to lack of time or lack of energy. And from this day forth, I will always find time to play at least one game a day.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It occurred to me recently that it seems that all I do is nothing but study, play or write about go. Though I would love that to be the case, I can assure you that it is not the case. I am like any other working soul in society: I have a 9 to 5 job, I live on my own (which means I have to cook, clean, and do all those non-go related chores xD), I have other interests (e.g., web design, coding, tennis, sports, etc.), and I have more familial responsibility than most might care to have. Nonetheless, I have somehow managed to squeeze in go in between all the other things that I care about. Why am I writing about this? Good question.<br />
In most players pursuit to gain another stone, it seems there is an illusion that in order to do so, you must devote all your time and energy the way an insei does. Whether you believe me or not, nothing could be further from the truth.<br />
The reason why I know I can say this with absolute certainty is that most players&#8217; goal is to simply surpass the kyus and successfully live amongst the dan players. In other words, not become a professional. With that in mind, the first step to continuing progress is to realize that progress in go is rarely (if ever) made in leaps and bounds. Similar to building a house, it is important that every level be built with the most solid foundation possible. Otherwise, when the house gets to 4 to 5 stories high, it won&#8217;t take much for the whole thing to come crashing down.<br />
For those who aspire to be professional players, I applaud your tenacity and ambition. In fact, I would have to admit that even I am secretly hoping to rise to the level of a professional. So believe me when I say that the importance of our growth through one solid step at a time is more critical than anyone else. After all, professionals play at a level where the slightest mistake (such as the timing of one forcing move over another) can make the difference between winning and losing.<br />
To those frustrated with their progress, remember that go is a never ending journey where new ideas will constantly be born. The moment we think we know what we&#8217;re doing and have some new &#8220;sure-win&#8221; strategy, someone will come along and blow it away. So just keep at it with an unrelenting discipline to study (even if only for 10 minutes a day) and to focus on playing inspired games where you learn something rather than simply winning. Once you&#8217;ve grasped that, the depth and bottomless pit of wisdom that go has to offer will open its doors to you.</p>

</ul>
<p><span id="more-1393"></span></p>
<h3>Detailed Review</h3>
<h4>Readability &#8211; 10 / 10</h4>
<p>When it comes to readability, I&#8217;m not sure there&#8217;s a single go book out there that can outclass Kageyama&#8217;s ability to show his humorous and delightful personality through his writing. There is almost never a dull moment in this book. Often times, he will seem to be going off on a tangent (like baseball), but he will always find a way to bring it back full circle to emphasize one of his points. His pragmatic and straight forward advice is something that every go player can make use of, regardless of how strong you desire to be. In fact, even if we set aside the actual treasure trove of go advice that is in this book, I would argue that the entertainment value of his writing makes the book worth every penny.</p>
<h4>Content Quality &#8211; 10 / 10</h4>
<p>Although this is not your classic tsumego book, it does have a similar style to the <a href="http://senseis.xmp.net/?ElementaryGoSeries">Elementary Go Series</a> where there are a few problems at the end of most chapters. In addition, I will be the first to admit that some of these problems are rather difficult and can be discouraging if you are under the impression you need to be able to solve them the first time you see them. In fact, the value of this book lies in its ability to expose you to so many different concepts and ideas. Considering the size of the book and the how short each of the chapters are, the amount of content he covers is nothing short of incredible.</p>
<h4>Final Thoughts</h4>
<p>Although this is my third time reading the book, and it still has not lost a bit of its charm. I continue to learn something new every time I read it, and never fail to crack a smile when Kageyama goes on one of his rants about how amateur players always try to find shortcuts to reading ladders. Nonetheless, this is truly a classic that I believe will never be outdated. So do yourself a favor, and if you are going to only have a small collection of go books, this is definitely one you will want to have.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 style="text-align: center"><em>Weekly Go Wednesday, Issue #14</em></h2>
<p><a href="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2013/01/wgw14.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1723" alt="Proofreading Credit to TitanWebMarketingSolutoins" src="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2013/01/wgw14.jpg?resize=300%2C235" width="300" height="235" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><br />
While nothing can replace the experience of playing games, one of the greatest mistakes that players make is to play games endlessly without any mind as to why they are winning or losing. There is nothing wrong with this approach as a whole, but it is contrary to the whole notion of getting stronger. After all, how can anyone learn from their mistake if they never knew it existed?<br />
The one thing we have to remember as kyu players is that we often fall victim to being ignorant to fundamental go principles. It&#8217;s not so much that we&#8217;re not aware of them, but applying them in our game is a completely different story. Often times in the middle of a game, we will think one way and will not realize our mistake till later on. As a result, an extremely important aspect of getting stronger is to review your games.<br />
<span id="more-1717"></span><br />
Here is an overall guideline (in order of level of effort) as to how you should approach your game reviews:<br />
<strong>#1. Start by reviewing the game on your own (or with a friend).</strong><br />
Casually go through the game and see what things you might have done differently, or how you think the game might have gone if you had responded differently. The important thing to remember is not to spend a lot of time going over the game, but to go over any mistakes you&#8217;ve made and learn from it as best as you possibly can. This is the absolute bare minimum you should do after each game.<br />
<strong>#2. Get a stronger player to review your game (preferably at least 3 stones stronger than you).</strong><br />
Stronger players fulfill the gap that we lack when it comes to understanding why certain things work and certain things don&#8217;t. In fact, it is their guidance that helps bring us back from the edge of self-delusion when one of our &#8220;brilliant tesujis&#8221; turns out to be easily countered by a different response. So make no mistake, this type of review can do wonders for your understanding of the game.<br />
<strong>#3. Come prepared to a game review with a stronger player (again, preferably at least 3 stones stronger).</strong><br />
If you want to get the most out of your reviews, come to a review prepared to with the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Pick three moves that you are really proud of.</li>
<li>Pick three moves that you were not sure about.</li>
<li>Pick three moves that you thought were bad in hindsight.</li>
</ol>
<p>By doing this, you will be doing yourself a huge favor since your reviewer will have a clear insight into how you are thinking. In addition, this will allow the reviewer to easily tailor the lessons towards your habits and style of play instead of making it generic.<br />
So yes. While <a title="Even Games with Stronger Players" href="//even-games-with-stronger-players/">last week&#8217;s Weekly Go Wednesday</a> focused on how playing against stronger players against stronger players is a good method for getting stronger, the game reviews that come afterwards can make the difference between feeling awful about yourself and having your eyes opened to brand new possibilities.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 style="text-align: center"><em>Weekly Go Wednesday, Issue #13</em></h2>
<p><a href="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2013/01/wgw13.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1677" alt="wgw13" src="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2013/01/wgw13.jpg?resize=300%2C342" width="300" height="342" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left">Whenever a player says that they&#8217;ve hit a wall in their growth, the first question I would ask every player is: Are you playing any even games with stronger players? That&#8217;s right. Are you putting yourself in a precarious situation where defeat is practically guaranteed? And before you go rushing off to write your rebuttal in the comments, here me out in the following Q&amp;A:</p>
<p style="text-align: left"><span id="more-1658"></span></p>
<p><em>&#8220;Ben. Are you out of your mind?! What are you trying to do? Ruin any remaining self-esteem I have and enjoyment in playing go?&#8221;</em><br />
No no. I assure you that I only have the best intentions in mind for you when I suggest such a seemingly crazy idea. And the bottom line is, if you are looking for ways to get stronger, I sincerely believe that playing even games against stronger players gives you an opportunity to elevate your game to the next level.<br />
<em>&#8220;But Ben, I am already losing to people around my level. Why would I want to increase my losing streak by playing even games against stronger players?&#8221;</em><br />
Well here&#8217;s the thing, if you are at a roadblock in your growth, what do you ever expect to gain from playing against people around the same rank? The level of play that you will constantly be exposed to will be at the same level. As a result, you will just continue to play to play moves of that level. When playing a stronger player in an even game, you find out very quickly when something you thought was a &#8220;correct&#8221; move is actually just a bad idea.<br />
<em>&#8220;Okay fine, but I play handicap games! Shouldn&#8217;t that be enough?&#8221;</em><br />
Nope. The one thing you have to remember is that handicap games are very difficult to learn from since handicap games are lopsided by nature. Your opponent will make a lot of unusual plays that may seem &#8220;high level&#8221; to you, but in reality they are overplays that would only hurt you in the long run if you try and learn from them.<br />
<em>&#8220;But my rank will drop like crazy!!!&#8221;</em><br />
Even though stronger players are the ones who really should be worrying about having their ranks messed up, my idea is centered around the idea of playing free games with stronger players. By doing this, you will find more opponents to play and not have to worry about your own rank.<br />
<em>&#8220;Okay, but I don&#8217;t know any stronger players and it&#8217;s not like I would even know why my move is bad or their move is better.&#8221;</em><br />
Fair enough. This is why I recommend that anyone who is unable to obtain any kind of private lessons to join the Advanced Study Room. It is a completely free insei-type program where you will have many opportunities to play people that are stronger than you. In addition, most of the stronger players are always happy to help you review a game. And as if that wasn&#8217;t enough, you can actually earn prizes if you do well!<br />
So bottom line: if you feel like you&#8217;re in a rut, it&#8217;s time to push your limits, expand your horizons, and have your eyes opened up by stronger players so that you can better grasp what areas you need to work on to reach the next level.</p>
