For Game 3 of the epic <a title="Gu Li and Lee Sedol Jubango" href="//gu-li-lee-sedol-jubango/">jubango</a> between Lee Sedol (9P) and Gu Li (9P), we have arrived at a crucial point. Lee Sedol is already 2-0 (<a title="WGW 31: Gu Li vs Lee Sedol — Jubango Game 1 Amateur Review" href="//wgw-31-gu-li-vs-lee-sedol-jubango-game-1-amateur-review/">Game 1</a> and <a title="WGW 33: Gu Li vs Lee Sedol — Jubango Game 2 Amateur Review" href="//wgw-33-gu-li-vs-lee-sedol-jubango-game-2-amateur-review/">Game 2</a>) and there is concern that the jubango will end earlier than desired. After all, everyone wants to see all 10 games. However, the rules of the jubango is that the first to six victories win. As a result, for this game, even Lee Sedol fans were rooting for Gu Li to turn the tide so that we could see more games.<br />
For those who don&#8217;t keep up with the professional scene, Gu Li had managed to beat Lee Sedol in two other tournament matches prior to this game, so even though there was concern that there would be too much pressure on Gu Li, people had high hopes that Gu Li would be able to make a comeback this game.<br />
As with the previous reviews (<a title="WGW 31: Gu Li vs Lee Sedol — Jubango Game 1 Amateur Review" href="//wgw-31-gu-li-vs-lee-sedol-jubango-game-1-amateur-review/">Game 1</a> and <a title="WGW 33: Gu Li vs Lee Sedol — Jubango Game 2 Amateur Review" href="//wgw-33-gu-li-vs-lee-sedol-jubango-game-2-amateur-review/">Game 2</a>), this review continues to be geared towards kyu players who struggle with the advanced analysis and discussion that normally occurs between dan and professional level players. There is commentary for every move so that hopefully you won&#8217;t ever feel lost. In addition, I am happy to announce that frozensoul (5d) has joined forces with me again for this game review. Many thanks goes out to him for providing a number of the insights you&#8217;ll see throughout the review.<br />
Just like before, please let me know if you notice anything or have any suggestions that I can do to improve the review. I look forward to getting your feedback on this game review. Hope you enjoy it and learn a thing or two through it!<br />

[expand title=&#8221;Before I Read This Book&#8230;&#8221; trigclass=&#8221;expandTitle&#8221;]
<strong>My Abilities</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>I&#8217;ve read a fair number of books on the opening, so I feel decently comfortable with my opening abilities; but still not very confident in them.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>My Perspective</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>I was hoping that this book would help to clarify some of my misconceptions and boost my confidence in my opening abilities.</li>
</ul>
[/expand]
[expand title=&#8221;Synopsis&#8221; trigclass=&#8221;expandTitle&#8221;]
<strong>What did I enjoy about the book?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Covers four very popular fuseki: Chinese (high and low), ninren-sei, sanren-sei, and the Shusaku opening.</li>
<li>The problems are realistic and really help the reader to work through the process of where the best response really is, especially when you consider the purpose of each fuseki.</li>
<li>The problems build on themselves as you progres through the book. This helps to maintain continuity of what is being learned and is really helpful.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What did I gain from reading this book?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>An increased awareness for how to interpet the board position during the opening.</li>
<li>Greater sensitivity to weak groups and how to handle them.</li>
<li>Higher comfort level when it comes to the opening.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What style of teaching does the book use?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Drill Seargent Style
<ul>
<li>Once you get your direction, it&#8217;s do or die as you attempt to pick the right answer!</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Primary Learning Mechanism:
<ul>
<li>Practice Problems</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Other Learning Mechanisms:
<ul>
<li>Short introduction to the fusekis used in the book.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What aspects can be improved on?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Trivial request: It would be cool to see problems on the Orthodox fuseki.</li>
<li>I know this is due to book size constraints, but it would have been cool to see explanations for why every other options (in the multiple choice problems) are considered &#8220;failures&#8221; to the correct answer.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Is this book easy to read?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Yes. All the diagrams are only a few moves long and not to mention the explanations are all concise and only a paragraph long tops.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Bottom Line</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Covers situations that generally arise from typical openings from popular fuseki (e.g., Chinese, sanren-sei, etc.).</li>
<li>A fantastic introductory/intermediate level book with practice problems on the opening.</li>
<li>A must have for anyone looking to strengthen their understanding of the opening.</li>
</ol>
[/expand]
[expand title=&#8221;My Review&#8221; trigclass=&#8221;expandTitle&#8221; expanded=&#8221;true&#8221;]
Though this book has been sitting on my shelf for quite some time, I must admit that I am so glad that I finally got around to it. The way that Bozulich forces the reader to consider different board positions at different points of the opening was really eye opening. I would say that I would get the answer right about 40-50% of the time, but oftentimes when I was wrong my eyes were opened up to a whole new concept. So while it was great to be right at times, I found the explanations to be extremely valuable in teaching me something new.<br />
Granted, I look forward to the day where I can go through this book again and get everything correct without any effort at all; but until that day comes, this book will definitely remain a classic when it comes to providing excellent quality problems for the opening along with fantastic explanations.<br />
[/expand]
[expand title=&#8221;Recommended For&#8230;&#8221; trigclass=&#8221;expandTitle&#8221;]
<ul>
<li>Players with some basic knowledge of the opening who want to gain more familiarity with proper moves in the opening.</li>
<li>Players who want to get a better understanding of how to interpret the board position.</li>
</ul>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So as some of you might have noticed, I&#8217;ve been playing a lot more games recently. However, it seems I am on a losing streak; but it&#8217;s not all bad since it means I&#8217;m back in experimental mode. My rank has even dropped down to 6k it seems, but this is partially due to the fact that I haven&#8217;t played enough ranked games where I actually have time to think. So I really don&#8217;t give much credence to my rank drop.<br />
I know for most people, the losing streak plus rank drop is enough to go on a rampage and think about quitting the game. In actuality though, I have found it&#8217;s really important to focus on the cause of the loss instead of the loss itself. Perhaps it&#8217;s simple reading error? Or perhaps just a rigid approach to the game. Either way, I always find comfort knowing that I have the capability to make a change in my game if I choose. It&#8217;s just a matter of swallowing my pride and a willingness to overcome the obstacles that stand in my way.<br />
On a separate note, I have kept true to my promise on sealing away the Chinese Opening. It has yet to make an appearance even though I am on a losing streak. However, I am not tempted in the slightest to bring it back out yet. After all, for those who read Hajime no Ippo, I feel like the Chinese Opening is kind of like my &#8220;Dempsey Roll.&#8221; I am quite skilled at utilizing it to great effectiveness; but there&#8217;s been so much study on it that I must seal it away for now. Once I patch up my other weaknesses though, I have a feeling that I will be able to unleash something fearsome when I finally break the seal on it.</p>

<p>We&#8217;re taking a break from handicap games this week and revisiting a game that I got to play with my longtime friend and rival Nate! It is a game that is fraught with big swings and a big case of kyu tunnel vision from both players. This is probably one of my last Chinese fuseki games for a while, so I hope that you enjoy it!<br />

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 style="text-align: center;">Introduction</h2>
<p>With my own games being rather all over the place lately, I decided to try something new and review a game that I had a chance to see live online. This is between an insei in China (Black) and a Chinese professional (White). Since the Chinese Opening is currently a big part of my go, this game was the best choice since I got to see how stronger players not only utilize the Chinese Opening, but how they dealt with a mirror opening.</p>
