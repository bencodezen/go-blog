				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 style="text-align: center;">Introduction</h2>
<p>For the second Monday Go Meditation of 2014, I thought it would be great to feature the game where my sensei (frozensoul) and I played a game together online. While this was not rengo, it was a really interesting experience to have frozensoul&#8217;s input on the game while I was playing. You very quickly come to realize how differently high dan level players actually think. I hope that you enjoy this game and see the difference I&#8217;m talking about. =D<br />

<p style="text-align: center;">It&#8217;s okay if your opponent keeps trying to kill your probe stone, it&#8217;s actually really hard to truly silence it.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Today I played an interesting teaching game with frozensoul. After losing (as I normally do), he made a very insightful comment about my play: I have a tendency to settle positions quickly. In other words, instead of keeping my options open, I choose to instead play out a local area to completion before I&#8217;m entirely sure of what my strategy is for the game. As a result, it becomes a lot easier for stronger opponents to figure out what I&#8217;m aiming at and ultimately nullify it.<br />
Though I try to keep as open a mind as possible in every game, it seems that I still fail to appreciate how much freedom players actually have during a game. You want to play three moves in a corner to try and eliminate my stone&#8217;s aji? No problem. I&#8217;ll go ahead and take the 2 other big points on the board and laugh maniacally later when my stone&#8217;s aji still comes back to bite you in the butt.<br />
No longer do I wish to be imprisoned by my own volition and stubbornness. Go is a game of freedom. So from this moment forth, I will stop trying to see the game from the confines of everything I learned thus far. Instead, I will try to see the board as it truly is: a beautifully endless depth of possibilities and creativity.</p>

<p>For today&#8217;s go meditation, I am showing the game where I became more aware of the impact of moves on a whole board scale in regards to &#8220;slow&#8221; moves along with how differentiating between active and passive moyos caused a shift in how I now valued certain moves. It is a teaching game that is a bit short, but hopefully it helps to illustrate what went on in my mind during that game.<br />

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Last night I played a fun game against my friend Nate, but was definitely demolished by the end of the game. A 40 point loss&#8230; hahaha. Thought I admit that there was definitely a degree of disappointment in myself for playing so terribly, there is a silver lining in my complete failure.<br />
So my experiment failed miserably, but I am sure that the experience I gained with be valuable in the future. In addition, I am happy knowing that my mistakes were not reading mistakes this time around. Though I may have made plenty of strategic and whole board errors, reducing the number of reading mistakes should prove to be very lethal once I take care of my flawed strategies. For those wondering about the kifu, it&#8217;ll be featured on a Monday Go Meditation in a couple of weeks.<br />
Meanwhile, I have also decided to take my sensei&#8217;s advice and take the time to really watch <a href="http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCYMY6j5mUvPMPzvN5bxuKA">Battousai&#8217;s</a> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLv8NkgCbtGytYtHKchRMLh9l2KVlqW1z6">3D Tygem Series</a>. Perhaps I can follow in his footsteps and gain sudden insight into the game through watching the series. Not sure how it will go, but I&#8217;ll be sure to let you know if anything changes.</p>

In an effort not to spoil it for anyone who plans on reading or watching the show, all I will say is that his faithfulness to his fundamentals was incredibly moving. No matter what the situation, people&#8217;s faith in the fundamentals is what allow them to pull themselves out of the most difficult situations.<br />
Aside from that though, I&#8217;ve had one of the most eye opening lessons to date. My whole perspective on moyos and just go in general has completely changed. Granted, integrating this new perspective into my play will probably be terribly exhausting for awhile; but ho ho ho&#8230;. this could change everything&#8230;</p>
