				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I haven&#8217;t had a chance to really talk about this much, but I&#8217;m actually going to be headed to Hong Kong in less than a week! As you might expect, it&#8217;s been a busy rush to get all my ducks in line and make sure I don&#8217;t have any lingering things to do when I leave.<br />
One of the things I&#8217;m pondering about however, is how I&#8217;m going to be utilizing my time during those long hours on the plane. I&#8217;m debating bringing a magnetic go set so I can use it on the plane, but then I worry that I&#8217;ll spill the bowls and all the pieces will go everywhere on the plane. Still a little on the fence about what I&#8217;m going to do, but so far it seems like I might just use it to do some serious life and death studying. I&#8217;m open to suggestions though!<br />
Most importantly, <strong>if ANYONE has any connections to people who play go in Hong Kong (or know a friend of a friend who might be able to help me out)</strong>, please let me know since I would love to be able to do at least one go related activity while in Hong Kong. It would be awesome if I could play with some locals and have something go-related to commemorate the trip with!<br />
I definitely will be doing a post on my Hong Kong trip after I get back, but I&#8217;m really hoping to have some go-related material in there if possible. Although worst case scenario, you&#8217;ll just have to endure numerous photos of food and stories instead. Guess that&#8217;s not so bad right? But it would definitely be epic if I could have at least one go anecdote in there, here&#8217;s to hoping&#8230;</p>
