				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 style="text-align: left;">Overview</h2>
<p>This week has been a great continuation of my new philosophy of gaining <a title="Experience on the Battlefield" href="//experience-on-the-battlefield/">experience on the battlefield</a>. I&#8217;ve always felt that experience on the battlefield was necessary, but it wasn&#8217;t until I really started taking it seriously that I&#8217;ve come to understand the depth of that fundamental truth. In fact, as a result of me playing more games (and of course losing more often), I was actually able to win my third round of <a title="Yunguseng Dojang Official Site" href="http://www.yunguseng.com/">Yunguseng Dojang</a>! So within a week, I already have some proof of the method working!<br />
As you will notice, my training regimen has been trimmed a bit. Unlike the past however, the reason I&#8217;ve decided to trim it down is not because it&#8217;s burning me out or anything of the sort, but instead it&#8217;s a matter of having some other activities I need to prioritize at the moment. And to be clear, what I write in the &#8220;Training Regimen&#8221; section is what I am requiring myself to work on everyday. When I have some extra time, then I will be doing other things as well.<br />
Hope that all is well with everyone and that you all have a great Memorial Day weekend!</p>

<h2>Lessons Learned</h2>
<ul>
<li>Just because you have a three in a row shape inside your opponent’s group doesn’t mean it’s dead. Seki is possible too. (-_-)</li>
<li>When you are about to start a fight, make sure that you are not at a disadvantage.</li>
<li>A ponnuki with an empty triangle is not as efficient early on as you might think.</li>
<li>Do not underestimate the power of a good extension from your thickness.</li>
</ul>
