				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So I had the pleasant surprise of having Justin watch over one of my games tonight.  It&#8217;s always funny how obvious the mistakes I make are when a stronger player points them out&#8230; or more obvious moves.  But he did leave me with an interesting thought&#8230;<br />
&#8220;As a word of advice, just do problems.  Focus on the fundamentals.  Everything else will come later.&#8221;<br />
I think that may be where my training is a bit lacking at this point.  I keep reading more theory type books, but have neglected my problems.  Looks like I&#8217;m going to switch gears starting October.  SDK (Single Digit Kyu) may be out of reach by this point, but we&#8217;ll set a new target when my second month is up.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So I visited the Greater Washington Go Club today.  Man&#8230; it was definitely a different experience playing with people in person.  I met a lot of great people, and my cousin and I learned a whole ton through their helpful comments and lessons.  We spent a lot of time playing out various positions based on the 3-3 point invasion on the 4-4 star, and that was super helpful.<br />
In addition to having a couple games commented on, I also experienced my first full game between two dan level players.  That was awesome.  And it reminds me of how much work I have to do before I can even be considered an average player.  So it&#8217;s time I get back to my studies.<br />
Shout outs go out to Hal, Betsy, and Justin for helping out.  I&#8217;m sorry but I&#8217;m totally blanking out on three other names, but thanks for making the experience an awesome one.</p>
