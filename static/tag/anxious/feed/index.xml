				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The first month of <a title="Yunguseng Dojang Official Site" href="http://www.yunguseng.com/">Yunguseng Dojang</a> (YSD) is almost over and you know what that means: top two players get promoted while the bottom two players get demoted. And as you might have guessed from the title of the post, I am on thin ice this month.<br />
Based on my calculations of how the rest of the players in my league will do, everything hinges on my final game this Thursday. My opponent is already guaranteed a spot in League A, so for some reason I feel even more pressure since he holds the key to my fate next month.<br />
To my surprise, I am more worried and stressed out about this than I would have imagined. Perhaps it&#8217;s due to sheer ego and desire to remain in the top class, but I do feel pressure to stay in League A next month.<br />
Ah well. No point sitting here dreading and worrying about it. Off to prepare what I can before the game.</p>
