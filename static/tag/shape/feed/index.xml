[expand title=&#8221;Before I Read This Book&#8230;&#8221; trigclass=&#8221;expandTitle&#8221;]
<strong>My Abilities</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A mid-high SDK (single digit kyu) who has read his fair share of books and has a decent foundation of most areas in go.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>My Perspective</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Since these are written to be more of a &#8220;workshop&#8221; format, I was looking forward to a new style of writing along with a refreshing perspective on some common questions that most players might have.</li>
</ul>
[/expand]
[expand title=&#8221;Synopsis&#8221; trigclass=&#8221;expandTitle&#8221;]
<strong>What did I enjoy about the book?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>As usual, Yang continues to breakdown topics into simple explanations that I could easily understand.</li>
<li>The topics are extremely relevant to the average player since a majority of go literature assumes that the reader is already familiar and well versed in these basic concepts.</li>
<li>There is some great illustration of seemingly complete positions and some advice as to how to go about destroying it.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What did I gain from reading this book?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A better understanding of what defines good and bad shape. Though applying it is still a whole separate matter.</li>
<li>Realization that my understanding of fighting is completely wrong.</li>
<li>Better grasp of what is considered a &#8220;slow&#8221; vs. &#8220;fast&#8221; move.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What style of teaching does the book use?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Workshop Format
<ul>
<li>Topics of broken down into its simplest format and represents more of an outline than a thorough textbook.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Primary Learning Mechanism:
<ul>
<li>Explanations with accompanying diagrams</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Other Learning Mechanisms:
<ul>
<li>Practice problems</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What aspect can be improved on?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Though the examples can be helpful, I still found myself a little unsure of myself regarding whether I really understood the material. So some practice problems would have been nice.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Is this book easy to read?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Yes. The explanations are concise and the accompanying diagrams are often no more than a few moves long.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Bottom Line</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Breaks down topics into easy to understand explanations.</li>
<li>Has a lot of valuable content for such a short book!</li>
<li>Worth every penny you spend on it!</li>
</ol>
[/expand]
[expand title=&#8221;My Review&#8221; trigclass=&#8221;expandTitle&#8221; expanded=&#8221;true&#8221;]
Though I was not as fond of Volume 3, I really enjoyed all of the topics that were covered here in this volume. Topics such as shape and fast vs. slow moves have always interested me and I&#8217;m always glad to learn about it from a different perspective. In addition, this is the first time that I&#8217;ve seen go literature cover something as unqiue as &#8220;playing a fighting opening!&#8221; So with all these unique and fascinating topics, I have to say that this is probably my favorite one thus far.<br />

<h3>Detailed Review</h3>
<h4>Readability &#8211; 10 / 10</h4>
<p>When it comes to readability, I&#8217;m not sure there&#8217;s a single go book out there that can outclass Kageyama&#8217;s ability to show his humorous and delightful personality through his writing. There is almost never a dull moment in this book. Often times, he will seem to be going off on a tangent (like baseball), but he will always find a way to bring it back full circle to emphasize one of his points. His pragmatic and straight forward advice is something that every go player can make use of, regardless of how strong you desire to be. In fact, even if we set aside the actual treasure trove of go advice that is in this book,Â I would argue that the entertainment value of his writing makes the book worth every penny.</p>
<h4>Content Quality &#8211; 10 / 10</h4>
<p>Although this is not your classic tsumego book, it does have a similar style to the <a href="http://senseis.xmp.net/?ElementaryGoSeries">Elementary Go Series</a> where there are a few problems at the end of most chapters. In addition, I will be the first to admit that some of these problems are rather difficult and can be discouraging if you are under the impression you need to be able to solve them the first time you see them. In fact, the value of this book lies in its ability to expose you to so many different concepts and ideas. Considering the size of the book and the how short each of the chapters are, the amount of content he covers is nothing short of incredible.</p>
<h4>Final Thoughts</h4>
<p>Although this is my third time reading the book, and it still has not lost a bit of its charm. I continue to learn something new every time I read it, and never fail to crack a smile when Kageyama goes on one of his rants about how amateur players always try to find shortcuts to reading ladders. Nonetheless, this is truly a classic that I believe will never be outdated. So do yourself a favor, and if you are going to only have a small collection of go books, this is definitely one you will want to have.</p>

<p><span id="more-1546"></span></p>
<h3>Detailed Review</h3>
<h4>Readability &#8211; 9 / 10</h4>
<p>While a large portion of this book is focused on problems, the first chapter consists of explanations regarding shape concepts and theories. Overall, it is relatively easy to understand and read. It can be rather dense at times, but this is something you want from a book that is focused solely on a topic that doesn&#8217;t receive very much attention. Like any other tsumego book, the diagrams and solutions are quite straightforward. The only time I would imagine anyone would have any difficulty following the content would be at the end when example games are given. Then again, I always find those hard to follow and truly grasp anything from. So as a result, I&#8217;m not including it in the evaluation.</p>
<h4>Content Quality &#8211; 10 / 10</h4>
<p>As I mentioned before, this book consists of both a theoretical/conceptual part and a tsumego part. The theory section of the book is done remarkably well and deserves nothing but the highest of accolades in terms of collecting all the various insights on shape into one chapter. In addition, the tsumego section covers a wide variety of game positions that I have personally seen. This only helps to further drive home concepts that we are being exposed to. In addition, the explanations are quite detailed for a tsumego and does a good job covering typical responses that players might choose and why they are not very good.</p>
<h4>Final Thoughts</h4>
<p>Unlike typical tsumego books, approach this book as you would a theory based book. In other words, the goal of the book is being exposed to new concepts and not &#8220;solving the problem.&#8221; Spend a couple minutes or so on each one, but no more, since the solution is often (at least for me) different from what you can come up with.Â Once you&#8217;ve done that, flip over to the solution and see why the authors chose the answer they did.<br />
The reason for this approach is that your goal is to be exposed to new concepts and ideas regarding good shape. Although the format of the book may be in terms of &#8220;problems&#8221; and &#8220;solutions,&#8221; there is no true right or wrong. If anything, you should try to see it as &#8220;better&#8221; or &#8220;more efficient.&#8221; By approaching the book in this manner, you will gain far more and find it far less frustrating since you will not feel bad for not having the &#8220;right answer.&#8221;<br />
This is truly an amazing book that has so much value to players looking to further understand a concept that eludes many of us. Although I have technically &#8220;finished&#8221; the book, the theories and concepts are far from being fully integrated into my play. It is definitely is a book that I will be revisiting time and time again.</p>
