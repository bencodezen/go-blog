<h2 style="text-align: center;">Perceiving the Direction of Play</h2>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> In the first volume of The Heart of Go Series, Kobayashi Satoru 9P focuses on an important concept many players are unfamiliar with: the direction of play. As a critical component in any game, Satoru familiarizes the reader with direction of play though positions of his own games to illustrate direction of play in regards to fuseki, joseki, and fighting. This is an advanced book that should be read after one already has a basic understanding of direction of play.<br />

[expand title=&#8221;Before I Read This Book&#8230;&#8221; trigclass=&#8221;expandTitle&#8221;]
I got this book long ago, but I purchased this book because I felt that I was very lost when it came to choosing the direction of play. So while my ability to determine the direction of play has improved since then, I still feel rather skittish about my abilities to determine the correct direction of play and hope that this book will provide some guidance for me.<br />
[/expand]
[expand title=&#8221;My Review&#8221; trigclass=&#8221;expandTitle&#8221; expanded=&#8221;true&#8221;]
When I first started reading this book, I felt a little uneasy as I was hit with commentary that just felt way over my head. Fortunately though, that didn&#8217;t last too long. Once the commentary was finished, there were mini-sections that summarized Kobayashi Satoru 9P&#8217;s advice on the direction of joseki, fuseki, fighting, and so forth. Though not helpful for weaker players, they seem to be great reinforcement to players who already have a grasp on this topic.<br />
Fortunately, I could breathe a sigh of relief since the remainder of the book focused on utilizing a problem format. Being presented with a problem and then having its various options analyzed at least gave me a chance to comprehend something. Though by the time I finished the book, I can only say that I only made a small improvement in my overall ability with direction of play.<br />
As much as I would love to rain the book with accolades, I found the overall experience of the book to be laborious and not user-friendly. To start, it is not always clear which diagram is the correct answer to the problem. I know this sounds ridiculous, but there were numerous times where I read a diagram thinking it was the correct answer when it was not. The labelling was not consistent and it made for a confusing learning experience.<br />
In addition, the translation of the book is what I would label as &#8220;understandable if you work at it.&#8221; In other words, there are times when you have to pause and try to rearrange words or replace grammatical structures in hopes of trying to understand what is being said. Example: &#8220;White 1 leaves rights and interests on the right side&#8230;&#8221; Huh? In addition, the overall tone of the book is very matter of fact. This is great if you already have a strong foundation of go, but completely bewildering if you a weaker player trying to understand what is going on. Some might say that this is the nature of translated work, but I think that&#8217;s just a load of BS.<br />
So bottom line, I <em>do not</em> recommend this book for kyu players. Whole board thinking and direction of play is difficult as it is for kyu players, so it would a travesty if I let kyu players try and tackle this book only to be discouraged and have little to show for it at the end. It might be useful to dan players; but again, I cannot emphasize enough that the overall experience has a lot of room for improvement. You have been warned.<br />
[/expand]
[expand title=&#8221;Synopsis&#8221; trigclass=&#8221;expandTitle&#8221;]
<strong>What did I enjoy about the book?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The primary content of the book utilizes a problem format.</li>
<li>The problems are from real games which adds to its practicality.</li>
<li>Satoru always includes a diagram to show how the problem arose from game play.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What did I gain from reading this book?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A minor confident boost in direction of play.</li>
<li>A slightly better understanding of how to determine the direction of play.</li>
<li>Realization of just how little I know about direction of play.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What is the format of the book?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The first chapter consists of high level professional game commentary that I had a hard time following.</li>
<li>The rest of the content is structured as follows:
<ul>
<li>Diagram with directions on what you&#8217;re looking for.</li>
<li>A diagram that shows the course of the game and how the problem came about.</li>
<li>Usually about two to four variations and why they are wrong.</li>
<li>And somewhere in that mix is the correct answer.</li>
<li>A diagram or two with how the actual game proceeded afterwards.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What aspects can be improved on?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>My biggest complaint is that the correct answer is not always obvious. Sometimes it&#8217;s very clear since the diagram is labelled &#8220;The Correct Direction,&#8221; but there are numerous times where you have to sort out what&#8217;s right and what&#8217;s wrong. In fact, there were a couple times I thought the diagram I was reading was the correct answer when it was not actually so.</li>
<li>The translation is very terse. I recognize that there is are difficulties when it comes to translating since you want to keep as much of the language as authentic as possible, but it made it difficult to read or understand at times.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Is this book easy to read?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>No. Even though I&#8217;m a huge go enthusiast and English is my first language, I still found it rather laborious to work through this book. And to be clear, it&#8217;s not so much that the translation is difficult as a whole; but there are enough discreprancies here and there that it interferes with the overall experience of reading the book.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Bottom Line</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Appropriate for players who already have an understanding of direction of play.</li>
<li>Translation makes the overall experience of the book more difficult which reduces the value of the book to kyu players.</li>
<li>Recommended for dan players.</li>
</ol>

[expand title=&#8221;Recommended For&#8230;&#8221; trigclass=&#8221;expandTitle&#8221;]
<ul>
<li>Players who already have an understanding of direction of play.</li>
<li>Dan players who are not too concerned with explanations since the moves more or less speak for themselves.</li>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A couple days ago, I was doing some mitt work with my partner at the local boxing gym. About halfway into the round, I was getting visibly tired and close to exhaustion from trying to push beyond my limits. It was then though, that my partner said something that struck me:</p>
<blockquote><p>Remember to breathe. Control your breathing.</p></blockquote>
<p>Seems like such an obvious statement no? After all, don&#8217;t we all breathe subconsciously? Without breathing, we&#8217;d all be dead! What a stupid thing to say!<br />
If you think such crude and rudimentary thoughts though, you are missing the point. The fact is that while I might have been &#8220;breathing,&#8221; the fact is that I was so caught up in punching and keeping good form that I forgot to breathe half the time. You might exclaim, &#8220;How does one forget to breathe Ben? That&#8217;s ridiculous!&#8221; And you&#8217;re right to some extent, but instead of breathing more efficiently through my nose and exhaling through my mouth, I was holding my breath half the time (without even realizing it due to concentrating so hard on punching and maintaing form) and taking short gasps of air with my mouth in between. It&#8217;s no wonder that I was winded and at the point of near collapse before the round was even halfway through.<br />
So how does this relate to go?<br />
The reason I went to great lengths to explain breathing in boxing is because it occurred to me that a similar thing was happening to kyu players. Instead of breathing however, I would make the analogy that kyu players often players fail to play moves with the whole board in mind. Similar to breathing, it is a given that every move that is played affects the board in some way shape or form. However, if we just play moves without making a conscious effort to understand or give it a purpose in regard to the entire board, it is just as if we are going through the motions of punching without remembering to breathe properly. And then the next thing you know, you&#8217;re out of breath and your opponent cuts off a big group and delivers the knockout punch.<br />
Of course with time and experience, playing moves with respect to the entire board will be second nature; but while we still remain the weak kyu players that we are, we must be sure to make a conscious effort to take the entire board into consideration at all times. So to put my partner&#8217;s advice into another context:</p>
<blockquote><p>Remember to consider the board as a whole before playing your next move.</p></blockquote>

[expand title=&#8221;Before I Read This Book&#8230;&#8221; trigclass=&#8221;expandTitle&#8221;]
<strong>My Abilities</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Although I&#8217;ve had some exposure to joseki, I have avoided studying them like the plague. I really, really don&#8217;t like studying joseki.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>My Perspective</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Though I was skeptical of the book due to seeing the work joseki, I had heard a lot of good things about this book. In addition, since I was interested in trying to learn more about whole board thinking, I thought this book might be interesting to check out.</li>
</ul>
[/expand]
[expand title=&#8221;My Review&#8221; trigclass=&#8221;expandTitle&#8221; expanded=&#8221;true&#8221;]
<strong>What did I enjoy about the book?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The problems use a multiple choice format to help players like me who don&#8217;t know any joseki.</li>
<li>There are clear and easy to understand explanations for every answer choice that allows the reader to compare and contrast why the correct answer is better than the others.</li>
<li>The problems and solution diagrams are put on completely different pages to prevent the player from accidentally seeing the solution.</li>
<li>The layout of the book was very easy to read. Each section is clearly defined and the book is not cluttered at all.</li>
<li>Though the book seems to be centered on joseki, this seems more like a book on whole board thinking than anything else.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What did I gain from reading this book?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Improved understanding of how certain moves work with the board as a whole.</li>
<li>Reduction in kyu tunnel vision since I have more practice considering the whole board position.</li>
<li>Slightly better understanding of joseki patterns for the 3-4 point, low kakari.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What style of teaching does the book use?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Off the Cliff Style
<ul>
<li>There is no gradual progression into the material.</li>
<li>You learn through trial and error as you progress through the book.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Primary Learning Mechanism:
<ul>
<li>Multiple choice practice problems.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Other Learning Mechanisms:
<ul>
<li>Clear and concise explanations with an accompanying diagram to illustrate his point.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What aspect can be improved on?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>I wish there were more problems! =D But in all seriousness, this book is amazing as it stands. Top notch!</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Is this book easy to read?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Absolutely. The explanations are no longer than a paragraph long and are very clear and concise.</li>

<a title="Book Review: 38 Basic Joseki" href="//book-review-38-basic-joseki/">38 Basic Joseki</a>, like most joseki books, actually focuses on teaching the reader about the various sequences from joseki. There is some mention of how they affect the board as a whole, but there is a lack of illustration as to how it is truly impacted. Whole Board Thinking in Joseki, on the other hand, does a perfect job filling this gap.<br />

<strong>Description:</strong> Zeijst and Bozulich provide a foundation for the basic principles of moyos (frameworks of potential territories) with numerous examples from professional games. There are detailed analyses by top professionals along with whole-board problems for the reader to practice what was taught in the earlier chapters.

[expand title=&#8221;Before I Read This Book&#8230;&#8221; trigclass=&#8221;expandTitle&#8221;]
<strong>My Abilities</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>When it came to moyo (i.e. frameworks), I had one of two weapons in my arsenal: (1) Build the biggest framework possible and hopefully kill anything that comes inside. (2) Always invade my opponent&#8217;s framework and try to live. In the rare occasion that I thought to reduce the framework, the timing was usually off.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>My Perspective</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>By reading this book, I was hoping to gain a more balanced perspective on how to deal with and build moyos. Though I did not have a chance to preview the book, I was also hoping the teaching format would be a combination of explanations along with practice problems.</li>
</ul>
[/expand]
[expand title=&#8221;My Review&#8221; trigclass=&#8221;expandTitle&#8221; expanded=&#8221;true&#8221;]
<strong>What did I enjoy about the book?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>I really liked how they broke down attacking and defending moyos into 13 basic principles. Although it may be some time before they stick in my brain, I felt that the one line &#8220;proverbs&#8221; were very helpful.</li>
<li>The practice problems they provided were a great test of the principles that they introduced in the beginning of the book.</li>
<li>The explanations were very clear and usually provided an incorrect variation with an explanation of why it contradicted the 13 basic principles.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What did I gain from reading this book?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A better understanding of how to attack and defend moyos.</li>
<li>Greater confidence in dealing with my opponent&#8217;s moyos.</li>
<li>Inadvertently ended up getting a better understanding of whole board thinking since I have an improved ability to see moyos forming before it is way too late.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What style of teaching does the book use?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Multi-Pronged Approach
<ul>
<li>There are equal parts explanations, practice problems, along with game commentaries.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Learning Mechanisms
<ul>
<li>Explanations with example diagrams</li>
<li>Professional games with commentary</li>
<li>Practice problems</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What aspect can be improved on?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>I am happy to say that this book is great as it stands!</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Is this book easy to read?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Yes. The explanations are explained using laymen terms and are pretty short and straightforward.</li>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Overall Rating: 9 / 10 Ponnuki</h2>
<h3>Basic Information</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Title:</strong> Positional Judgment: High-Speed Game Analysis</li>
<li><strong><strong>Author: </strong></strong>Cho Chikun</li>
<li><strong>Publisher: </strong>Kiseido</li>
<li><strong>Publication Date: </strong>December 1989</li>
<li><strong><strong>Page Length:</strong> </strong>182 pages</li>
</ul>
<h3>Synopsis</h3>
<ul>
<li>A great book on positional judgment when it comes to whole board thinking.</li>
<li>Utilizes multiple choice questions along with example games to help illustrate his points.</li>
<li>Requires a basic level of endgame sequences for the estimations to make sense.</li>
<li>Appropriate for 6 kyu and stronger.</li>
<li>Recommended for serious players.</li>
</ul>
<p><span id="more-2926"></span></p>
<h3>What I Expected</h3>
<ul>
<li><span style="line-height: 13px;">A book that would teach me how to evaluate the board position when the borders are not so clear.</span></li>
<li>Lots of examples that would allow me to practice the concepts introduced in here.</li>
<li>To be able to start applying positional judgment (within a reasonable amount of error) to my own games.</li>
</ul>
<h3>What You Can Expect</h3>
<ul>
<li><span style="line-height: 13px;">A solid explanation on some theory behind estimating territory from three perspectives.</span></li>
<li>Quite a few problems to help test your ability to estimate territory.</li>
<li>A good number of examples that utilize multiple choice questions to test your knowledge and also comes with great explanations.</li>
<li>Two example games from Cho Chikun where he talks about his thought process during two title games.</li>
</ul>
<h3>My Thoughts as a 5 Kyu</h3>
<p>When I first heard of this book, the reviews online were rather mediocre and I was discouraged from purchasing it at the time. However, I am thankful that I finally did because I think that this book is underrated in terms of its ability to shed some light on a topic that I think many kyu players shun away from: accurately analyzing the positions on the board.<br />
Although I found the book to be rather enlightening, I will forewarn potential buyers who are unfamiliar with other basic strategic concepts of the game (e.g., what it means to attack, basic endgame sequences, etc.) will probably find this book rather challenging to grasp. Even though I&#8217;ve begun to apply some of those concepts to my games, I am the first to admit that it will require a lot more practice and probably another few passes before I understand the book entirely.<br />
If I were to critique one thing about the book, it&#8217;s that I would love more practice scenarios where I am forced to evaluate positions and see if my counting is accurate or not. Otherwise though, this book fills a much needed niche when it comes to players wanting to learn more about positional judgment.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the past, the go board was fragmented in my mind. Depending on the tide of the battle or how certain frameworks were developing, my brain would divide the board into various areas of focus. As a result, I very quickly lost sight of the bigger picture and had a difficult time figuring out what to do next or executing any particular strategy well. In fact, the only time I believe I was able to strategically dominate my opponent is when they jumped head first into a framework I was familiar in utilizing (e.g., the Chinese opening).<br />
To say that I&#8217;ve never experienced the zen of seeing the whole board at once would be untrue, but it wasn&#8217;t until my most recent lesson with frozensoul that I had a shocking awakening that would cause my world to dramatically shift. Games no longer seem like isolated battles that gradually add up to a greater theme. Instead, every move now seems to contribute to the entire picture.<br />
For those who are wondering, this mindset of true &#8220;whole board thinking&#8221; is rather taxing for me. It is far from being instinctively engraved in my brain. I still fall victim to kyu tunnel vision from time to time; but deep down, I can already tell that I have crossed into a new world where there is no turning back.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It&#8217;s funny sometimes, how everyone thinks that they can compartmentalize portions of their lives: work, school, family, relationship, friends, and hobbies. We reserve parts of ourselves to deal with the independent portions, yet we all have moments where one compartment overflows to another. This brings to question how realistic compartmentalizing everything is.<br />
The problems, the stress, and the conflicts we run into end up being nothing more than local battles. Fights destined to take place at the corner or sides of the board due to simple stone interactions. The commentaries that would come from each move exists in our world as well, &#8220;You did this wrong. How stupid could you be? Didn&#8217;t we discuss why you shouldn&#8217;t do this already? What were you thinking?&#8221;<br />
Eventually we all hit this point I&#8217;m feeling right now, where attempts at fusing everything into one solid mindset comes to a halt. Nothing looks clear, and you&#8217;ve lost sight of everything. I&#8217;m frustrated with the progress of things and can&#8217;t shake the irritation I have. It&#8217;s at this point that I think it&#8217;s time to take a sabbatical and get away from it all. I don&#8217;t mean to run away or go on vacation, but to simply take a step back from it all. Although many of us have our various aspects of our lives, the one thing for certain is that we cannot ignore our own personal goals. There&#8217;s a time limit for each and every one of us, and it would be disappointing for us not to give our lives the meaning we desire it to.<br />
I played a game of Go this morning. It was supposedly against an 18 kyu (there was a question mark), but I just couldn&#8217;t hold it together and resigned in the end. Everything seems to be clashing, and it&#8217;s probably time for me to take a step back from it all for now. After all, trying to compartmentalize our lives is anything but futile. Like the Go board, every play affects the whole board.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<figure id="attachment_863" style="width: 337px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-full wp-image-863" title="Priorities by xkcd" src="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2010/09/priorities.png?resize=337%2C276" alt="Priorities by xkcd" width="337" height="276" data-recalc-dims="1" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Priorities by xkcd</figcaption></figure>
So as someone who has officially left the comfort zone of school (I don&#8217;t consider grad school an umbrella to hide under anymore), one of the questions I&#8217;m hit the hardest with deals with whether or not I&#8217;m going to end up becoming a &#8220;Go junkie.&#8221;<br />
The deal is: I see Go as a pillar to understanding fundamental principles in life. It&#8217;s true. Go may not be the most ideal way to sustain yourself, but the life lessons that a person can derive from it is worth far more in my opinion. That is not to say that Go will be the sole focus of my life however. I&#8217;m going to job hunt, focus on spending time with people important to me, and expand other job-related skills since I&#8217;m hoping to open a business someday. Go is just something I view as critical to self-growth, so it does rank high in my priorities; but I won&#8217;t let it consume my life.<br />
For all those who are striving to live in reality right now, weigh your priorities as well. I am one of the most enthusiastic players that would encourage people using go as a tool to learning life lessons and self-improvement. However, if it gets to the point that it is damaging other portions of your life, it may be time where you ask yourself whether or not you are falling into the folly of focusing on the local battle of the board.<br />
Don&#8217;t forget that the Go board is often reflective of your life. Focusing on go alone while letting the rest of your framework go to hell will only come to haunt you later on. No different from trying to control a single corner while letting your opponent consume the rest of the board.</p>
