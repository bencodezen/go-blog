<h3>Detailed Review</h3>
<p><strong>Size &amp; Weight:</strong> The entire set is as light as a feather and easily fits in practically any bag (except possibly purses).  To further clarify, unless you have cargo pants that have massive pockets, this is not a set you can carry around with you in your pocket. And in all honesty, who wants to play on a board that is pocket size. Can you imagine how small the stones would be?!<br />
<strong>Dura­bil­ity:</strong> The entire set is made of plastic that should survive any normal wear and tear. Now granted, if a child decides to throw a tantrum and stomp all over it, I am pretty sure that your board will be demolished. In terms of the stones, you are far more likely to lose the stones before they ever break or crack. In addition, the magnetic board is adhered pretty well to the plastic; but any decent use of force will allow you to pull it off, so be careful.<br />
<strong>Usabil­ity:</strong> The overall design of the set is done well and quite pleasant to use. Due to the cost of the board however, it is to be expected that the stones are sometimes a little oddly shaped or cut slightly off. This doesn&#8217;t detract from the general usage, but can be a little aesthetically irritating to some people.<br />
Even though the set might come with a couple ill-shaped pieces with missing magnets, the value and quality of the board outmatches the price that you pay for it. Sure, there are many ways to improve the quality of the board; but I wouldn&#8217;t hold my breath for a portable go set with the quality and value of a true wood / stone go set. The purpose of this set is for recreational play during travel as opposed to serious play during tournament, so be sure to have the right expectations when you order this set.</p>

<h3>Detailed Review</h3>
<p><strong>Size &amp; Weight:</strong> Absolutely perfect. It&#8217;s small enough that it could fit in a backpack if you needed to. So unlike a real board and stones, it&#8217;s very easy to store away and doesn&#8217;t take up very much space. And in regards to the weight, it has enough weight to feel solid; but otherwise it&#8217;s super light and easy to carry.<br />
<strong>Dura­bil­ity:</strong> I&#8217;ve had this product for more than a year now and words cannot express how appreciate I am to have a product that holds up so well. The case is still great condition, and the stone bags have a little wear and tear but nothing major. In addition, the stones and board show some signs of use; but they are still working magnificently.<br />
<strong>Usabil­ity:</strong> Absolutely no complaints. The board flattens out with relative ease, and the stones* cling to the board rather well. (In one of the shots below, you&#8217;ll see that I have the board upside down and nothing falls off). In addition, putting everything back in the case is actually really easy. Since the bags that are carrying the stones are made with fabric, they conform to the shape of the case with a relative ease when you shake it a bit. And if you&#8217;re wondering about how the strap works in terms of slinging it over your back, it works fantastic.<br />
Considering how much this costs, this is honestly one of the best value items that exists on the entire go market. I could go on about how awesome this product is, but bottom line: unless you want a portable set made of actual stones and wood, this is hands down the best portable go set out there.<br />
<em>*Some people say that the stones are &#8220;too small,&#8221; but let&#8217;s be fair people, this is a portable set. If you want full sized stones, go and lug your stones and bowls. </em></p>

<h3>Detailed Review*</h3>
<p>When purchasing my first go set, this was by far the most anticipated piece of equipment. After all, the prospect of playing with real stones and making the aesthetic sound as you play each move was so exciting! However, I digress, here is what the package looked like when it came in. As with all other items I&#8217;ve received from <a href="http://www.ymimports.com/">Yellow Mountain Imports</a>, everything was packaged and protected very well.<br />

When you open the bag, here&#8217;s what you see.<br />

For those who are have never purchased yunzi before, they do not come all fresh and shiny when you receive them. The stones come with a white powder coat in order to protect from damage during shipment.<br />

Although it requires a bit of elbow grease and time to get them shined up and ready to go, I personally found the process very enjoyable and rewarding. It&#8217;s hard to say what it is exactly, but there&#8217;s just something about personally taking care of your stones that makes your stones that much more enjoyable to use. For those who are curious as to what the process is for cleaning yunzi stones, visit <a title="How to Oil Your Yunzi Stones" href="//how-to-oil-your-yunzi-stones/">my guide</a> for more information.<br />
<strong>Size &amp; Weight:</strong> The stones have a solid weight to them that gives a great feeling when picking each one up and placing it on the board. They fit very well on the Shin-Kaya Board that I purchased, but keep in mind that each  board is unique in what their max stone size is.<br />
<strong>Durability:</strong> I have not found durability to be an issue. Granted, I have not tried taking a sledgehammer to them, but I think it could survive anything short of that.<br />
<strong>Usability:</strong> This set is a fantastic all in one package. Great for leaving at home or bringing with you to the local coffee shop.<br />
If you&#8217;re in the market for biconvex stones, this is the set for you.** The bag carries the stones pretty well. The bowls are freaking awesome. And I love the feel of real stones in my hands. Though the price may seem a little high, you are buying a quality set that has so much value and will last a long time.<br />
*<em>Since most people are probably more interested in the stones, I have separated out the bowls and bag review to prevent the review from being overcluttered.

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Go Bowls and Stones Carrying Bag</h2>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Overall Rating: 8 / 10 Ponnuki</h2>
<h3>Important Notice</h3>
<p>This review is based on the bag that I received two years ago. Since then, <a href="http://www.ymimports.com/">YMImports</a> has upgraded the carrying bag to also include bowl straps as well. With that new feature, the bag&#8217;s review would escalate to a 9 or 10 Ponnuki status.</p>
<h3>Highlights</h3>
<ul>
<li>Best carrying bag for go stones and bowls that I&#8217;ve seen on the market.</li>
<li>The bag is made of durable material that hasn&#8217;t shown signs of ripping.</li>
<li>The handles are a little more fragile, so be a little more careful relying on those.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Product Details</h3>
<ul>
<li>Travel vinyl bag with two handles and a single zipper for the top.</li>
<li>Fits standard Go bowls up to 5&#8221; wide and 4&#8221; high</li>
</ul>
<p><span id="more-2375"></span></p>
<h3>Detailed Review</h3>
<p>In my constant search for better go equipment, this bag is one of the few that I&#8217;ve seen that combines the desired functionality of providing a travel case for your stones and bowls while looking great and at a fantastic price.<br />
<strong>Size &amp; Weight:</strong> The stones have a solid weight to them that gives a great feeling when picking each one up and placing it on the board. They fit very well on the Shin-Kaya Board that I purchased, but keep in mind that each  board is unique in what their max stone size is.<br />
<strong>Durability:</strong> I am not transporting my stones every day, but in the last two years I&#8217;ve used them, I have seen very little wear and tear. My only real critique is that the handles seem a little bit more flimsy that I would like. However, I really can&#8217;t speak for the handles since I rarely use them due to being paranoid for the safety of my bowls and stones; but on the few times that I&#8217;ve used them, they hold up quite well.<br />
<strong>Usability:</strong> In addition to its expected use as a carrying bag, it also functions really well as a protective case for your bowls and stones in the event you need to store them away for whatever reason.<br />
In all honesty, this is a purchase I consider mandatory for anyone looking to purchase go stones and bowls. You will not regret making this purchase (especially with the new updated bowl straps).</p>
