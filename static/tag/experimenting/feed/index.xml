				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 style="text-align: left;">Overview</h2>
<p>This week has been a continuation of trying to get used to the new training regimen that I started last week. Believe it or not, I have been rather successful at playing more instead of solely focusing on studying. So in that regard, things are a success.<br />
On the other hand, I lost again in my match this week for <a title="Yunguseng Dojang Official Website" href="http://www.yunguseng.com/">Yunguseng Dojang</a>. After some thought and introspection, I have come to the conclusion that my go has become very impatient lately. I try to complicate the game with every move while also experimenting with a territorial style that just ends up not working out for me. Sigh.<br />
Ah well. It has been fun experimenting with the territorial style. And who knows? Maybe this little detour of mine will help to patch up some of my weaknesses from my normal style. Guess we&#8217;ll have to see!</p>
<h2>Training Regimen</h2>
<ul>
<li>Spend about 50% of your time playing games.</li>
<li>Spend 10 minutes/day perusing a new book of go.</li>
<li>Spend 20 minutes/day diligently working on the Level Up series.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Games</h2>
<ul>
<li><a title="TygemGo Official Site" href="http://www.tygemgo.com/">Tygem</a> &#8211; 6 games</li>

<li><a title="KGS Website" href="http://www.gokgs.com/">KGS</a> &#8211;  3 games</li>

<li><a title="Online Go Server - BenGoZen's Profile" href="http://online-go.com/user/view/549/BenGoZen">OGS</a> &#8211; 3 ongoing games</li>

<li>The Theory and Practice of Semeai</li>
</ul>
<h2>Lessons Learned</h2>
<ul>
<li>Patience is an important value when playing go.</li>
<li>When you have an overwhelming advantage, (1) don&#8217;t become overconfident and (2) don&#8217;t give your opponent a chance to turn it around.</li>
</ul>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In case it hasn&#8217;t been obvious, lately my style has been a moyo style that emphasizes attacking and capturing groups to win. For today&#8217;s game, I am proud to announce my first deliberate attempt at playing a territorial style.<br />
In terms how I feel about territorial style, I have to say that it is a very draining method of playing for me. Ultimately, in my mind, territorial style boils down to cutting up your opponent&#8217;s territory and making pockets of live groups around the board to win.<br />
While this sounds like a rather straight-forward approach, it requires a lot of patience and calm reading in order to make sure that your opponent doesn&#8217;t succeed in capturing one of your groups (which would ultimately end in your loss). In addition, you have to try and make sure that you are maintaining a lead and not falling behind.<br />
<span id="more-1700"></span><br />
For my first attempt, I am happy with the results; but it&#8217;s clear that this is one of my weaker areas and will require some attention and work. Hope you enjoy the game!<br />
