<p>The next morning we woke up and headed off to get breakfast at a popular bagel place called Brooklyn Bagels.<br />

With our stomachs full of delicious bagel, we headed down to Brooklyn so that she could try Grimaldi’s.<br />
<figure id="attachment_5781" style="width: 600px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/10/2014GC-D06-02.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-5781" src="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/10/2014GC-D06-02.jpg?resize=600%2C800" alt="The famous Grimaldi's!" width="600" height="800" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">The famous Grimaldi&#8217;s!</figcaption></figure>
We got there before they opened, so we went by the harbor to take some pictures.<br />
<figure id="attachment_5782" style="width: 800px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/10/2014GC-D06-03.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-5782" src="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/10/2014GC-D06-03.jpg?resize=720%2C540" alt="Look at that weather!

After walking around a bit, it was time to get in line and eat our delicious pizza!<br />
<figure id="attachment_5783" style="width: 800px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/10/2014GC-D06-10.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-5783" src="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/10/2014GC-D06-10.jpg?resize=720%2C540" alt="Margarita pizza...

And with the weather so beautiful, we felt it would be a travesty to take the metro back, so we walked across the Brooklyn Bridge!<br />
<a href="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/10/2014GC-D06-12.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5784" src="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/10/2014GC-D06-12.jpg?resize=600%2C800" alt="2014GC-D06-12" width="600" height="800" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><br />
Before I knew it though, it was time for me to head back for my simul of the day against Francis Meyers, 1p. (At this point, I was trying to play as many different professionals as possible.) The following is the game record:<br />

<p>After my game finished, I went downstairs to help Myung and Dahye take more pictures of them while they were teaching another teacher seminar.<br />

When the class wrapped up, Myung had asked if I was available to eat dinner that night (which naturally I was). However, at the last minute he had to cancel because one of his student’s parents wanted to take him out to dinner. So I left to meet up with my girlfriend and try some great falafels and crepes!<br />
<figure id="attachment_5792" style="width: 800px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/10/2014GC-D06-44.jpg"><img class="wp-image-5792 size-full" src="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/10/2014GC-D06-44.jpg?resize=720%2C540" alt="2014GC-D06-44" width="720" height="540" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">This was from a place called Taim.

<figure id="attachment_5793" style="width: 800px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/10/2014GC-D06-46.jpg"><img class="wp-image-5793 size-full" src="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/10/2014GC-D06-46.jpg?resize=720%2C720" alt="2014GC-D06-46" width="720" height="720" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">This was from a place called Eight Turn Crepe which sold crepes that were into an ice cream cone shape and filled with deliciousness.</figcaption></figure>
By the time I got back to Hotel Pennsylvania, Myung and Jungsang were giving a game commentary on one of the games played by Andy Liu 1p.<br />
<a href="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/10/2014GC-D06-48.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5794" src="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/10/2014GC-D06-48.jpg?resize=720%2C480" alt="2014GC-D06-48" width="720" height="480" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><br />
<a href="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/10/2014GC-D06-54.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5795" src="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/10/2014GC-D06-54.jpg?resize=720%2C480" alt="2014GC-D06-54" width="720" height="480" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><br />
After taking a few pictures for them, I went to see where everyone was since I didn&#8217;t see anyone in the audience. And guess where I found my friends Nate and Diego?<br />
<figure id="attachment_5796" style="width: 800px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/10/2014GC-D06-77.jpg"><img class="wp-image-5796 size-full" src="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/10/2014GC-D06-77.jpg?resize=720%2C720" alt="2014GC-D06-77" width="720" height="720" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Promoted to the big league as game recorders!</figcaption></figure>
After watching the games for a bit, I walked out of the Master’s Tournament room, I turned to my right and who do I end up seeing?!<br />
<figure id="attachment_5797" style="width: 800px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/10/2014GC-D06-78.jpg"><img class="wp-image-5797 size-full" src="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/10/2014GC-D06-78.jpg?resize=720%2C540" alt="2014GC-D06-78" width="720" height="540" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">The amazing Anders and kyu-killer Keith going over one of this games!</figcaption></figure>
It was great to finally be able to meet Anders in person. I’m just sad I wasn’t able to hangout with him more! Oh well, at least I got the chance to meet the legendary Anders in person!</p>

<p class="p1">With the tournament officially off my mind, I have to admit it was kind of refreshing waking up without the worry of getting there at a specific time. I still got up a bit early though, as I wanted to run on over to sign up for simuls before the spots filled up. After all, since I wasn’t playing in the tournament anymore, I decided to set a new goal for myself: get as many simul games with professionals as possible!</p>
<p class="p1">After putting myself down for two games, my girlfriend and I went off to try a popular breakfast place: Clinton St. Baking Company. And while there was a decently long wait (considering it was a Thursday morning), it was definitely well worth it.</p>
<figure id="attachment_5734" style="width: 800px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/09/2014GC-D05-03.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-5734" src="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/09/2014GC-D05-03.jpg?resize=720%2C540" alt="Blueberry pancakes with maple butter syrup...

<figure id="attachment_5735" style="width: 800px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/09/2014GC-D05-04.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-5735" src="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/09/2014GC-D05-04.jpg?resize=720%2C540" alt="It was so good I had to put a second picture. Haha." width="720" height="540" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">It was so good I had to put a second picture. Haha.</figcaption></figure>
<p class="p1">By the time I got back to Congress, the match had already finished and people were getting ready for the pro events (i.e., lectures, game reviews, simuls, etc.). I would be playing Jennie Shen 2p, who was Michael’s teacher.</p>
<p class="p1"><span id="more-5732"></span></p>
<p class="p1">The following is the game record:</p>

<div id='glift_display2' style='height:500px; width:100%; position:relative;'></div>
<script type='text/javascript'>gliftWidget = glift.create({"divId":"glift_display2","sgf":"http:\/\/bengozen.com\/\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/09\/2014.08.14-US-Go-Congress-Jennie-Shen-2p.sgf","display":{"theme":"DEFAULT","drawBoardCoords":"1"}});</script>

<p class="p1">After the game was finished, I made a point to introduce myself to Jennie and told her that I was friends with Michael. Her face lit up with a smile as she recognized who I was referring to and we talked a bit before I excused myself since I didn’t want to take her away from the simul games any longer.</p>
<p class="p1">Since my game ended early, I went off with my camera to find Myung (9p), Jungsang (9p), and Dahye (4p) since they had essentially designated me their unofficial photographer for the Congress.</p>
<p class="p1">Here you can see Dahye providing game reviews to members of the audience who had questions about their own games.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/09/2014GC-D05-08.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5736" src="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/09/2014GC-D05-08.jpg?resize=720%2C480" alt="2014GC-D05-08" width="720" height="480" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">In the next few shots, Myung and Jungsang were giving a lecture on recent developments in joseki that was apparently for dan players. However, I have to say that their explanations were easy to understand and I didn’t feel out of place as I listened to them.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/09/2014GC-D05-20.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5738" src="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/09/2014GC-D05-20.jpg?resize=720%2C480" alt="2014GC-D05-20" width="720" height="480" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">One of cool things about the Korean pro events that I forgot to mention is that they were giving out all sorts of prizes.* This included things like go related souvenirs (i.e., the go dice I talked about earlier in the week, miniature go board with Hikaru and Sai on it, etc.).</p>
<p class="p1">*Just to clarify, I am not saying that the other professionals didn&#8217;t have their own form of prizes and such, it&#8217;s just that I can only vouch for the Korean pro events since I didn&#8217;t get the chance to attend any of the other ones.</p>

<p class="p1">After the lecture concluded, I went upstairs to my final simul of the day against Shirley Lin, 1p. The following is the game record:</p>

<p class="p1">After my game, I went to see what everyone was up to but had a difficult time locating anyone. So with no one to hangout with or any concrete plans, I took my girlfriend out to a vegetarian kosher place (which was absolutely amazing).</p>
<figure id="attachment_5740" style="width: 800px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/09/2014GC-D05-40.jpg"><img class="wp-image-5740 size-full" src="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/09/2014GC-D05-40.jpg?resize=720%2C540" alt="2014GC-D05-40" width="720" height="540" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">This was their black-eyed pea cake, which was a phenomenal appetizer.</figcaption></figure>

It was delicious!</figcaption></figure>
<p class="p1">After dinner though, my memory is a bit hazy as to whether anything else of significance happened that night. I vaguely remember going back to Congress to talk with Myung, but I can’t remember much else happening. Haha. Nonetheless, it was a fun day that consisted of good food and go!</p>

<p>Today was the official rest day for Congress. In other words, this meant that there would be no tournament matches so that people could go and explore New York if they wanted. As you might suspect though, there was a group of people who were here for go and just that alone. So in honor of these dedicated players, they had a “Die Hard Tournament” for these players.<br />
When I arrived at Hotel Pennsylvania, I found Nate and the gang hanging out.<br />
<a href="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/09/2014GC-D04-01.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5716" src="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/09/2014GC-D04-01.jpg?resize=720%2C540" alt="2014GC-D04-01" width="720" height="540" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><br />
<span id="more-5710"></span><br />
They seemed to have various plans for the day, so my brother and I decided to head out to try this soup dumpling place that he had been telling me about. Just as we were waiting for the metro to come however, I got a call from Myung inviting us for lunch. Doesn’t take a genius to guess what we did right? We hightailed it right out of the metro and went to meet up with Myung.<br />
When we arrived in Koreatown, we found Myung, Evan Cho (who was a strong amateur dan player that I had heard Myung talk about numerous times), and Mark Lee (who was another strong amateur from Korea). Both Evan and Mark were participating in the Master’s Tournament for Congress (which was reserved essentially for 5d and higher). So we talked a little about that and proceeded with the normal introductions and conversation.<br />
The food at the restaurant was traditional and authentic Korean food. And by that I mean we didn’t just eat Korean BBQ, but actual dishes that Korean people would normally eat at home or at a typical sit down restaurant. Apparently beef is pretty expensive in Korea. So while some of us would like to dream that every restaurant in Korea is just Korean BBQ, that is not the case. Haha.<br />
After finishing a delicious lunch, my brother and I planned go with Myung, Evan, and Mark one of the popular museums in New York (I can’t remember which); but after some time projections, we realized that we wouldn’t have time to go to the museum and also get my brother back in time to Penn Station. So we parted ways with them and headed off to let my brother get his things together.<br />
When the time came for him to leave, I have to admit I was a little sad to see my brother go. It might be some older brother instinct, but I had a great time hanging with him in NY and felt a little anxious watching him board the train on his own. I know I know… the guy is in his early 20’s, but I don’t think I’ll ever stop looking out for him. Haha.<br />
To get my mind off whether or not he’d be okay taking the train back on his own, I went back to Hotel Pennsylvania to see what everyone was up to. As I walked into the lobby, a little serendipity to have been in play because I ran into Michael as he was heading out. For those who don’t know, he was only able to stay for half the Congress, so I was really happy to be able to catch him before he left.<br />
<a href="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/09/2014GC-D04-02.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5717" src="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/09/2014GC-D04-02.jpg?resize=600%2C800" alt="2014GC-D04-02" width="600" height="800" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><br />
When I got to the top floor, I remember that I couldn’t really find anyone. It seemed everyone had headed off to do their own thing, so I sat down with my laptop and started working on some things. Sometime later, fellow UMBC alumni Nathan Epstein (henceforth referred to as Nathan and is not to be confused with Nate Eagle) came over to chat.<br />
In the midst of talking about the tournament and my withdrawal from the tournament, he pulled out this dice that he had gotten from one of the teaching seminars.<br />
<figure id="attachment_5719" style="width: 600px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/09/2014GC-D04-04.jpg"><img class="wp-image-5719 size-full" src="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/09/2014GC-D04-04.jpg?resize=600%2C800" alt="asdf" width="600" height="800" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">(Current side) One-space jump, (Bottom side) Large knight move, (Other sides) Small knight move, Diagonal, Two-space jump, Large diagonal move (i.e., elephant jump)</figcaption></figure>
Apparently this was a teaching apparatus for helping teach players about haengma (i.e., stone movement) and shape. So when he asked me if I wanted to try playing a game, I couldn’t refuse! For those who are wondering how this variant of go works, the rules are pretty simple:</p>
<ol>
<li>Start with a cross-fuseki formation with stones on the star points for both players.</li>
<li>Black goes first.</li>
<li>Player rolls the die.</li>
<li>Based on the haengma that shows up, you can use any stone of the board to move according to that haengma.</li>
<li>After player makes his move, the other player takes his turn.</li>
</ol>
<p>Though it took a little getting used to, I actually really enjoyed playing it and hope to play it again. And if anyone knows anyone selling those die, please be sure to let me know!<br />
After that fun game, I headed out for the remainder of the day since my girlfriend was arriving in town. And with that, the first half of Go Congress had come and gone. Tomorrow, the start of the second half of Go Congress!</p>

<p>When I woke up, I sat in silence for a while as I thought about what I was going to do. Although some would simply shrug off the forfeit and continue playing in the tournament, I couldn’t stand the idea of continuing in the tournament. And with my brother in town and my girlfriend coming up to visit the second half of the trip, my mind was made up.<br />
When I arrived at Hotel Pennsylvania, I went and officially withdrew myself from the tournament. I know that this decision might not sit well with some of you, but it was really the best decision for me as a whole. While it would have been great to have played in the tournament, withdrawing from the tournament freed up my schedule to spend time with my brother (and girlfriend eventually) while also allowing me the freedom to do whatever I wanted (i.e., spending time with professionals).<br />
Anyhow, I then entered the tournament room to see if anyone was up and around. As I walked around, I found Diego and Gurujeet in the middle of an intense game.<br />
<a href="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/09/2014GC-D03-01.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5689" src="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/09/2014GC-D03-01.jpg?resize=720%2C540" alt="2014GC-D03-01" width="720" height="540" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><br />
I vaguely remember catching Nate and Michael before the round started and wishing them the best of luck. And before I left, I went ahead and signed up for three simuls that day. After all, I could play in tournaments anytime I wanted back at home, it’s the professionals that made Congress as epic as it is.<br />
<span id="more-5682"></span><br />
After going to breakfast, I came back to play my first simul against Zhang Yu Hong, 5p.<br />
<a href="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/09/2014GC-D03-04.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5690" src="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/09/2014GC-D03-04.jpg?resize=600%2C800" alt="2014GC-D03-04" width="600" height="800" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><br />
The game record is as follows:<br />

<p>Shortly after finishing my simul, I got a call from Myung 9p asking me if I was free to help take pictures for him and Dahye 4p while they were teaching a class. Since the next simul was not for a while and I had finished my game early, I rushed off to help them take pictures.<br />
<a href="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/09/2014GC-D03-10.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5691" src="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/09/2014GC-D03-10.jpg?resize=720%2C480" alt="2014GC-D03-10" width="720" height="480" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><br />
Once the class was done, I headed up to the top floor (where the main convention was held). When I arrived, I ran into Michael who informed me that the store was now open. Words cannot describe how excited I was to go check the store out. After all, one of the major aspects of a convention is the store where you can spend your money on souvenirs and such!<br />
<figure id="attachment_5692" style="width: 800px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/09/2014GC-D03-28.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-5692" src="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/09/2014GC-D03-28.jpg?resize=720%2C540" alt="You can see Michael in this shot!" width="720" height="540" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">You can see Michael in this shot!</figcaption></figure>
It was like being a kid in the candy store. I seriously couldn’t believe my eyes as tables full of books were stretched across the room. There wasn’t as much go equipment as I would have liked to seen, but it was a respectable collection nonetheless. And on that note, they were selling autographed fans from professionals as well! Though memory isn’t serving me well at the moment, Michael purchased one of these fans. I can’t remember which professional it was, but I’m pretty sure he’ll be commenting below on which one he got whenever he sees this.* Nonetheless, it was great to see so much go merchandise in one place.<br />
<em>*Update: Michael got a Sakata Eio fan. Many thanks to Satoru for the reminder! I should&#8217;ve remembered! Haha.</em><br />
Once we were done browsing the shop, I can&#8217;t remember if this is precisely when it happened, but Michael and I finished our game from yesterday. The following is the game record:<br />

<p>After the game, I was scheduled for another simul and parted ways with Michael. I was slotted to play against another Chinese professional, Ding Bo, 5p. The following is the game record:<br />

<p>After the simul, I can’t really remember what I did; but I imagine it consisted of exploring New York city with my brother and trying more food. Towards the evening though, I came back to Hotel Pennsylvania to play my third and final simul of the day. Nate, Michael and Dalan were scheduled to play against one of the new Japanese professional, Francis Meyers, 1p. You can see them here in action!<br />

I had signed up to play against a Japanese professional as well, Deguchi Mariko, 1p. Satoru was on the waiting list, but fortunately the people who signed up didn’t show up and he was allowed to play.<br />

<p>After the game, I ran into Myung who asked me if I was up for getting food. Like he needed to ask. Haha. Jungsang hadn’t even yet however, so we waited for him to finish him simul game before heading out.<br />
<figure id="attachment_5701" style="width: 800px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/09/2014GC-D03-38.jpg"><img class="wp-image-5701 size-full" src="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/09/2014GC-D03-38.jpg?resize=720%2C540" alt="2014GC-D03-38" width="720" height="540" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">That guy stared at the board for so long trying to find a way to win&#8230; Let it go man.</figcaption></figure>
To keep a long story short, Jungsang’s simul game was an informal one he agreed to that took FOREVER. Seriously, the guy was playing to win and taking forever to make his moves. And when it comes to go etiquette, that’s extremely rude when you consider the fact that it is an informal game that also is a simul.<br />
While we waited, I went around and took pictures of the crazy go event that was going on on the other side of the room. Here you’ll see pictures of go in all shapes and sizes:<br />

After what seemed like forever, Myung, Jungsang and I were finally off to grab Shake Shack again. Haha. Except this time, we didn’t have the luxury of eating in since it was so crowded. So we brought the food back to Hotel Pennsylvania and holed up in one of the lecture rooms on the 6th floor.<br />
As we were sitting there and eating our delicious burgers, we talked about numerous things. Of course, as usual though, there were times where Jungsang wanted to say something more complicated and switched to Korean. And as I sat there listening to Myung and Jungsang talk, I came to a conclusion: I need to learn Korean. There’s just no getting around it. Haha. After all, with how invested I am in the go world and my increasing exposure to Korean professionals, it just didn’t make sense not to learn it.<br />
Anyhow, before long it was time for everyone to head off to bed and get some rest. And as I prepared to go to sleep, I couldn’t help but feel even more assured in my decision to withdraw from the tournament. After all, if I had participated in the tournament, I probably would have been too tired to play in all those simul games. And if I left early to find food, I wouldn’t have gotten a chance to hangout with Myung and Jungsang! No matter though, I had experienced the day fully and nodded off to sleep with no regrets.</p>

<p>The first official day of Go Congress! Woot! Needless to say, I was up bright and early and on my way to the hotel.<br />
The tournament was supposed to start around 9:00am, so I stopped by the hotel cafe to grab a quick breakfast (which ended up being a croissant and an orange juice) since I wanted to make sure I got there on time.<br />
When I arrived, the simuls and events were mostly filled; so I made a mental note to myself to aim to arrive earlier in the future if I wanted to get in a simul game.<br />
As everyone shuffled in, we all waited for the tournament pairings to be put up. And while we were all trying to relax and enjoy simply being at Go Congress, there was definitely a bit of anxiety throughout the air as this was our first match of the tournament. After all, everyone was hoping to start off the tournament with a win.<br />
Before we knew it though, we all went off on our separate ways to find our opponents. My opponent was an Asian girl named Kelly who was probably around fourth or fifth grade. After sitting down and setting up my iPad (for recording the game) and getting my headphones ready, we fiddled around with the clock for a bit to make sure we had the right time settings.<br />
<a href="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/09/2014GC-D01-01.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5648" src="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/09/2014GC-D01-01.jpg?resize=720%2C480" alt="2014GC-D01-01" width="720" height="480" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><br />
<span id="more-5647"></span><br />
It took us a little while to get it right, but we eventually did and started our game. I was pretty nervous since I hadn’t played in a competitive setting for quite some time, but I went ahead and gave it my best shot. The game record is below:<br />

<p>Though I lost, I have to say that overall I felt I played quite well. I made a drastic miscalculation toward the end that allowed her to destroy everything I had gained, but that is just a lesson learned for the future.<br />
With a loss under my belt, I went off to see how everyone else was doing. Nate was still in the middle of his game, so I went off and eventually found Satoru sitting off on his own. We sat down and talked about our respective games. Soon after, Michael and Nate came to join us and we showed our games to one another.<br />
<a href="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/09/2014GC-D01-08.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5649" src="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/09/2014GC-D01-08.jpg?resize=720%2C480" alt="2014GC-D01-08" width="720" height="480" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><br />
<a href="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/09/2014GC-D01-10.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5650" src="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/09/2014GC-D01-10.jpg?resize=720%2C480" alt="2014GC-D01-10" width="720" height="480" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><br />
As much as it was unfortunate at the time, it was rather funny that we all lost our first matches. And if I remember correctly, most (if not all) of the games were ones that we actually should have won. Haha.<br />
At this point of the day, it was about to be lunchtime; but most of the gang already had signed up for events or had something planned. Nate, for instance, had signed up for a simul with Andy Liu (1p). So I decided to go ahead and wait around to see what the turnout was like for the simuls.<br />
If you recall, at the Baduk Open Championship, I met a Korean professional by the name of Sohyun Park 4p. And though I was sad she wasn’t able to come to the Go Congress, her friend Dahye Lee 4p had come and was also bringing along something from Sohyun. So needless to say, I was excited to meet her friend!<br />
In lieu of all that, Dahye 4p was scheduled to have a simul around this time; so I was hoping to be able to catch her so I could introduce myself and possibly play with her.<br />
Upon introducing myself, her eyes lit up as she realized who I was and she greeted me warmly. I started out speaking in English, but I soon found out (to my surprise) that she actually spoke Chinese! Guess who also speaks Chinese? Hoorah!<br />
Once the introductions had been made, I asked her if I could play in the simul against her. My rationale at the time was that there were only 3 boards scheduled for the simul, so I figured a fourth wouldn’t hurt since it was more a teaching game than anything else. And sure enough, she was very gracious and allowed me to play.<br />

It had been a while since I last played a professional, but I remembered the feeling quite well and was intent on giving her everything I got. The game record is below:<br />

<div id='glift_display9' style='height:500px; width:100%; position:relative;'></div>

<p>Once I had resigned, Dahye (4p) was kind enough to spend time highlighting the important parts of the game and inform me when I had made mistakes. I was very grateful to have her spend time teaching me since the other simuls were still technically going on.<br />
As I was about to leave, she handed me a present and told me that we would arrange another time for me to get Sohyun gift. Needless to say I was beaming as I thanked her again for letting me play and teaching me.<br />
With my simul game finished, my brother and I went off to find Nate deep in thought against Andy (1p). Here are some shots of him in action:<br />
<a href="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/09/2014GC-D01-28.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5656" src="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/09/2014GC-D01-28.jpg?resize=720%2C480" alt="2014GC-D01-28" width="720" height="480" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><br />
<a href="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/09/2014GC-D01-38-e1411507839946.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5657" src="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/09/2014GC-D01-38-e1411507839946.jpg?resize=533%2C800" alt="2014GC-D01-38" width="533" height="800" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><br />
Apparently they ended up getting in a huge ko fight that allowed Nate to win the game. Congrats to Nate for winning against a professional!<br />
Once Nate finished his game and we all talked for a bit, my brother and I headed out to get lunch since I hadn’t eaten anything since like 8:30am and it was around 3pm at this time. Everyone else was planning on grabbing something quick since they wanted to catch other events going on (i.e., lectures, game reviews, etc.), so I headed out with my brother off to Brooklyn for some awesome pizza.<br />

By the time we got back to Congress, it was well into the evening. As I walked around, I had no idea where everyone was. Most of the events for the day had concluded, but there was a 13&#215;13 tournament going on. Sure enough, I managed to find nate and Michael entrenched in their games.<br />
<a href="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/09/2014GC-D01-42.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5659" src="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/09/2014GC-D01-42.jpg?resize=720%2C480" alt="2014GC-D01-42" width="720" height="480" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><br />
<a href="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/09/2014GC-D01-49.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5660" src="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/09/2014GC-D01-49.jpg?resize=720%2C480" alt="2014GC-D01-49" width="720" height="480" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><br />
Since I wasn’t participating, I stuck around to watch for a bit; but then I went off to see what sorts of random events were going on. Somewhere in the midst of that wandering though, I got a text from Myung (9p) asking me if I was up for getting a bite to eat. There was a burger place he wanted to try: Shake Shack. Without any hesitation, I told him I’d be happy to go with him; but I warned him that the lines would be decently long.<br />
We met in the lobby, but before we headed out, a friend of his was going to join us since he hadn’t eaten as well. Who was this friend? Jungsang Park (9p).<br />
As we walked to Shake Shack, I kept mostly to myself since Jungsang (9p) didn’t speak much English. So as you can imagine, it was mostly Myung (9p) and Jungsang talking to one another in Korean. To my utter surprise however, I found out that Jungsang actually spoke Chinese! And quite well in fact!<br />
So for the second time that day, my ability to speak Chinese allowed me to bridge a communication barrier with another Korean professional. You have no idea how thankful I was to my parents for making sure I learned it as a kid!<br />
<a href="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/09/2014GC-D01-51.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5661" src="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/09/2014GC-D01-51.jpg?resize=600%2C800" alt="2014GC-D01-51" width="600" height="800" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><br />
The line was long as predicted, but it was great to be able to hangout with Myung (9p) and Jungsang (9p). And to my relief, they were very happy with the food and felt that the wait was worth it.<br />
With our bellies full of delicious Shake Shack, we walked back to the hotel. As they were both tired, they went off to their rooms. I managed to find Nate and a few of the other guys hanging around. After some chit chat though, we were all getting tired so we headed off.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 style="text-align: left;">Overview</h2>
<p>This week has been focused on one thing: <strong>playing more games</strong>. As you&#8217;ll notice in my games section, I played a whopping 18 live games this week! And though I have been on an epic losing streak (with an occasional win to here and there), I can definitely feel the inexperience of being on the battlefield affect my play. Hopefully in time I will be losing due to actual mistakes instead of just playing moves on the board &#8220;just because.&#8221;<br />
Another milestone for this week is the official start of the <a title="Yunguseng Dojang Official Site" href="http://www.yunguseng.com/">Yunguseng Dojang</a>! The first official lecture was on Monday (May 5th) and it was on local techniques. Though I had heard of the techniques before (i.e., across attachment, break the dog&#8217;s face, and indirect defense), it was really great to have Inseong break down the different techniques while also showing where they appear within real games.<br />
I also played my first round as well last night. I ended up losing by time (because I was playing the game on a real board and lost track of time), but I felt that it was a game I wasn&#8217;t ashamed of. I tried a number of new things and tried to avoid any egregious errors. Of course, in the review, I got torn apart so it didn&#8217;t feel so great; but I think those are the kinds of lessons that tend to burn in your memory. Ah well. Next game I&#8217;ll do better!</p>
<h2>Training Regimen</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Spend about 50% of your time playing games</strong> &#8211; Though I haven&#8217;t measured this out with accuracy, I am simply trying to make sure that I play as much as I can. Believe it or not, I&#8217;ve started playing 10 minute games in order to ease up time pressure on myself. I used to hate this time setting, but I&#8217;m starting to gain a new appreciation for it. More on this when I&#8217;ve solidified my position on it.</li>
<li><strong>Spend 10 minutes/day perusing a new book of go</strong> &#8211; I happen to have a lot of books that I own but haven&#8217;t read, so I created this new task in order to allow me to actually go through all the books that I own. I know it&#8217;s not quite the same as studying, but it&#8217;s fun for me and plus it&#8217;ll allow me to put more book reviews up in the future.</li>
<li><strong>Spend 20 minutes/day focusing on one topic of go</strong> &#8211; I&#8217;ve noticed that my attention span for a particular subject is super volatile these days. One day I&#8217;m interested in positional judgment, and the next day I&#8217;m curious about joseki. So instead of binding myself down to the same book (which gets boring for me), I devised this task in order to allow for topic changes while still giving myself adequate time to really study and absorb one topic per day. Lectures also can be used in place of books as well.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Games*</h2>
<ul>
<li><a title="KGS Website" href="http://www.gokgs.com/">KGS</a> &#8211;  6 games</li>
<li><a title="TygemGo Official Site" href="http://www.tygemgo.com/">Tygem</a> &#8211; 20+ games</li>
<li><a title="GoPanda IGS Official Site" href="http://pandanet-igs.com/communities/gopanda">IGS</a> &#8211; 5+ game</li>
<li><a title="Dragon Go Server - BenGoZen's Profile" href="http://www.dragongoserver.net/userinfo.php?uid=60385">DGS</a> &#8211; 5 ongoing games</li>
<li><a title="Online Go Server - BenGoZen's Profile" href="http://online-go.com/user/view/549/BenGoZen">OGS</a> &#8211;  3 ongoing games</li>
</ul>
<p><em>*I&#8217;m probably going to need a new structure for doing this. I&#8217;m starting to play a lot more now and it&#8217;s getting hard to track the exact number of games I&#8217;ve been playing. Do you think it&#8217;s useful that I keep specific metrics? Or is there something better I can do. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated!</em></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 style="text-align: left;">Overview</h2>
<p>As many of you know, I spent the past weekend at the <a title="1st Washington Open Baduk Championship — Part I" href="//1st-washington-open-baduk-championship-part/">1st Washington Baduk Open Championship</a> and have been therefore swamped with trying to make sure I took the time to write the posts before too much time had passed. It was an eye-opening experience that has given me an opportunity to really change my perspectives on how I&#8217;ve been approaching go. Especially after talking with Myung (9p) with some of his thoughts, I definitely am looking to make some changes to my training regimen.<br />
The only other thing that&#8217;s worth mentioning is that I am officially making a move away from KGS to either WBaduk or Tygem (depending on whichever I can get running on my Mac). It&#8217;s not that I won&#8217;t be logged in anymore or will refuse to play on it, but I&#8217;ll be reserving KGS for playing with friends and anyone who asks me for a game. Otherwise, my focus on playing &#8220;ranked games&#8221; will be moving to the Korean servers. More on that to come when I have a well formulated thought as to why I&#8217;m doing this. Till next week!</p>
