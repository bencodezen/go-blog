				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>As this is my first week back since my vacation, it has been a relatively light week that has consisted of me trying to get my feet wet again in the world of go. Like I mentioned before in a previous post, I&#8217;m working on hard on really gaining a better understanding of what I&#8217;m capable of maintaining consistently without burnout.<br />
Playing ranked games has been a little weird and disappointing since I can&#8217;t seem to hold my own at the moment, but I&#8217;m trying not to let it bother me too much since I am a bit rusty and loss through very clear and obvious mistakes. So as long as I work hard to become more disciplined about how I play each move, my games should improve without much effort.</p>
<h2>Games</h2>
<ul>
<li><span style="line-height: 13px;">KGS &#8211; 6 games ( 2 wins : 4 losses )</span></li>
<li>DGS &#8211; 2 ongoing games</li>
<li>Nova &#8211; 4 ongoing games</li>
</ul>
<h2>Training</h2>
<ul>
<li><span style="line-height: 13px;">20 tsumego problems each day.</span></li>
<li>Worked on <em>Mastering the Basics: 501 Tesuji Problems</em>.</li>
<li>Started on <em>Mastering the Basics: The Basics of Go Strategy</em>.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Lessons Learned</h2>
<ol>
<li>Avoid blitz games and games 25 minutes or less since I am a thinker. Fast games will come when my fundamentals are more solid.</li>
<li>Really need to stop the bad habit of &#8220;Let&#8217;s play here and see what happens.&#8221;</li>
<li>Got to keep working on thinking of games as if I&#8217;m playing myself.</li>
</ol>
