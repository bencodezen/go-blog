				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 id="weeklygowednesdayissue45" style="text-align: center;">Weekly Go Wednesday, Issue #45</h2>
<h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>
<p>Introducing go to new people is a topic that I’m very passionate about and it’s something that I think a lot of people mess up. To be fair, it’s not their fault and they are not intentionally doing so. It’s just that people don’t realize how the lack or presence of certain teaching principles can have profoundly different results.<br />
I come from the belief that one day go will be known by the masses and played by all kinds of people. I don’t believe that it is a game for “smart” people and have no intention of seeing it get shelved as a niche of a game that only “intellectuals” play. Everything you’re about to read comes from personal experience and/or things that I have actually witnessed in real life, so there’s nothing theoretical about it. In addition, I have to emphasize that this “manifesto” focuses on people brand new to go. More established players are not considered below.<br />
With that said, let’s dive right into it shall we?<br />
<span id="more-5541"></span></p>
<h3 id="principle1:youarenotteachinggo.">Principle #1: You are not teaching go.</h3>
<p>Wait what? Isn’t this whole article about how to “teach” go? In one sense it is, but you’ll also notice that I put the team “teach” in quotes because I think it puts people in a completely incorrect mindset.<br />
When a person tries to teach something, I have found that they are always very quick to correct a person’s mistake. Once they get it in their heads that they are “teaching,” there is this sense of superiority and a desire to raise the “perfect student.”<br />
What do I mean by “perfect student?” Well what’s the ideal situation for introducing a new person to go? Easy. They become hooked and become obsessed with the game the way many of us are. However, the reality of it is that people of this mentality are far and few between.<br />
What most people often forget is that go is simply a game to most people. Like chess, checkers, or video games, it is just one way to pass the time and enjoy themselves. It is not something that they obsess over and try to improve at the way most of us do. As a result, the mindset needs to be completely different for these people.<br />
Teaching go is reserved for trying to help a player gain another stone in rank. This is not what you are doing. You are simply trying to help someone learn the rules of go and be able to play a game on their own. It doesn’t matter if their moves are great, or whether or not they make mistakes, they simply need to be able to play and you will have accomplished your goal.<br />
To put it another way, imagine that board games are like restaurants in a food court and the prospective customers’ appetites are their free time and energy. When a person comes into the food court looking to figure out where to eat, do you think that they are going to eat a three course meal at all the restaurants to figure out where they want to eat? Absolutely not! They wouldn’t have the stomach for it!<br />
So what’s the solution? The sample of course. You offer samples to all prospective customers because having them simply take the time to actually try your product is what you really need. If they like it, they’ll come in and enjoy all your restaurant has to offer. Or maybe they can’t sit down today, but because the sample you offered was great, they’ll come back another time. And worst case scenario, they don’t care much for it; but even in this scenario, at least they know what your food is and can tell people what it is.<br />
As a result, your goal is not to “teach” go; but to instead market and sell it to anyone willing to give you their time and attention. You are not a teacher. You are a go enthusiast who wants to share with everyone why go is awesome and why they should play it. And the way you are going to do that is not by teaching them the game, but by introducing the rules to them in a fun and easy way.</p>
<h3 id="principle2:keepitsimplestupidk.i.s.s..">Principle #2: Keep it simple stupid (K.I.S.S.).</h3>
<p>Whenever anyone is learning anything new, the most important thing is that they get to practice, practice, and practice. So what does that mean for us as we show them the ropes of how to play go? Stop trying to introduce new and advanced concepts when they’ve barely grasped how go works.<br />
Case and point. Let’s say you’ve just finished teaching someone how to capture stones. You ask them if they understand and they nod. At this point, you might feel compelled to the launch into this lengthy explanation about life and death or ko works; but don’t do it! That is one of the absolute worst things you could possibly do.<br />
You have to realize that thinking you understand something is WAY different than applying it. I cannot even count the number of times where the player told me that they “understood” what I had just explained but had a difficult time actually applying it in the game. For example, once we start playing first capture, the board will get slightly complicated, and if I ask them to identify which group they are able to capture with one move, they get confused and can’t find the group! This is by no means their fault, but it illustrates the point I’m trying to make in that it’s easy to think they grasped a concept when in fact they really haven’t.<br />
So I have a basic rule to follow, avoid the following topics when explaining the game or playing with a new player:</p>
<ol>
<li>Suicide</li>
<li>Ko</li>
<li>Life and Death</li>
<li>Tesujis</li>
<li>Komi</li>
<li>Shape Efficiency (like why empty triangles are bad)</li>
</ol>
<p>This sounds crazy to full-fledged go players, but I have seen countless beginners who play full games on a 9&#215;9 board without ever questioning those things. They delight and find joy in simply being able to play and apply what they just learned. After all, isn’t it much easier to play a game when there aren’t a bunch of exceptions to remember? Go has one of the simplest rulesets needed to start playing, so why complicate that?<br />
And to top it off, exceptions (like suicide and ko) are much easier to remember when they are discovered by the players themselves. There have been plenty of times when I was playing with a new player when they would stop me and go, “Wait a second. What about this?” In that case, by all means teach it to them! After all, if they are thinking at that level, it means they have grasped the other material which is great! Otherwise, let them practice with the simple ruleset as much as they want. After all, you want them to remember how to play the game the next day right?</p>
<h3 id="principle3.givethemasmanyopportunitiesforsuccessaspossible.">Principle #3. Give them as many opportunities for success as possible.</h3>
<p>When I had a chance to take a break from teaching last Saturday, I saw a classic scenario occurring on a number of the boards throughout the table: the new player was getting demolished and the person “teaching” had a bunch of stones as prisoners. I could only shake my head as my mind screamed, “Are you trying to discourage him from playing go?!?!”<br />
I understand that there are some players who relish in getting crushed and see it as a challenge, but I <strong><em>guarantee</em></strong> you that most people you will be introducing the game to will <strong><em>not</em></strong> be like this at all. In fact, even something as simple as not grasping the rules is often reason enough for most people to walk away from learning a game. So imagine what it would be like if you are struggling to grasp the rules and getting destroyed at the same time. I don’t know about you, but I probably wouldn’t be playing this game any time soon. And that is precisely what we <strong>don’t</strong> want.<br />
If you take a moment and think about successful games or apps, they tend to share one common functionality: they have really intuitive tutorials that make it very easy to go through because each level of accomplishment is often as simple as a touch or a swipe on your screen. In other words, they make it fun for someone to pick up the basics so that they can easily transition into the more advanced features later on.<br />
In the same spirit, I strongly believe that go should be taught in the same manner. People respond well when they feel like they are accomplishing something or doing well at something. As a result, it is critical that they are given as many opportunities as possible to feel that way. By doing so, you will improve the chances that they will actually remember how to play the game the next day and maybe even share it with others one day.</p>
<h3 id="mybasiccurriculumforbrandnewplayers">My Basic Curriculum for Brand New Players</h3>
<p>Of course, some of you are wondering how I introduce new players to the game. While I’m still working out the kinks and plan to eventually release a detailed curriculum, here’s the general outline:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Start with the absolute basics of the game.</strong> Use other games that most people are familiar with to start differentiating the most basic rules of go. For example, in chess and checkers, you place pieces in the square. In go, we put the pieces on the intersections.</li>
<li><strong>Explain the concept of liberties and give them plenty of opportunity of practice for counting the liberties of stones.</strong> This is a really easy way to give them opportunities for accomplishing things and feeling like they are making progress.</li>
<li><strong>If time permits, I give them practice scenarios for capturing stones to further reinforce the idea of liberties and capturing.</strong> So you would make a shape with your stones and surround it except for it’s last liberty, and then have the person play the correct move to capture the group.</li>
<li><strong>We play a couple games of first capture on a 9&#215;9 board.</strong> (1) I refrain from using any tesujis and constantly leave weaknesses open for the new player to spot. (2) I constantly let them undo and encourage it in fact. (3) My goal is not to win, but to give them continuous opportunities to practice and reinforce what we just learned.</li>
<li><strong>If they are still interested in taking the next step in learning about go, then that’s when I explain the concept of territory and its importance in determining how one wins or loses in go.</strong> People often have trouble understanding this part, but I make the analogy of war and two parties coming to sign a peace treaty and they usually understand.</li>
<li><strong>Finally, I give them either 6–9 stones handicap (on a 9&#215;9 board) depending on how fast they grasped the other concepts and play with them.</strong> Yes, the handicap is ridiculous, but it doesn’t matter because I’m not trying to win. I simply want them to play. If they are playing and spending more time on the game, I’m accomplished my goal.</li>
</ol>
<p>And just to reiterate from Principle #2, I avoid all the exceptions to the rules (like ko, suicide, etc.) and nuances unless the player asks me about it or it naturally occurs in a game. But for the most part, I avoid letting situations like ko arise for the sheer fact that I want the player spending as much time soaking up and reinforcing the basic rules of go as long as I possibly can.</p>
<h3 id="otheradvicefrommyexperience">Other Advice from My Experience</h3>
<ol>
<li><strong>Don’t kill any big groups</strong>. If you’re playing a 9&#215;9 board game and you notice that a group only has one eye, don’t try to kill it. In fact, you should actually try to play in a way that makes him live without him realizing it.</li>
<li><strong>If the score is going to end up in the negative points, you better be the one with the negative score.</strong> As an experienced go player, you should not take any pleasure in crushing a new player and leaving them with negative points. In fact, you should feel ashamed if you let the game become that way. If anyone should have negative points, let it be you.</li>
<li><strong>Even if a group only has one eye at the end of the game (9&#215;9), I just let it live and count the points.</strong> This is probably hard for a lot of players to do, but I honestly see no value in pointing out that their group is dead. New players won’t know that you let it slide and it prevents them from feeling like they suffered a humiliating defeat. And to be honest, once you’re done showing how the game ends and score is counted, you are usually moving on to the next game. So what’s the point?</li>
</ol>
<p>So to end this long rant, at the end of the day, you have to remember this key fact: people have no obligation to learn, play, or even remember what the game of go is. It doesn’t matter if they never get ranked or never play on a 19&#215;19 board. If you can get them to remember what the game is and vaguely how to play it, you’ve already done an immense service to the go community. And maybe, just maybe, one day we will live in a world where people will stop coming up to me and ask if I’m playing othello.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Over the weekend, in the midst of my slump, I decided to step back and take a hard look at what I had been doing and what I had to show for it. And though many of you might think otherwise, I realized that I was far behind the pack when it came to what I had accomplished so far.<br />
Upon that realization, I decided it was time to take a sledgehammer the systems and processes that I’ve been using over these past few years. As a result, I invested a lot of time, energy, and money into getting myself back on track. After all, people out there changing the world have the same hours that I do during the day, so it was time for me to make a change so that I could join the ranks of those hyper-productive people.<br />
What does this have to do with go? Well, as many of you know, running this blog consumes a lot of time and energy. And though it would be awesome if this were my full time job, I have many other things in my life that I need to attend to as well (i.e., my job, my girlfriend, friends, family, etc.). On top of all that, let’s not forget that I am also trying to get stronger at the same time as well! So when it comes down to it, the more inefficient I am at using my time, the more sporadic my results will be when it comes to things like my go abilities or the quality of the posts on my blog.<br />
And though I hate to admit it, I’ve hit a roadblock with go. In reality, it probably is a multi-faceted problem that has to do with the rest of my life; but I’m not too worried about it since I think the changes I’m making will help me overcome that roadblock in time.<br />
Being that today being the first day of July, it’s only appropriate that this mark of a fresh and new beginning. After all, weaknesses are simply opportunities to get stronger. So with that said, time to get to work.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Lately I&#8217;ve been reconsidering what direction the blog has been heading in. Although it&#8217;s been great starting a new series and having content flow consistently, lately the blog has felt more like a newspaper or e-magazine of sorts instead of a personal journal. For example, the game reviews that are being published are now usually like a month behind where I am now, which can be confusing for you as a reader and also throws my blog into a weird clashing timeline.<br />
As a result, I&#8217;ve been thinking a lot about what I can do to fix that, and I&#8217;ve come up with the following items in order to better optimize my time and produce content that better fits my vision for the blog:<br />
Starting next week&#8230;</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Thursday Go Tygem will now be discontinued</strong> in order to pave way for #2 and #3.</li>
<li><strong>Monday Go Meditation is going to undergo a reboot</strong> with an updated format that takes some elements of Thursday Go Tygem and should improve the overall quality and value of the weekly column. In addition, I will be clearing out the queue in Monday Go Meditation in order to make way for current games and realign the blog with the games I&#8217;m currently playing as opposed to games I played weeks or even months ago.</li>
<li><strong>There will be a new post every weekday (i.e. Mon-Fri)</strong>. This might seem extreme and be a point of concern for some, but I&#8217;ve reached a new level of comfort with my blogging that should make this very viable. I&#8217;m hoping that this should help the blog start to return to its origins of being a chronicle of my journey (in real-time).</li>
</ol>
<p>In addition, you&#8217;ll start noticing little changes around the blog like new tagging or categories appear as I restructure the content in order to make it more user friendly, but those shouldn&#8217;t impact your reading experience on the blog much.<br />
Starting in July&#8230;</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>I&#8217;m going to update the format and change the schedule of Friday Go Forward </strong>&#8211; Although some don&#8217;t realize it, Friday Go Forward currently captures my progress from the last Friday afternoon/evening to the next Thursday evening since it gets published every Friday morning. In order to better capture my weekly progress, I will be changing it to Saturday so it fully captures that week. In addition, everyone&#8217;s feedback  was really helpful on figuring out next steps, so be on the lookout in the future for an improved format!</li>
</ol>
<p>Whew. Been meaning to unload that from my brain for some time. I&#8217;m hoping that you&#8217;ll like these new changes; but as always, please be sure to leave feedback in case I&#8217;m missing something or you see something I can do to improve what you&#8217;re seeing here on the blog. See you around!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 style="text-align: center;">Weekly Go Wednesday, Issue #40</h2>
<p>Recently I have found myself exploring a lot of new ideas and concepts from varying schools of go. A simple example of this is my inability to stick with reviewing one style of go at a time. For example, last week I was very motivated to finally purchase <a href="http://www.slateandshell.com/SSYZ009.html#sthash.z3luFkAt.dpuf">Master Play: The Territorial Styles of Kitani &amp; Cho Chikun</a> and find out what it really meant to have a &#8220;territorial style.&#8221; It was a fascinating and eye opening read; but once I had read most of the book within a few hours, I was suddenly driven to go back and study <a title="Book Review: The Fighting Styles of Kato Masao and Seo Bong Soo" href="//book-review-fighting-styles-kato-masao-seo-bong-soo/">Master Play: The Fighting Styles of Kato Masao &amp; Seo Bong Soo</a> as well! Talk about opposing styles!<br />
As you might expect, my games have also started to undergo a change as well. I find myself trying all sorts of weird and new things lately because of all these new ideas floating around my head. So as I was perusing for ideas to write for this week&#8217;s Weekly Go Wednesday, the following quotation from Pablo Picasso inspired me to write this post:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;I am always doing that which I cannot do in order that I may learn how to do it.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p><span id="more-4520"></span><br />
With my interests being all over the place, it really does feel as if I am undergoing some sort of transformation in my go. Stones seem to move and speak to me differently as I play games now. Maybe it&#8217;s just the mere fact that I am playing more. Hard to say, but what I will say is true is that Picasso&#8217;s quotation is at the heart of my games lately.<br />
Whenever an opportunity arises to try something new, I rarely hesitate to try it in my games anymore. There is far less concern for winning and/or fear of losing than I used to have in the past. So games have felt more like laboratory experiments as of late. Sometimes I&#8217;ve thought to play super tight territorial moves to try and mimic Kitani, and then other times I&#8217;ll intentionally abandon a group the way Seo Bong Soo would do so in order to draw the game into a complicated battle between multiple groups.*<br />
<em>*This is not to be confused with turning the game into one giant capturing race or killing one huge dragon. Instead it is more along the lines of the back and forth of fighting between multiple groups that results in territory being gained or trades being made in exchange for different parts of the board. In other words, true fighting and not one gigantic field of bloodshed. </em><br />
By doing this, I have felt like I have started taking steps forward in deepening my understanding of my own go. Instead of simply sticking to what I know, exploring new territory and ideas in my own games has been incredibly rewarding in not only my growth as a player, but my appreciation for the game as well.<br />
The best example of this is my recent study of the &#8220;territorial style.&#8221; While I have always known of this style, I would have to say that I had little to no appreciation for it up until recently. It&#8217;s not  that I looked down on the style or had any disrespect for it, but I always scoffed at the idea of ever playing that way since I was always interested in &#8220;fighting&#8221; or &#8220;attacking&#8221; (both of which are concepts I actually never really understood either).<br />
Yet, with my curiosity of late, letting myself learn about the territorial style of go has really done wonders to the way I approach the game. I have even tried using it myself in some of my games with some success and even enjoyed it! And I never would have thought of it this way, but gaining insight into the &#8220;territorial style&#8221; is really opening me up to start really figuring out where my style of go is. And though I thought I had it all figured out, I realized my style is still a molten hot ingot of steel waiting to be forged to the perfect sword. (But this is another topic in itself, so let&#8217;s save that for another time.)<br />
At the end of the day, I think what I&#8217;m trying to say is don&#8217;t let yourself be confined to any one perspective. More often than we&#8217;d like to admit, the only way for us to further our progress is to do things that we are uncomfortable with. And by doing so, we not only gain valuable insight into ideas and concept that transform our minds, but also an irreplaceable experience that will only add to the complex tapestry that is our life.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A couple days ago, I suffered a rather one handed defeat that was a rather rude awakening. Not only did I lose convincingly, but I made three very critical misreads during the game that sealed the deal. Needless to say, it was rather dishearteningly en you consider how much time I&#8217;ve put into my studying.<br />
Of course, with a shock like that, it is only natural that I took some time to really evaluate how I have been studying. Though my reading productivity has been rather impressive to some, it is no surprise that I have ended up sacrificed accuracy in end. My reading speed is rather quick, but the lack of discipline when it comes to reading alternate variations or considering the fact that my opponent might just flat out ignore me is not taken into consideration when I&#8217;m actually playing. As a result, I have thought about different ways to approach my training.<br />
So far, what I have decided that I need to switch from a task based productivity to a time based productivity. What does that mean exactly? Well, instead of trying to complete say 300 problems a day, I will instead devote a full 20 minutes to practicing problems. How ever many I finish is completely irrelevant, but I will hopefully be able to focus more on the accuracy and discipline of my reading this way. In addition, this will hopefully help me manage my time better and prevent me from throwing my life out of balance.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.nova.gs/">Nova Go Server</a></h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Here are 10 reasons why you should join me and play on Nova Go Server!</p>
<ol>
<li><span style="line-height: 13px;"><strong>It&#8217;s a turn-based AND real time go server.</strong> So in the event both players are online, you can play moves and chat as if you were on the live go server. And then, if anyone has to leave, no problem! It becomes turn-based go just like that!</span></li>
<li><strong>It updates in real time!!!!!</strong> I don&#8217;t know about any of you, but the worst thing for me on Dragon Go Server is the fact that when both players are online at the same time, you have to keep refreshing the page in anticipation of the next move. So with Nova Go Server, I can just leave the kifu open and it&#8217;ll automatically updated whenever my opponent plays a move.</li>
<li><strong>It is a web based app!</strong> That means no downloading or installing while getting a crisp and clean interface.</li>
<li><strong>It has features that Dragon Go Server lacks.</strong> Example: Planning conditional moves so that you can save moves that you know you will play in the event your opponent plays X.</li>
<li><strong>You can login using social media.</strong> Although a small benefit, it&#8217;s nice being able to login with my Twitter account instead of having to manage another go server account. (And FYI, for anyone looking to play with me, you can find me under my usual username: bengozen).</li>
<li><strong>It&#8217;s actively being developed!</strong> This means that the technology and features are still being updated and you can actually look forward to seeing actual updates!</li>
<li><strong>The user interface is so much cleaner!!</strong> You have a notifications button on top that updates real time, a sleek modern menu on the top for easy navigation, great user interface for how to play moves or access certain features&#8230;. THIS IS SO EXCITING!!!!!!!</li>
<li><strong>There is a spectator chat window!</strong> So people can come in and kibitz on your game for your review when the game is over! (This is something I miss when it comes to turn based go on Dragon Go Server).</li>
<li><strong>They even offer a Malkovich Log!</strong> This is not a feature I&#8217;ve ever used, but I know it&#8217;s really popular so another kudos to them!</li>
<li><strong>Oh yeah, did I mention that IT&#8217;S FREE!!!!!!!!!! </strong></li>
</ol>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">&#8216;Nuff said.</h2>
