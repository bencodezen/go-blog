<p style="text-align: left;">I recently had the pleasure of discussing a game with frozensoul and DeepSnow, when DeepSnow said something that made me laugh:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;I count on kyu players to outread themselves.&#8221; &#8211; DeepSnow</p></blockquote>
<p>While it was funny at the moment, it didn&#8217;t take long before the truth of the statement dawned on me.<br />
For those wondering what he is talking about, DeepSnow is referring to the tendency of kyu players to automatically play conservative moves in anticipation of some crazy tesuji (even though it doesn&#8217;t exist).<br />
There are two primary reasons for why players do this:<br />
<span id="more-1691"></span><br />
<strong>#1. They have had a traumatic experience where something they thought worked gets demolished by a stronger player.</strong><br />
You have to realize that <em><strong>every</strong></em> player knows what this feels like. It sucks when it happens to you, but I am sure that there has been more than one occasion where you played a move that was not supposed to work but getting away with it with a big smile on your face. And to be honest, it&#8217;s not so much that our original move was flawed; but our inability to properly punish a bad play ends up getting us in trouble. The simplest example would be someone accidentally dying in a life and death situation when they were supposed to live. Therefore, the way to combat that is not to lose any edge on the moves that you play, but to put more thought into the possible follow-up moves so that there is nothing to regret at the end of the game.<br />
<strong>#2. The fact that their opponent has a higher rank makes them assume that their opponent&#8217;s reading is better.</strong><br />
Here&#8217;s the thing though, just because your opponent has a higher rank than you doesn&#8217;t mean that their reading is that much more miraculous than yours. In fact, stronger players often make overplays that can lead to their utter demise if the correct response is given. On top of that, they often play these kinds of moves in anticipation of you playing a sub-optimal move in response so that they can gain momentum. Unfortunately, we often let them get away with these overplays for fear of getting into a fight with them and losing big.<br />
So when you are playing against stronger players, keep the following in mind:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Play moves that you understand.</strong> In other words, you should be have an idea as to how you see the follow-ups playing out. You should never feel pressured to play &#8220;higher level moves&#8221; since you are playing a stronger player. Sticking with what you understand will allow you to learn from your mistakes and grow instead of being like, &#8220;Well that was a move that just looked right.&#8221;</li>
<li><strong>Only get into fights that you believe you can win.</strong> Do not cut and fight because you don&#8217;t know what else to do. Getting cut up into multiple weak groups is precisely what your opponent wants. It&#8217;s not that you shouldn&#8217;t fight, but you should definitely pick your battles carefully.</li>
<li><strong>Most importantly of all, your opponent is human too.</strong> Regardless of how strong your opponent is, they are not perfect and are capable of making mistakes as well. In fact, keeping a cool head and a calm approach could be the edge you need to take them by surprise.</li>
</ol>
<p>Hope that this advice helps to keep your head on a little straighter the next time you play a stronger opponent. And if there&#8217;s anything that you&#8217;ve found that helps you when playing against stronger players, please be sure to share!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 style="text-align: center"><em>Weekly Go Wednesday, Issue #14</em></h2>
<p><a href="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2013/01/wgw14.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1723" alt="Proofreading Credit to TitanWebMarketingSolutoins" src="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2013/01/wgw14.jpg?resize=300%2C235" width="300" height="235" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><br />
While nothing can replace the experience of playing games, one of the greatest mistakes that players make is to play games endlessly without any mind as to why they are winning or losing. There is nothing wrong with this approach as a whole, but it is contrary to the whole notion of getting stronger. After all, how can anyone learn from their mistake if they never knew it existed?<br />
The one thing we have to remember as kyu players is that we often fall victim to being ignorant to fundamental go principles. It&#8217;s not so much that we&#8217;re not aware of them, but applying them in our game is a completely different story. Often times in the middle of a game, we will think one way and will not realize our mistake till later on. As a result, an extremely important aspect of getting stronger is to review your games.<br />
<span id="more-1717"></span><br />
Here is an overall guideline (in order of level of effort) as to how you should approach your game reviews:<br />
<strong>#1. Start by reviewing the game on your own (or with a friend).</strong><br />
Casually go through the game and see what things you might have done differently, or how you think the game might have gone if you had responded differently. The important thing to remember is not to spend a lot of time going over the game, but to go over any mistakes you&#8217;ve made and learn from it as best as you possibly can. This is the absolute bare minimum you should do after each game.<br />
<strong>#2. Get a stronger player to review your game (preferably at least 3 stones stronger than you).</strong><br />
Stronger players fulfill the gap that we lack when it comes to understanding why certain things work and certain things don&#8217;t. In fact, it is their guidance that helps bring us back from the edge of self-delusion when one of our &#8220;brilliant tesujis&#8221; turns out to be easily countered by a different response. So make no mistake, this type of review can do wonders for your understanding of the game.<br />
<strong>#3. Come prepared to a game review with a stronger player (again, preferably at least 3 stones stronger).</strong><br />
If you want to get the most out of your reviews, come to a review prepared to with the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Pick three moves that you are really proud of.</li>
<li>Pick three moves that you were not sure about.</li>
<li>Pick three moves that you thought were bad in hindsight.</li>
</ol>
<p>By doing this, you will be doing yourself a huge favor since your reviewer will have a clear insight into how you are thinking. In addition, this will allow the reviewer to easily tailor the lessons towards your habits and style of play instead of making it generic.<br />
So yes. While <a title="Even Games with Stronger Players" href="//even-games-with-stronger-players/">last week&#8217;s Weekly Go Wednesday</a> focused on how playing against stronger players against stronger players is a good method for getting stronger, the game reviews that come afterwards can make the difference between feeling awful about yourself and having your eyes opened to brand new possibilities.</p>
