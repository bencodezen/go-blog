				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I just finished my second round of Yunguseng Dojang. As the title of the post states explicitly, it was another sound defeat to be added to my battle staff of go.<br />
On one hand, I want to make myself feel better by telling myself that I played well. On the other hand though, I also was playing completely out of my style this game as well.<br />
I don&#8217;t know why it is, but lately I&#8217;ve been trying really hard to use the territorial style as White. And then on top of that, I&#8217;ve been hell bent on making the game as complicated as possible from the start. So that ends up putting me in experimental territory that I&#8217;m completely unfamiliar with.<br />
Do I wish I would have managed to win my second round? Yeah. Feeling a bit crummy at the moment. Hopefully the review will shed some light on my mistakes. Ah well. Off to bed I go.</p>
