				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Over the last couple of days, I&#8217;ve been doing a bit of self-reflection. Amidst the thinking and introspection, one of the things that I realized was that I had a really inconsistent approach to my games. Although I didn&#8217;t realize it at the time, I often found myself trying to play a game for the heck of it or to try and fit in a quick win before I needed to do something else. Then, on the complete opposite end, there were times when I played games where time was not a factor and I could completely immerse myself in my games. As one might expect,Â this made a significant impact on the results of my games.<br />
While time is clearly one of the aspects that impacted my games, I realized that more blame can be attributed to my attitude toward the games. After all, a number of my ranked games were played with the idea that, &#8220;I can beat stronger players in even games, so this game should take only a fraction of the time and energy.&#8221; Unbelievably cocky no? Way to completely overrate myself and not respect my opponents for the strength they possessed.<br />
I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;ll write more on this in the future, but I think it&#8217;s important that you give every opponent the respect they deserve. Trying to complicate a game in order to utilize your strong reading abilities to win is very different from underestimating your opponent and expecting them to make poor decisions. After all, I think a lot of us can agree that losing a game because you underestimate your opponent feels pretty crappy.<br />
So while I&#8217;ve been a little quiet in terms of playing games, it&#8217;s not because I&#8217;m taking a break from go; but I&#8217;ve decided that I want to give every game I play the attention that it deserves. I&#8217;ve been rather busy as of late, but I&#8217;m trying my best not to play a game just to satisfy an itch. After all, I want every game I play to be a game I am proud to call my own, regardless of whether I win or lose.</p>
