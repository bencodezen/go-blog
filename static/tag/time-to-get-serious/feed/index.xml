<h2 style="text-align: center;"><strong>APRIL FOOLS!!!!! xD</strong></h2>
<p>To be honest, I had no intentions of pranking anyone or anything; but then I started drafting a post for today and then the idea just came to me. So&#8230; *bursts of laughing* you&#8217;ll have to forgive me for trolling you a little bit. (By the way, got to love that GIF. Captures how I&#8217;m feeling perfectly. Cracks me up.)<br />
Anyways&#8230; on a more serious note, today marks the beginning of April and thus a chance to start fresh as the official countdown to <a title="Go Congress Official Site" href="http://www.gocongress.org/">Go Congress</a> begins. Yup&#8230; I&#8217;ve registered. I haven&#8217;t paid yet since I want to make sure that nothing on the schedule alters my plans, but it&#8217;s practically set in stone.<br />
Since this is my first Go Congress, I&#8217;m really hoping to go there with a bang. In order to really reinvigorate my training in preparation for Go Congress, I&#8217;ve started:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Re-watching <a title="Hikaru no Go Wikipedia " href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hikaru_no_Go">Hikaru No Go</a> </strong>&#8211; It&#8217;s always good to start back with one of the most inspiring stories of all go stories.</li>
<li> <strong>Joined <a title="Yunguseng Dojang Official Site" href="http://www.yunguseng.com/">Yunguseng Dojang</a> </strong>&#8211; This is essentially an online insei program (from what I understand). My friend Diego has told me good things about it, so I&#8217;ve decided to give it a shot!</li>
<li><strong>Becoming super-disciplined about my tsumego training</strong> &#8211; In my last few games I&#8217;ve played on KGS, I&#8217;ve been reminded just how important reading is and how it can completely change the tide of the game when you&#8217;re able to read just one step further than your opponent.</li>
<li><strong>Working a lot harder on the blog</strong> &#8211; I know this might seem totally unrelated to my growth. And to some, it&#8217;ll hinder my progress as a player. However, the blog is something that I&#8217;ve come to really enjoy and has helped me be accountable for my own journey as a go player. Definitely do not regret any of the time I&#8217;ve spent on it!</li>
</ol>
<p>With that said, I also wanted to give a quick shoutout to <a title="Maaike's Twitter" href="https://twitter.com/My8ke">Maaike</a> and her <a title="Maaike's April Challenge Post" href="http://thegochallenge.blogspot.com/2014/04/april-challenge.html?utm_source=twitterfeed&amp;utm_medium=twitter">April Challenge</a>! Her April Challenge is to &#8220;get our of your comfort zone.&#8221; So, for this month, <strong>my challenge will be to play a territorial style and avoid a moyo style!</strong> I think that should be a good one right? (If you have a better one for me, please let me know!)<br />
Hope you all are doing well and don&#8217;t get pranked too much today!<br />
<em>PS. I haven&#8217;t forgotten about my Hong Kong posts. They are just taking a lot longer than anticipated.</em><br />
<em>PPS. One last thing, I&#8217;ll be releasing another combo review with frozensoul on the third jubango game next Wednesday (4/9), so be sure to be on a lookout for it!</em></p>
