[expand title=&#8221;My Review&#8221; trigclass=&#8221;expandTitle&#8221; expanded=&#8221;true&#8221;]
I continue to be impressed with Yilun Yang&#8217;s ability to take concepts that most strong players take for granted they understand and break it down for weaker players like myself who often make fundamental strategic errors such as choosing the proper pincer. Like any other book I&#8217;ve read, applying it to my own game will take some time; but the sheer fact that I was able to understand his main point the first time around is extremely commendable on his part. Finally, Yilun Yang does a great job simplifying the two primary styles of go: territorial vs. moyo and explaining how one should properly play if one is to choose one or the other. Definitely worth checking out if you&#8217;re confused about any of the topics covered in this book!<br />
