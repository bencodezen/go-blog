<figure id="attachment_5198" style="width: 500px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/washingbadukopenpart2-01.png"><img class=" wp-image-5198" alt="washingbadukopenpart2-01" src="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/washingbadukopenpart2-01.png?resize=500%2C375" width="500" height="375" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Hikaru No Go, Kuwabara Hon’inbo (Epsiode 29)</figcaption></figure>
When I woke up the next day, I felt like a brand new person. I know that I could have been like a lot of other players who would have recalled the performance from the first day and felt sorry for themselves, but the the experience I had watching Park Sohyun (3p) play the night before had struck me and really opened my eyes.<br />
I was running a little late that morning, and ended up getting there around 9:35am. According to the schedule, I was already late and so I half-expected to find everyone already playing their games and my clock already running. However, it seemed like I wasn&#8217;t the only one running late because the pairings hadn&#8217;t even been put up when I arrived.<br />
After catching up with some people though, the roster was finally put up. As I scanned the list, I found my opponent: a 5 kyu. He would be taking Black and I was giving him no handicap.<br />
My opponent was 5 kyu and I wasn&#8217;t giving him a handicap. Had it been yesterday, I probably would have been frustrated that I was &#8220;demoted;&#8221; but I was past those stupid egotistical thoughts today.<br />
As I sat down in front of my opponent, I was very clear on what I was going to do: I was going to try and play like Sohyun did the night before. It was going to be strong and interesting go. That&#8217;s the go I would play. Below is the kifu. (The commentary version will be Monday Go Meditation: Game 63)<br />

<p style="text-align: left;">It was an exciting game, but one that I felt far more in control of than any of the games previously. When my opponent resigned, I let out a sigh of relief. &#8220;Yes.&#8221; I thought, &#8220;At least I&#8217;m now 2-2. And to top it off, I&#8217;m feeling a hell of a lot better than yesterday.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">After Round 4, Myung Wan Kim (9p) and I grabbed our bento boxes (unfortunately I didn&#8217;t take a photo this time, but I got the <a title="Galbi Wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galbi">galbi</a> one) and I took him back to the hotel so he could rest / work on other things (since there was a few hours gap before he had to be back).</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">When I dropped him off, he asked me to pick him up around 3:10pm. So when I arrived back at the tournament, I looked at the time.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">&#8220;1:00pm is when Round 5 starts,&#8221; I thought, &#8220;And assuming my game takes even just the main time alone, I would be over time and late picking up Myung.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">With my record at 2-2, I seriously debated not playing in the 5th round and taking a buy. After all, 2-2 isn&#8217;t a bad record to end the tournament with right?</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">A good part of this was my insecurity at the prospects of possibly ending the tournament with a record of 2-3 and losing the final round, but I realized quickly that it was stupid. I decided to simply play in the 5th Round, and if push came to shove, I would resign the game if it took too long because I wanted to make sure I would pick up Myung on time.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Before I knew it, the fifth round pairings were up. My opponent was a 4 kyu that I knew from the area. There would be no handicap and I was taking white. Below are the results of the my final game for the tournament. (The commentary version will be Monday Go Meditation: Game 64)</p>

<p>When the game was coming close to the end, time was also drawing near as well. It was around 2:30pm when I had begun my final hunt to kill the group on the top; but my opponent still had plenty of time left on his clock, so I couldn&#8217;t fault him for trying to take the time to make sure he was really dead. However, with time drawing close, I began mentally preparing myself to resign and simply be satisfied with the game that I had played.<br />
As you might imagine, I breathed a sigh of relief and thanked my lucky stars when he resigned. &#8220;Hoorah!&#8221; I thought, &#8221; I still can go pickup Myung with time to spare!&#8221; And with that, I went to report my results and went off to pick him up.<br />
When we got back, there was still some time to spare before the remaining festivities began (i.e., lecture and simul games). This was perfect however, because  I was able to spend some time talking with Sohyun (since she had been running in and out and busy with other obligations). We went over my game in Round 5, and I even got her to sign a book that she had given me the night before.<br />
<figure id="attachment_5206" style="width: 358px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/haengmaBook.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-5206" alt="haengmaBook" src="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/haengmaBook-768x1024.jpg?resize=358%2C477" width="358" height="477" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">It&#8217;s a Korean book on haengma (i.e., stone movement). Best souvenir from the event!</figcaption></figure>
As we wrapped up one of our conversations, a fellow Korean player had come by; so she had the idea to give both of us a simul game while we were waiting for everything to start (which was incredibly kind of her). I decided to play an even game with her since I wanted to feel the full power of her skills.<br />
Unfortunately we were only able to play about 20 or so moves before she was summoned to play the official simul games scheduled for the event. However, what I will say about the game was that even in that series of short exchanges, it was quite an experience to watch her start dismantling what I thought was a good position.<br />
With all the games finished, they had the following activities going on simultaneously:<br />
(1) Myung Wan Kim (9p) reviewing one of Andy Liu&#8217;s (1p) game from the tournament.<br />

So many people participating!</figcaption></figure>
After a couple of hours, the time finally came for the awards ceremony.<br />
The tournament was broken up into seven sections:</p>
<ol>
<li><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">Open Section (7d+)</span></li>
<li><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">Dan A (4-6d)</span></li>
<li><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">Dan B (1-3d)</span></li>
<li><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">Kyu A (1-5k)</span></li>
<li><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">Kyu B (6-10k)</span></li>
<li><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">Kyu C (11-15k)</span></li>
<li><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">Kyu D (16k+)</span></li>
</ol>
<p>When they announced the first place prize for the Kyu D division, &#8220;&#8230; 1st Place, trophy and $100&#8221; echoed over the microphone. As I heard the cash prize amount, I&#8217;d be lying if I said that part of me didn&#8217;t feel just a twinge of jealously as I heard the cash prize amount. After all, it wasn&#8217;t chump change by any stretch of the means!<br />
As I sat there listening to them announce the winners, I recalled the time that I had won first place in the <a title="NOVA Pumpkin Classic Tournament 2012 — Conclusion" href="//nova-pumpkin-classic-tournament-2012-conclusion/">Pumpkin Classic</a>. I smiled as I remembered that momentous feeling. And a small part of me wished that I had done better in the tournament; but then I reminded myself that I had nothing to be ashamed of for this tournament. After all, on top managing to bring my record up to 3-2, the experiences and the lessons that I had learned through this tournament were priceless and I would not have traded it in for a better record or any trophy or prize money.<br />
&#8220;Kyu A Division (1-5k),&#8221; echoed over the microphone.<br />
My attention returned to the present as I thought.  &#8220;Oo&#8230; I wonder who won my division.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>&#8212; let&#8217;s pause and let&#8217;s rewind the clock for a sec &#8212;</em></p>
<p>Earlier when I had been walking around, I had heard the tournament directors talking about how the kyu divisions did not have any people who won 4 games except for one person. (I later found out it was Bob Crites who had been performing well in tournaments recently.)<br />
A part of me became hopeful at that thought that maybe I was still in the running for something, but then I brushed the notion aside as I recalled that I had not exactly played my best consistently in the tournament.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>&#8212; return to present moment &#8212;</em></p>
<p>&#8220;3rd Place &#8211; Weixin Wang, 4k &#8211; $50 and a trophy&#8221;<br />
*applause and multiple cameras taking photos going off*<br />
&#8220;Huh,&#8221; I thought, &#8220;That&#8217;s the guy I lost to in the 3rd round. If he got third place, then I&#8217;m most definitely out of the running now.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;2nd Place &#8211; John Zhao, 3k &#8211; $100 and a trophy&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Wait,&#8221; I thought, &#8220;That&#8217;s the guy I beat in the 1st round. Maybe I still have a shot?&#8221;<br />
As I&#8217;m sitting there bewildered and trying to make sense of how the tiebreakers might actually work, the microphone echoes again:<br />
&#8220;1st Place &#8211; Benjamin Hong&#8230;&#8221;<br />
<figure id="attachment_5208" style="width: 347px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/05/omgcat.gif"><img class="size-full wp-image-5208" alt="Wait... What?! *turns around to see if I'm not the only one who heard that*" src="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/05/omgcat.gif?resize=347%2C225" width="347" height="225" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Wait&#8230; What?! *turns around to confirm that I&#8217;m not the only one who heard that*</figcaption></figure>
I honestly wish someone had taken a picture of my face, because I can tell you that I was completely and utterly surprised. But yeah, I wasn&#8217;t hallucinating or imaging things. I really did get 1st place.<br />
<figure style="width: 448px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/05/2014-WOpen-22.jpg"><img class=" " alt="2014-WOpen-22" src="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/05/2014-WOpen-22.jpg?resize=448%2C298" width="448" height="298" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">There&#8217;s my first prize envelope. The cash prize was $200!</figcaption></figure>
<figure id="attachment_5209" style="width: 467px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/05/2014-WOpen-21.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-5209  " alt="2014-WOpen-21" src="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/05/2014-WOpen-21.jpg?resize=467%2C700" width="467" height="700" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Here&#8217;s the trophy I got as well. Looks pretty sweet!</figcaption></figure>
The thing about tournaments is that you never know what&#8217;s going to happen. I went the first day with a 1-2 record and completely thought I was out of the running. In fact, I even thought about dropping out the last round because of stupid insecurities. Imagine if I had done that? Imagine if I had just given up? The story would not have been nearly as exciting would it?<br />
Though I am very grateful that I got 1st place, I really believe that this tournament will forever go down as one of the pinnacle moments in my journey as a go player. The experiences and things that I learned about myself through the trials and tribulations are ones that I will forever remember fondly and I look forward to continue building on them.<br />
Many thanks also goes out to Keith, Gary, Andy, Todd, Alan, the Korean Baduk Association and many others for making this tournament a huge success. And of course, special thanks goes out to <a title="SmartGo Official Site" href="https://www.smartgo.com/">SmartGo</a> for its awesome iPad app that serves as my trusty sidekick for recording my games.<br />
Finally, a huge thanks goes out to Myung Wan Kim (9p) and Park Sohyun (3p) for making this tournament an unforgettable experience and providing guidance when I really needed it!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center;"><a title="1st Washington Open Baduk Championship — Part I" href="//1st-washington-open-baduk-championship-part/">Part I</a> &#8211; <strong>Interlude</strong> &#8211; <a title="1st Washington Open Baduk Championship — Part II" href="//1st-washington-open-baduk-championship-part-ii/">Part II</a></p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Weekly Go Wednesday, Issue #38</h2>
<p>Though some of you may hate me for delaying Part II of my <a title="1st Washington Open Baduk Championship — Part I" href="//1st-washington-open-baduk-championship-part/">1st Washington Open Baduk Championship</a> series, the funny thing is that the Weekly Go Wednesday series actually fits in perfectly with the story. So hold your horses for one more day, and let&#8217;s dive right into this shall we?<br />
So where were we? Ah yes. I had finished off the <a title="1st Washington Open Baduk Championship — Part I" href="//1st-washington-open-baduk-championship-part/">first day of the tournament</a> with the second to worst record you can have: 1 win with 2 loss. To compound on that embarrassment, I won one and then proceeded to lose each game afterwards with each being a more epic failure than the last. After all, it would have been way better if I had lost the first two games and then won the last one. Then at least I could feel like I improved over the day instead of the epic plummet that actually happened.<br />
Usually when I undergo a shocking disappointment like I did that day, my first reaction is to try and figure out what went wrong. After all, it wasn&#8217;t as if some freak accident happened where I hallucinated and put the stones in the wrong place. No, especially with go, there are no such things. So for the rest of the day, I kept thinking about what went wrong. Many things crossed my mind&#8230;<br />
<span id="more-5141"></span><br />
The first (and most self-pitying) of my thoughts was the simple fact that I wasn&#8217;t actually 3 kyu. KGS and the AGA might have ranked me as 3 kyu, but maybe the statistics were biased and overly generous since I did not play often enough to get an accurate measurement of my strength. So perhaps I was really more like 4-5 kyu when it came to the competitive scene. But after trying to entertain that thought a bit longer, even I realized how absurd that notion was.<br />
Since that wasn&#8217;t it, the next thing that I came up with was the fact that I lacked the stamina to survive tournaments. In other words, I might be able to play one serious game a day and then a few casual ones; but in a tournament setting with all the pressure and intensity, I ran out of steam and could barely win one game. After all, I had stopped playing ranked games (aka serious games with strangers) and was probably more out of practice than I was willing to admit at the time.<br />
Okay. That made sense, but I concluded that it could not be the only reason. After all, being tired doesn&#8217;t explain the self-destruction that occurred as the day went on. After all, it&#8217;s not as if I just made a few bad reading mistakes, it&#8217;s like my brain decided to take a vacation and I was playing like a mad man. So there must be more&#8230;<br />
Ah. Could a part of it be arrogance from the fact that the last full tournament I played in (<a title="NOVA Pumpkin Classic Tournament 2012 — Introduction" href="//nova-pumpkin-class-2012-intro/">NOVA Pumpkin Classic</a>) resulted in me have a perfect record and getting 1st place? And in hindsight, I had not really prepared for that tournament, so perhaps I subconsciously thought that this tournament might be similar. Maybe I could just wing it and do well like last time. Not necessarily win, but at least do well. You know?<br />
<span style="line-height: 1.5em;">Well, that was about how far I got with my introspection when I arrived in a nearby conference room to see Park Sohyun (3p) playing a teaching game with one of the VIPs.*</span><br />
<em>*To give some background on this story though, the VIP she was playing a teaching game with was actually an insei when he was younger. So while he was older now and out of practice, there was no doubt in my mind that he was pretty strong (i.e., he only took 2 stones for the game).</em><br />
<figure id="attachment_5164" style="width: 420px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014-WOpen-10.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-5164" alt="2014-WOpen-10" src="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014-WOpen-10.jpg?resize=420%2C560" width="420" height="560" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">I didn&#8217;t want to take a picture of her from the front at this time because I didn&#8217;t get a chance to ask if it would be okay and she was in a middle of the game.</figcaption></figure>
They would play for like 30-40 moves, and then he would have a question for her and they would rewind the game back like 20 moves or clear off an area of the board to talk about a particular sequence or concept. And then the game would resume another 30-40 moves before the same thing happened again.<br />
I could not understand anything they were talking about since they spoke in Korean. However,as I watched the game unfold, I would watch as her moves exuded with power as they came down on the board. And at the same time, I watched as the VIP tried his best to hold his ground against her while ending up with this very over concentrated groups that she would harass while continuing to gain a greater advantage on the board with each move.<br />
The weird thing is that it&#8217;s not as if I had never met a professional or seen a professional play against an amateur before. Yet for some reason, her moves captivated me in a way I had never quite felt before. As I watched in awe, each and every move came flowing down with a grace and beauty that I can only describe as surreal.<br />

<p style="text-align: center;"><a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014-WOpen-01.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-5155" alt="2014-WOpen-01" src="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014-WOpen-01.jpg?resize=576%2C247" width="576" height="247" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Hey everyone! Welcome to Part I of my awesome experience at the 1st Washington Open Baduk Championship this past weekend! Though many of you already know the results of the tournament, I&#8217;ll start by asking you all to refrain from commenting on the actual result till Part II since some don&#8217;t know yet.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">In addition, I&#8217;m sure that many of you are eager to see what kind of games I played, so I have gone ahead and uploaded the kifu for your enjoyment. Commentary will come in future Monday Go Meditations (which I will note for each game); but hopefully you will forgive me for not being to add commentary within such a short time.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">With that said, let&#8217;s get started!</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span id="more-5140"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">To start, even though the tournament officially started on Saturday, I had the pleasure of getting to hangout and spend time with Myung Wang Kim (9p) and Park Sohyun (3p) on Friday. (In case some of you didn&#8217;t know, I got to know Myung at the <a title="North American Go Convention — Day 2" href="//north-american-go-convention-day-2/">North American Go Convention</a> last year.) After letting them do some exploring, we got dinner at a nearby Korean restaurant with some distinguished guests and ate delicious food.*</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><em>*Many thanks to our gracious hosts for footing the bill that night. It was a wonderful meal and was full of great conversation and great company.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Around the time dinner was wrapping up, I noticed that some of the guests were speaking to Myung in Korean. It seemed as if they were inviting him somewhere, and I was a little sad at the prospect of having to part ways so early in the evening; but to my great surprise, Myung then turned to me and asked if I would be interested in going with them to the local Korean baduk club?</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Me? Interested in visiting a local Korean baduk club? Absolutely!</p>
<figure id="attachment_5156" style="width: 448px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014-WOpen-02.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-5156" alt="2014-WOpen-02" src="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014-WOpen-02.jpg?resize=448%2C448" width="448" height="448" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Here&#8217;s a shot of the inside of the club. I refrained from taking any direct pictures of people playing since I didn&#8217;t want anyone feeling uncomfortable from me doing so.</figcaption></figure>
<p style="text-align: left;">When we walked into the club, it was amazing for me to see so many gorgeous boards and bowls sitting in one room. And to top it off, there were people playing! So cool! Granted, they all spoke Korean with one another so I was rather lost when it came to what they were talking about. However, it was nice to just bask in the atmosphere and while hearing the pleasant sound of the stones clicking on the board.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">After some time, we said our goodbyes and I took them back to their hotel so that they could rest since we had to be up early the next day.</p>
<figure id="attachment_5157" style="width: 358px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014-WOpen-03.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-5157" alt="2014-WOpen-03" src="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014-WOpen-03.jpg?resize=358%2C478" width="358" height="478" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">This was the banner you were greeted with when you walked out of the elevator.</figcaption></figure>
<p style="text-align: left;">Before I knew it, the momentous day had arrived. It was officially the first day of the 1st Washing Open Baduk Championship!</p>
<figure id="attachment_5158" style="width: 512px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014-WOpen-04.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-5158" alt="2014-WOpen-04" src="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014-WOpen-04.jpg?resize=512%2C384" width="512" height="384" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Look at all the people registering! And I got there pretty early too!</figcaption></figure>
When I arrived in the lobby for registration, I was pleasantly surprised to see so many people waiting in line! &#8220;Hoorah!&#8221; I thought, &#8220;Hopefully this will help convince the sponsors* to continue doing this again next year!&#8221;<br />
<em>*In case you didn&#8217;t know, this tournament was being hosted and sponsored by a number of Korean companies (you can see their logos above in the first banner) and featured a number of awesome perks like free entry fee, free lunch on both days, and even cash prizes).</em><br />
<figure id="attachment_5159" style="width: 512px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014-WOpen-05.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-5159" alt="2014-WOpen-05" src="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014-WOpen-05.jpg?resize=512%2C384" width="512" height="384" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">The sight of a room full of gobans and stones with people playing / discussing variations is always a great joy.</figcaption></figure>
<p style="text-align: left;">When I arrived in the playing room, I was also glad to already see a number of people already sitting and getting acclimated to the area. And as you can see, we were adequately prepared for a large number of players!</p>
<figure id="attachment_5160" style="width: 410px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014-WOpen-06.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-5160" alt="2014-WOpen-06" src="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014-WOpen-06.jpg?resize=410%2C546" width="410" height="546" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Here&#8217;s the schedule for both days. And if you&#8217;re wondering what&#8217;s in the upper right, they had Wi-Fi for everyone as well (which was awesome if I may say so myself).</figcaption></figure>
After a bit of waiting and catching up with various friends, the pairings were finally up. It was the fateful moment that you either dread or wait with anticipation when any tournament rolls around: the first round! The game that will set the stage for the rest of the tournament!<br />
My opponent was an older Chinese man who might have been in his fifties to sixties. He was a 3 kyu and the game was set as even with White getting 7.5 komi. The time settings were 1 hour main time per person with 20 moves per 5 minutes byoyomi.<br />
After exchanging customary greetings and fussing with the clocks for a bit, we started our game. The kifu below is our game. (The commentary version will be Monday Go Meditation: Game 60)<br />

<p style="text-align: left;">Though the game ended up being dramatic, I will have to say that I tried to play a calm and patient game as much as I could. (The idea originates from <a title="Maaike's April Challenge" href="http://www.thegochallenge.blogspot.com.au/2014/04/april-challenge.html">Maaike&#8217;s April Challenge</a>). As you saw, I ended up letting an advantageous position turn into a complete disaster. It was only by sheer patience and luck that I was able to turn it around. The game was one of the longest ones that round. It took more than two hours for us to finish and I used 3 periods of overtime.* Needless to say I was relieved to win, but I was exhausted afterwards as I went off to grab lunch.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><em>*On a side note, I just wanted to rant about how chess clocks are AWFUL for Canadian byoyomi because you end up spending more time trying to figure out whether the flag is about to tip instead of focusing on your move. So you end up playing super fast moves for fear of losing on time. Stressful I tell you!</em></p>
<figure id="attachment_5161" style="width: 512px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014-WOpen-07.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-5161" alt="2014-WOpen-07" src="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014-WOpen-07.jpg?resize=512%2C384" width="512" height="384" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">I got the salmon bento box for lunch! There was a variety of things: rice, korean noodle with some vegetables, potato salad, kimchi, bean sprouts, tempura shrimp, and a couple of other things. Very filling!</figcaption></figure>
Once everyone had eaten lunch, we had our opening ceremony (which seems a little backwards since the event already started, but it was necessary because the VIP guests could not arrive earlier).<br />
<figure id="attachment_5162" style="width: 512px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014-WOpen-08.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-5162" alt="2014-WOpen-08" src="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014-WOpen-08.jpg?resize=512%2C384" width="512" height="384" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">You can see them giving speeches up front and everyone being respectful and listening.</figcaption></figure>
After the ceremony was done, it was time for Round 2. My opponent this time was a Chinese woman in her forties to fifties and a 2 kyu. Since I won the first round though, there would be no handicap and White would still get 7.5 points.*<br />
<em>*In AGA tournaments, it seems that they calculate handicaps not based on rank but on your performance in the tournament as it progresses. </em><br />
Before the game started, I decided I would continue to try and play a calm game. The kifu below is the result. (The commentary version will be Monday Go Meditation: Game 61)<br />

<div id='glift_display4' style='height:500px; width:100%; position:relative;'></div>

<p style="text-align: left;">To be honest, I thought that I was ahead for most of the game. I thought I had done a good job securing territory and keeping White&#8217;s territory small. However, I never actually counted and only did rough estimations.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">My game took long as usual (though not as long as the first round) and there were a few people watching my game when it came time to counting. To my shock and disappointment (though probably not to your surprise), I was actually behind by 20+ points. My opponent was kind enough to try and say I was very strong and that she thought she was losing, but the defeat stung still stung quite a bit.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">After the game, I did my best to try and pick myself back up. After all, it&#8217;s just one loss right? My record was 1-1 now. No big deal. Just brush it off and play better the next round. However, Round 3 was upon me before I knew it (since there was no real break between the rounds).</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">At the end of the last round, I mentioned that there were a few people watching towards the end. One of those was the gentleman that I would end up playing this round. He was also a Chinese man in his forties to fifties and was a 4 kyu. In this game however, I would receive give him a 1 stone handicap and only got 0.5 komi. The kifu below is our game. (The commentary version will be Monday Go Meditation: Game 62)</p>

<p>It was an awful game. My stamina had already been spent with the first round. So with that and the fact that I was still rattled by my loss in Round 2, I could not keep calm and played one of the worst games I&#8217;ve played to date. Complete overplays and getting into fights I had no business getting into.<br />
Resigning within 100 moves&#8230; My record was now 1-2&#8230; Needless to say, I was upset and really disappointed with myself.<br />
After the game, I took Myung back to the hotel so he could get some rest before the lecture that night. We talked some in the car and I was given a lot to think about. I then went off to eat dinner by myself before it was time to pick him up again.<br />
<figure id="attachment_5163" style="width: 512px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014-WOpen-09.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-5163" alt="2014-WOpen-09" src="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014-WOpen-09.jpg?resize=512%2C384" width="512" height="384" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Unfortunately I only got one shot of Myung during his lecture, but I guess it&#8217;s better than nothing. (Would have preferred to have gotten one when there were stones on the board, but I was too focused on the lecture to remember to take another one.)</figcaption></figure>
After picking him up, we went back to the convention and Myung lectured on a joseki that had recently been created by young Korean professionals. A lot of it went over my head, but it was very cool to see how go is constantly evolving and changing.<br />
Once the lecture was finished, the crowd dispersed into different groups. A blitz tournament was about to start. And though I had originally planned on participating, I was not feeling up to it and decided not to. After all, today had been a rather disturbing revelation of the limitations of my go. I played one decent game and then proceeded to crash and burn&#8230;<br />
Earlier during the lecture, I had seen Park Sohyun (3p) come in and then leave the room with one of the VIP with a board and stones. While some people went up to ask Myung some questions, I decided to go check and see what she was up to. As I prepared to walk around, the following quotation from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/First-Kyu-Sung-Hwa-Hong/dp/0964479699">First Kyu</a> popped in my head:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;First kyu, a player of the first rank? Really? Have you ever competed in a professional qualifying tournament? No? Then you are not, I repeat NOT first kyu!<br />
I know I know. Nowadays all kinds of bad players call themselves first kyu.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8220;Maybe I&#8217;m just a fake 3 kyu,&#8221; I thought as I walked to find her, &#8220;Perhaps I was too naive and arrogant in thinking I could compete, let alone win, as a 3 kyu&#8230;&#8221;</p>

<h2><em>Weekly Go Wednesday, Issue #3</em></h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Of all the go topics in the entire universe, this is by far the single most popular one. After all, getting one stone strong is the eternal pursuit of every go player. There are a plethora of articles out there on how to do so, but my goal is to provide the fastest route for you to progress as a go player (to SDK at the bare minimum).</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For those who have never tried it before, playing an even game against a player that is reportedly two stones stronger than you can be a scary feeling. On one hand, you think &#8220;This can&#8217;t be too bad.&#8221; Yet, on the other hand, the board looks quite naked as you stare at the empty board while knowing that you should have two handicap stones sitting on the board. As someone who&#8217;s been through a couple experiences recently, it is quite the daunting feeling&#8230;</p>
<div style="text-align: left;"><span id="more-24"></span></div>
<p>Now, I understand that rank is, more often than not, a rather subjective one. A player can be stronger or weaker than his reported rank, and then of course there is the issue of whether your opponent&#8217;s playing style is weak to yours. Nonetheless, especially for players not yet in the high SDK and dan levels, the rank difference ends up impacting your mindset to some degree.<br />
The game was an intense one that left me with a racing heart and slight anxiety that I would misclick as my shaking hands attempted to place each stone. That being said, I am proud to say that today&#8217;s kifu has allowed me to obtain the &#8220;Beat a Stronger Player in an Even Game&#8221; accomplishment! In addition, being able to win against a stronger player in an even game has helped to reinforce my confidence against stronger opponents. Granted, I&#8217;m not saying I believe I can knocking down high SDK&#8217;s with ease; but I am now at least able to stand a bit straighter when faced with stronger opponents.<br />
Finally, today&#8217;s kifu has a special guest appearance from one of my favorite sensei&#8217;s: frozensoul! The kifu has a lot of great commentary and variations that I&#8217;m sure you could benefit from. The key lesson that I took away from his review is the usage of the double hane. If you are still feel a bit confused about that technique, be sure to look over the kifu for that explanation and more!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 style="text-align: center;"><em>Weekly Go Wednesday, Issue #2</em></h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">For many players, one of the major obstacles to playing go is time. After all, an average game can take anywhere from 60 to 90 minutes depending on the level of thinking that goes into each game. So in order to accommodate the faster players and those without much time, the format known as blitz go was born.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">For new players who&#8217;ve never played blitz go, the general idea is that you have less than a minute to make each move. If you fail to make your move within the allotted time, you lose by default on time.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">While there are different perspectives on blitz go, you should seriously consider the following points as to whether or you should be playing blitz go:</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span id="more-25"></span></p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Why You Should Play Blitz Go&#8230;</span></h3>
<ol>
<li>You can play an entire 19&#215;19 game if you&#8217;re under a time constraint.</li>
<li>It is an excellent way to see how good your instincts are. In other words, the strength of your fundamentals in the game and reading speed will be severely tested in this format.</li>
</ol>
<p><em>I really tried to come up with three reasons; but even when I included the obvious benefit that the games are much shorter, I don&#8217;t honestly believe there are any other strengths to this format. And you&#8217;ll see why with the following list.</em></p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Why You Shouldn&#8217;t Play Blitz Go&#8230;</span></h3>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>#1. Players are often rewarded for bad or desperate moves.</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">While this may seem like a reason to play go, in my opinion, this is ultimately a double edged sword that will often be more agonizing than anything else. Case and point, check out my game record below for two groups that are supposed to be utterly alive, but who get killed off in the end. And in the end, if one of your desperate plays happens to be successful, there is a pretty good chance you&#8217;ll think you figured out a clever play when in actuality it was just your opponent&#8217;s stupidity. So you&#8217;re ultimately just reinforcing an inflated ego that would be smashed to bits if your opponent just avoids stupid mistakes. Is that really the way you want to get stronger?</p>
<p style="text-align: left; padding-left: 30px;"><strong>#2. If players become accustomed to this format, it will often condition them to have the &#8220;play and hope it works&#8221; mentality. </strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left; padding-left: 30px;">Just like #1, this is a TERRIBLE habit for players to acquire. This will not only negatively impact your abilities, but it will make the game far less enjoyable because you&#8217;ll look back at your games only to regret the hopeful move you made that cost you the game.</p>
<p style="text-align: left; padding-left: 30px;"><strong>#3. In addition, players who become accustomed to blitz go will also be practically unable to return to regular go since their deep reading abilities will have ultimately become crippled. </strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left; padding-left: 30px;">Unless you happen to study your deep reading constantly on the side and have not been plagued with the impatience many blitz players acquire, your deep reading is going to go down the drain. On the other hand, a player who typically plays longer games of go will always have the ability to play blitz go.</p>
<p style="text-align: left; padding-left: 30px;"><strong>#4. Tournaments are rarely blitz go. </strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left; padding-left: 30px;">Let&#8217;s face it. The big tournaments around the world are primarily non-blitz. So when you go off to compete for prizes and such, you will be at a severe disadvantage compared to your opponents who are more accustomed to managing their time at different points in the game. Unless you are hoping to pressure your opponent into playing a faster game, I have a feeling you won&#8217;t be doing as well as you think.</p>
<p style="text-align: left; padding-left: 30px;"><strong>#5. It&#8217;s difficult to tell when you&#8217;re actually progressing. </strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left; padding-left: 30px;">If you were to chart your results and progress over time, there&#8217;s a good chance it looks like a roller coaster. There are times where you utterly crush your opponent&#8230; times you get crushed by your opponent&#8230;. and once every blue moon you&#8217;ll have a close game. Since a player&#8217;s rank is perhaps the most desirable aspect for most players, this would admittedly be frustrating to see no?</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The kifu record today is an excellent demonstration of the points I mentioned above regarding blitz go: careless errors, weird moves, desperate attempts that succeed despite the fact they are supposed to be terribly doomed for failure, and so forth.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Today&#8217;s shidougo lesson comes from a person that I&#8217;ve come to befriend and look up to: frozensoul. If you&#8217;d like to help support his efforts in helping out players trying to get stronger, please visit <a href="http://www.clossiusreviewroom.com/">his site</a> for more information!</em></p>
<p>I guess you could call this my first &#8220;shidougo&#8221; victory&#8230; but I wouldn&#8217;t classify this as that due to the fact that frozensoul was actually trying to create a tie. So in reality, congratulations are in order for frozensoul for being only one point away from creating a tie!<br />
Overall, I was really happy with my performance in this game. It honestly has nothing to do with the victory and more on the fact that I played almost every move with confidence. And for those who would remind me that frozensoul wasn&#8217;t actually trying to play anything crazy, the confidence I&#8217;m speaking of is more of a &#8220;I read it out to the best of my ability and I&#8217;ll give each move everything I got.&#8221;<br />
<span id="more-27"></span><br />
That being said, I still have a lot of work to do in regards to my connections and such. One example of an efficient connection that I&#8217;ve yet to really utilize fully is the hanging connection (see variation on Move 13). And even though I made a few moves that received compliments for being solid, I know that I have a ways to go before more of my moves are played with a simplicity and efficiency that gets a nod of approval from strong players such as frozensoul.<br />
Hope you enjoy the kifu and be sure to share any insights that you may have as you look over the game!<br />

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I have to admit that the responses that I received yesterday from my post have certainly made me reconsider my position from yesterday&#8217;s post, but ultimately I think it is more of a paradigm shift than necessarily regretting my decision to resign.<br />
For those of you who have never seen this video, please take 20 seconds and watch this unbelievable and tragic event happen to a professional 9-dan.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='720' height='405' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/qt1FvPxmmfE?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe>
<p><em>Can you imagine? Playing a professional game on live television as a professional 9-dan and then putting yourself in self-atari? Although you have to admit, the man handled himself quite well and his reaction was quite priceless.</em><br />
<span id="more-28"></span><br />
That being said, the reason for the second part of this post is due to a friend of mine, Justin, who commented on a distinction that I had not really considered: <strong>the competitive setting</strong>. For those who would like to read about his personal experience with both sides of the regretful win/loss, see his comment in <a title="The Desire to Win – Part 1" href="//the-desire-to-win-part-1/">Part 1 of this topic</a>.<br />
Although I may have declared that all games should be won with as much honor as possible, I was not fair in considering the many aspects that go contains.<br />
Like anything else in life, as much as we may try to make the right decisions, we are human and are prone to our mistakes. I recognize that the first post of this topic argued to &#8220;do the right thing,&#8221; but that does not take into account the fact that <strong>luck and mistakes are just as much a part of go as it is in anything else</strong>.<br />
Last night, my friend Nate said it best when he told me that, &#8220;<strong>In some regards, the basic notion of trying to catch up in a game is to hope that your opponent will make a slack move or even a mistake.</strong>&#8221; Those words really struck me and as a result, I&#8217;m sitting here re-evaluating the stance I had taken just hours ago.<br />
As Justin stated, competitive go is a completely different setting. Each win is coveted by every player. <strong>Your opponents will take advantage of every slack move, and they will punish you for your mistakes.</strong> Do not err in thinking that the &#8220;honorable win&#8221; will draw any sympathy from your opponents.<br />
Ultimately, for my own experience, the decision to resign is still not a regrettable one. While improving your rank may be arguably &#8220;competitive,&#8221; I would argue it&#8217;s more a casual thing where there is very little at stake except your ego and pride. (<em>Granted, some people would say that a person&#8217;s ego and pride is extremely important. I fall into the camp where I think ego and pride is overrated</em>.)<br />
When the time comes to tournament/competitive play however, I have every intention of winning with everything I have that day&#8230; and that includes skill, luck, and even my opponent&#8217;s mistake(s). Otherwise, I plan on winning with my strength alone, because that is the basis where our pursuit to become one stone stronger will ultimately come from.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Today, I am writing about a more solemn topic that I know most people would shy away from posting on. However, I believe that this post touches on something that almost every go player will encounter along their journey: <strong>the desire to win</strong>. It is a difficult topic for me to write at the moment since the disappointing kifu is fresh off the board, but by doing so I hope to capture a vulnerability that we all feel at one point or another.<br />
<span id="more-29"></span><br />
In terms of what I mean when I say the desire to win, I&#8217;m not just talking about the simple desire for victory. After all, most people enjoy winning and the feeling of doing so. Instead, I&#8217;m talking about the type of desperation to win that you lose your rationale and even if you somehow manage to win, it&#8217;s the type of win that eats away at you because you know you didn&#8217;t really deserve it.<br />
For <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Hikaru no Go</span> fans, the following scene should be familiar.<br />
<figure id="attachment_466" style="width: 392px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2012/09/hikaru83_06.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-466" title="Hikaru No Go - Chapter 83" src="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2012/09/hikaru83_06.jpg?resize=392%2C640" alt="" width="392" height="640" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Hikaru No Go &#8211; Chapter 83</figcaption></figure>
Who could possibly forget how tortured Hikaru felt afterwards? After all, is there really any honor or joy that can really come from a win like this?</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">The game record for today is precisely that kind of win.</p>

<p>For those who don&#8217;t have time to see the game record and the commentary, it essentially consists of me trying to win a capture race where I&#8217;m about six moves behind. And it wasn&#8217;t a complicated race, my group was two moves away from death. Ultimately, my opponent&#8217;s overconfidence caused him to actually lose his entire group.<br />
Now he still thought he was going to win, so he played it out to the end; but when he realized he was short 3.5 points, he left the game &#8220;for obvious reasons.&#8221;<br />
At first, I tried justifying to myself that I deserved that win. After all, it was my opponent&#8217;s cockiness and carelessness that led him to the situation&#8230;. serves him right&#8230;. right? I didn&#8217;t want to lose&#8230; I wanted my rank to go up&#8230; why should I give up my win for his mistake&#8230;.<br />
So in regards to the results of the game, technically, I did win with a +3.5 margin. After some thought and in the midst of drafting this post, I came to a realization. <strong>Even though most people would have viewed their opponent escaping as a frustrating event that might have even demanded the attention of an admin since the game had been played out to the very end, this should instead be looked as an opportunity for me to do the right thing.</strong><br />
Many people would say that the lessons in Go are parallel to those in life, and this is precisely one of those moments. <strong>Everything in life can ultimately be boiled down to which perspective you choose to take. And in the end, it is precisely these choices that lead us down the various paths we call our life.</strong><br />
Faced with a major crossroad, I decided to do the right thing: I resigned. If I let an admin or the system eventually force the game in my favor, that would be a permanent mark that I would never be able to change. By resigning, my spirit is at rest and I can move forward without the guilt.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;"><em>Welcome to the start of my Weekly Go Wednesday (WGW) series! This purpose of this series is to add some excitement to the middle of the week, so that before you know it, it&#8217;ll be the weekend again! If you have any requests or would like to be a guest writer on this series, be sure to let me know!</em></p>
<p>Unlike the games I&#8217;ve posted so far, today&#8217;s opponent has a bit of history that deserves to be recorded down for the ages to come. For those who want to check out the game commentary beforehand, go ahead and scroll down to the bottom before settling down with a hot beverage for a tale of a chance encounter that has been a big impact in my life ever since.<br />
<span id="more-30"></span></p>
<h3 style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Enter the Eagle</strong></span></h3>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">When I had just begun to become immerse in the world of go, I decided that even though I was stuck in DDK land, I would try and get private lessons. Looking back on it, I shake my head and laugh at myself since I had not even taken the time to properly learn the basics, and there I was trying to get private lessons. Anyhow, during my first lesson, my go teacher happened to mention that one of his students was around the same strength as I. Needless to say, as a new and enthusiastic player, I was thrilled at the idea of being able to play in person with someone around the same strength as me. After all, online go is fun; but it doesn&#8217;t come close to the enjoyment of being able to play on a real board with real stones.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Unfortunately, that would be my last lesson due to financial constraints; but coincidentally, my go teacher also went to one of the local go clubs to teach/review games. I had not attended club meetings as consistently as I would have liked, but I decided to go on one of his teaching nights. My go teacher had mentioned that the player he had mentioned might be attending that night, but let&#8217;s just say that I was not prepared for what the night would bring.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">With my eagerness to meet this player, I couldn&#8217;t help but nervously scoping out the attendees in an attempt to figure out who it was. I can&#8217;t quite remember who attended that night, but one thing I&#8217;m utterly clear on is that I saw an American guy there with a motorcycle helmet and related gear. I remember looking over at him and thinking, &#8220;Whoa! What is a guy like him doing here?!&#8221; And this wasn&#8217;t in a bad way at all, in fact it was more of a &#8220;What is a cool guy doing here?! And wait a second, he&#8217;s staring at the go board intently?! What&#8217;s going on?!?!?!&#8221; After all, in all my naivety for being new to the go scene, I just had this mental image of all go players being skinny Asian guys who were a bit shy and reserved. In fact, I half expected to meet a little kid that night who would be around my rank and then promptly school me.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">The night went by with everyone huddled around the board as my go teacher went over games and questions. After all was said and done, in the midst of goodbyes with my go teacher, he signaled for the cool motorcycle guy to come on over, and as you might have guessed&#8230; this was the player he told me about. Needless to say, I was flabbergasted&#8230; although I did my best not to show it in my face. Haha.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Since then, there have been many go games and adventures which would take many more blog posts for me to properly recount. Although I would have to say that one of the major highlights was getting to eat at this incredible ramen place&#8230;. what I would give to have a bowl of that right now&#8230; sigh&#8230;.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Delicious food aside, he has not only served as a fantastic rival (who has trounced me time and time again); but a valued friend that I look forward to knowing for a long time.</p>
<p>That being said, we began a weekly tradition of playing each other once a week, and this game is the first that I have posted since well&#8230; the other ones were pretty miserable. In fact, I&#8217;ll probably post some of those up in the future when I do a series on lessons that DDK players can learn from.<br />

<p>Overall, I felt that this game was a sign of even greater games to come. Even though I lost a major group towards the middle of the game, I feel that it was a sign of growth to know that the game was not yet over. And with the proper fighting spirit, I&#8217;d be able to make it a decently close game. Hopefully, you&#8217;ll feel that I managed to do so as well. Till next week!<br />
