				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So I didn&#8217;t think that game really was a good game for people to overview in terms of skill. I decided to play another game (against my better judgment). Here is an even game where the opponent requested an undo at three different occasions. They were blatant self-ataris, so against my normal policy I let him undo them. I did make one mistake and misread an atari and loss a group. Sticking with solid play and solid fundamentals let me win the game. He made a number of errors which I took advantage of, so perhaps the game might not have been a win for me. Enjoy.<br />

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So I just played against an 11k? and I have to say it was quite an unusual game. He essentially did four 3-3 invasions, and then attempted to stir fights. Now I don&#8217;t know if it&#8217;s simply because my estimated strength on KGS is no longer accurate, but I really felt like I should&#8217;ve been giving him 4 stones. He failed to make life for his groups three out of four times. I think that&#8217;s highly irregular for someone who&#8217;s potentially in the 11kyu range. I also checked out his rank graph, and it looks NUTS! I don&#8217;t get the progression considering the number of games he played. It&#8217;s not like he dominated every opponent.<br />
<figure id="attachment_681" style="width: 320px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2010/10/opponent-rank.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-681" title="opponent rank" src="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2010/10/opponent-rank.png?resize=320%2C240" alt="" width="320" height="240" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Look at that HUGE spike in October&#8230;</figcaption></figure>
Anyhow, here&#8217;s my game. Some moves are admittedly slow and not quite efficient, but I was happy to play a very solid game where I minimized cutting points and maximized on his. He essentially waited till the end and resigned. &gt;.&lt; The score would have been +253.5 in my favor. sigh&#8230; In terms of overall reading, I think I did alright this time. Nothing glaring that I particularly regret. That being said&#8230; *knock on wood*&#8230;. enjoy the game.<br />

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;m back and excited to be back.  So I played my first game on KGS this morning.  I have to say it&#8217;s quite an ugly game. I despise a number of my moves and misreads. So just keep that in mind when you look at it. In terms of why I&#8217;m posting it, it&#8217;s to just serve as a reminder to myself and others how different application of principles in your play is different than practicing.  One thing is for sure though, I did not let myself lose my composure when I made those mistakes. And since that was one of my main goals, I&#8217;m glad I could play well enough to come out with a half point komi win.  =D<br />

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So I think I&#8217;ll start summarizing my games with one word synopsis to describe the what I believe to be the ultimate aura and ambiance of the game. Today&#8217;s choice of word: slaughtered. In other words, like a lamb being led to the slaughter, I let a 12 kyu draw me into fighting situations where my (already poor) reading ability ruined any chance I had of beating him in the game. Let me run a few off my hand&#8230;. misreading capturing races, missing shortage of liberties, blatantly trying to save a group that was in atari which missed my reading. I do think I should have won. My strategy was far more solid overall, but I got drawn back into focusing on the fighting. There&#8217;s a little guy in my head right now yelling, &#8220;TERRITORY YOU IDIOT! THIS IS NOT FIRST CAPTURE!&#8221; Sigh&#8230; Enjoy the following horrific game that I am so ashamed to call my own.<br />

So as of this moment, I am just appalled at myself. In the blogs I&#8217;ve been reading about studying Go in China, I&#8217;ve noticed that almost there is a unanimous comment in terms of the strength of the children there. They all do one thing extremely well: fighting. Most of the bloggers comment of how they get outread in almost every situation. If I&#8217;m to even speak a word of going to study with them, I&#8217;m going to have to make sure that I at least outread my opponents here in the DDK world&#8230; (not to mention the SDK world as well). Thus, I&#8217;m switching up my regimen.<br />
Utter&#8230; brutal&#8230; training on my reading ability. KGS&#8230; I&#8217;ll see you when I return from my training.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So here&#8217;s the game that broke my miserable resignation streak from last night. It was a game against a 9k. We played with a proper handicap this time (one guy tried to give me less stones earlier and as the idiot I accepted&#8230; let&#8217;s just say it didn&#8217;t go so well).<br />
Overall, I definitely have come to see the game in a different light. As someone who was told that life and death is my first priority, it&#8217;s easy to get caught up in old habits and just simply try to kill the opponent&#8217;s stones the whole time. This game was a clear illustration of my growth from that mindset. At least I hope it is&#8230;<br />
