				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>For this week&#8217;s go meditation, I am featuring my game from the Pumpkin Classic that I had the pleasure of visiting for a round. This game was an interesting challenge for me since it had been a while since I had played a game in person, let alone play a handicap game. As this is a handicap game where I play White, I hope that my thoughts throughout the game will help you understand better why players sometimes make the moves they do in handicap games. Enjoy!<br />

<h2>One Point Lesson</h2>
<p>When playing as White in a two stone handicap game, don’t try to complicate the game too early. If your opponent punishes your overplays early on, you will have a hard time coming back</p>

This past weekend I had the pleasure of attending the NOVA Pumpkin Classic Tournament and seeing many friends there. And though I originally planned on playing in the tournament that day, I ended up being on call for work and thus planned on only attending to see friends and show my support.<br />
Upon arrival though, I got convinced to play in the first round since we had even numbers. And while I would have liked to have played for more rounds, it was simply not possible for me to do so with a possible work call coming at any moment.<br />
On the upside, I did get to play a round against an opponent I had played against in the Baduk Open Championship. I had decided to self-promote to 1k this time and was giving her a 2 stone handicap. The following is the game record (which I will be sure to review in a future Monday Go Meditation).<br />

<p>Though I am a little sad I was not able to stay for the whole day, it was great being able to see everyone. An especially big shoutout goes to the Stafford Go community: Robbie, Anderson, and Ramon for being there and sharing a great lunch with me.<br />
Other than that, I’ve been adhering to my training schedule without fail thus far. And though I had some initial plans for ramping up content production here on the blog, it’ll have to wait a bit as I am in the process of sorting through things. No worries though, you can still expect to see the usual here. Just don’t expect any new weekly columns in the near future. Haha.<br />
With that said, for all those who celebrate Halloween, wishing you all a spectacular Halloween full of fun and candy!</p>

<figure id="attachment_1054" style="width: 576px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2012/11/2012.10.29_PumpkinSmall.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1054" title="NOVA Pumpkin Classic 2012 Winners" src="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2012/11/2012.10.29_PumpkinSmall.jpg?resize=576%2C245" alt="NOVA Pumpkin Classic 2012 Winners by Gurujeet" width="576" height="245" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Photo by Gurujeet Khalsa</figcaption></figure>
<p style="text-align: left;">When I first walked into the tournament room, I remember staring longingly at the trophies lined up at the front of the room thinking, &#8220;Wouldn&#8217;t that be awesome if I could bring one of those home one day?&#8221; Never in my wildest delusions did I think that it would happen that very day. Nevertheless, there I was, with a 4-0 record and standing with the rest of the winners of the NOVA Pumpkin Classic 2012.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span id="more-930"></span></p>
<div>
After all was said and done, I headed downstairs to try and take in everything that had happened to me. When I was meandering around the first floor looking for a place to sit however, I saw Anderson and Rob walking in my direction. At first, I thought about avoiding them for fear of being ridiculed for the second round, but I quickly brushed aside such an absurd notion and walked up to talk with them.<br />
For the next thirty minutes, we had a great discussion regarding the various aspects of tournament play. For example, one of the aspects of tournament play that Rob found difficult was when he would get paired with children. As a grandfather, he cannot bring himself to win against them, so he was feeling a bit frustrated by his predicament. Fortunately, I had actually given this concept some thought before and suggested to him that he should instead try to make the game a tie. Or in the instance of tournaments, he should try and control the score so that the kid wins only by +0.50 points. By doing so, the game would become far more interesting and challenging.<br />
In addition, not only were my fears of being ridiculed for my play in the second round completely unfounded, but Rob praised me for being someone who really earned and deserved the results I got. I was grateful to hear him and say that, and expressed some of my guilt and regret at the reckless game that he saw me play in the second round. We all had a good laugh and talked about it a bit more before going our separate ways.<br />
There was still some time before I needed to leave for DC, so I sat outside and stared out into the open as I contemplated the day. I was completely drained, but it felt good to give everything I had and know that the experience from that day would serve as an excellent base for growing my skills for future games. To top it all off, a few days later I was mentioned in the AGA article as well! And to think that I was crazy enough to want to leave in the middle of the day because of one poorly played game. For shame&#8230; for shame&#8230;<br />
All in all, I&#8217;m definitely glad that I pushed myself to return to the competitive arena in go. It was an incredible experience, not because of the fact that I had great results, but because of the lessons that I have learned from my games and the people that I got to meet and socialize with that day. Thanks for reading this series and I hope you got something valuable out of it!

<p style="text-align: center;">Both players: 3-0, and I was facing my worst nightmare: <strong>another</strong> 4 stone handicap game.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">In terms of competitive play, this is probably the most intense of all scenarios. Both you and your opponent are aware that only one will emerge victorious, so there is a huge pressure to fight with everything you have till the very end because neither will yield in this kind of game. And as someone who has never been in this situation before, it was an overwhelming feeling that made me shake with anticipation.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">As the game was coming to a close, we had a pretty big crowd watching the game. And let me tell you, the only thing that could make losing a crucial game like this even worse would be to do so in front of a crowd of people.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">When we finished counting the score, I couldn&#8217;t believe my ears when I heard: &#8220;Black has 59 points. White has 88.5 points.&#8221;</p>

<p>I looked down at the empty board before me and waited for the third round to start. In all honesty, I was still shaken up from the second round despite the pep talk I gave myself at lunch. Part of me was worried that I would play another crazy game that would be disgraceful. Life has a funny way of jostling you out of your mood sometimes, and little did I know, but I was about to be given the spark I needed to get out of my funk.<br />
<span id="more-948"></span><br />
Anderson and his friend had just checked the pairings list and were making their way into the room. I was still sitting at the table closest to the list, so as Anderson&#8217;s friend made his way to his table, he noticed that I was sitting there. He paused by our table for a moment, looked at me momentarily, then turned to my opponent and said, &#8220;You be careful! This guy is a wild player!&#8221;<br />
I was a bit stunned and embarrassed for a second as I recalled <a title="NOVA Pumpkin Classic Tournament 2012 — Round 2" href="//nova-pumpkin-classic-tournament-2012-round-2/">the miserable game I had just played</a>&#8230; but then a burning blaze took hold of me and I thought&#8230;<br />
&#8220;Crazy player huh? I&#8217;ll show you how wrong you are about that!&#8221;<br />

<p><em> What the kifu fails to capture is how close I was to losing on time. I got caught up in finding the best endgame moves that I nearly forgot about how much time I had left. Luckily I realized it before it was too late.</em><br />
After my opponent resigned and we began cleaning up the stones, I started to feel a little excited as it dawned on me that I was undefeated so far. One more match, and I could have a perfect record!!!<br />
Just as soon as quickly as the excitement set in however, I started to feel a little anxious as I realized that there was one final match to carve it in stone.<br />
When the final pairing were posted, my heart sank when I saw my final matchup: Ben [8k] v. Black [12k].<br />

<p>In all my naivety, it never occurred to me that I might end up giving my opponent handicap stones. After all, the majority of the time spent playing online were either even games or against stronger opponents who would give me handicap stones, not the other way around!! To make matters worse, I had spent so much time studying how Black should deal with handicap games that I wasn&#8217;t quite sure what to do as White. And as if that wasn&#8217;t enough, my familiarity with handicap games extended as far as 3 stones. Now that I was facing an opponent with 4 stones, I couldn&#8217;t help but feel the blood begin to drain from my face as I stared down the menacing board.<br />
&#8220;All four corners are gone&#8230; I don&#8217;t even have one corner of influence to work with&#8230; I have no idea what I&#8217;m going to do&#8230;&#8221;<br />
<span id="more-936"></span><br />
As my mind began to race, I tried to calm down as I tried to reverse engineer White&#8217;s strategy in handicap games:</p>
<ol>
<li>White must play aggressively to negate Black&#8217;s advantage.</li>
<li>White must therefore deviate from standard tactics.</li>
<li>White must do the best job possible to confuse Black and complicate matters as much as possible.</li>
</ol>
<p>Okay. I had my strategy now. Rely on my reading abilities to help me kill something and I&#8217;ll be able to catch up&#8230; (<em>Boy would this get me into trouble&#8230;)</em><br />
After the customary exchange of &#8220;Have a good game,&#8221; I took a deep breath and reached for my first stone.<br />
First move: <a title="Keima Kakari" href="http://senseis.xmp.net/?KeimaKakari">keima kakari</a> on the upper right star.<br />

<p>As we counted the points, I couldn&#8217;t help but think about the numerous times I was supposed to die. My opponent, Anderson, had played very well. In fact, he came very close to demolishing me that game. I had overestimated my abilities and underestimated his ability to play great moves and avoid a critical loss. If it had not been for the connection (Move 171), I don&#8217;t think I could have won that game. My spirit was already polluted with so much shame at that point that I would have resigned had he cut off the groups properly.<br />
As we moved into the final stages of the game, I noticed that there was a man who was staring intently at our game. When I realized this, I felt an urge to cover the board in order to hide the shameful game that I had played; but we all know that such a thought is silly, so I did my best to focus on the remainder of the game. When the game was over, Anderson was kind enough to offer to eat lunch with me since we were one of the last to finish and I was alone, but I had some calls to make so I had to decline.<br />
I sat outside eating some rice and fries from a local Peruvian restaurant (<a title="El Pollo Rico Yelp" href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/el-pollo-rico-arlington">El Pollo Rico</a>) and stared aimlessly into the distance as I recalled the game I had just played: the miserable moves, the miraculous connection, and the empty victory. I was exhausted, and thoughts about calling it quits even crossed my mind.<br />
Somewhere amidst my pity party, I saw Anderson sitting down to eat lunch with the very man I saw intently watching our game.<br />
&#8220;That must be the guy he was telling me about that helps to review his games,&#8221; I thought, &#8220;No doubt they are probably talking about the game that we just played.&#8221;<br />
I felt a bit of envy as I wished that my buddy Nate was with me, just like the time at the New Jersey Open. I knew that if anyone could help knock me to my senses, he could do it. Alas, I knew that it was only wishful thinking. As I sat there, seriously considering the idea of going home for the day, I was reminded of the tagline that I used in my blog at one point, &#8220;Embark on an impossible journey with me as I attempt to become a professional go player before age 30.&#8221;<br />
I smiled as I realized how stupid I was being. Was this all I was capable of? After all, what kind of pro wins the first two rounds and calls it quits because the last game was not a game that he/she was necessarily proud of? In fact, even if I had lost the first two matches, I want to be the kind of player that who has the strength to overcome his failures and weaknesses and continue to play the best game possible till the very end.<br />
With a renewed confidence, I made my way back to the tournament room and looked at the pairing list for the third round &#8211; Ben [8k] vs. Black [9k].<br />
My first even game with +0.50 komi. A chance to prove that the first two games were not a fluke&#8230;</p>

<p>My opponent made his first move: upper left star.<br />
I stared at the board as I recalled memories of playing with my friend Nate: the various approaches I tried before, the numerous times he gave me advice as to how he tries to play as white, and how I should try to play as black. I wasn&#8217;t sure what was in store for me, because this was not going to be a fun casual Monday night game. This was a game that neither of us wanted to lose. After all, I&#8217;m sure that neither of us wanted to start the tournament off with a loss. Nonetheless, only one of us would come out a victor&#8230;<br />

<p>As we were cleaning up the stones, I felt dazed as I was still in disbelief that I had managed to pull of a win, and a narrow one at that. Before I could even really collect my thoughts together however, I heard that the next pairings had been posted. I walked over and scanned the list &#8211; Ben [8k] vs. Black [12k]. At first I was relieved since I wouldn&#8217;t be playing an SDK, but then it hit me: <em><strong>I have to give him 4 stones</strong></em>.</p>

<p>In my entire go playing experience, I have only participated in two tournaments: the UMBC Go Tournament (2010) and the New Jersey Open (2011). In both instances, I ended up participating because of friends who encouraged me to do so. Otherwise, I&#8217;m pretty sure my lack of confidence would&#8217;ve prevented me from doing so. When I recall both tournaments, I remember not doing so well at either. My record was 0-3 at the <a title="First Tournament!" href="//first-tournament/">UMBC Go Tournament</a> and (with confirmation from Nate) 3-2 for the New Jersey Open. (For those thinking that 3-2 isn&#8217;t so bad, I recognize that; but I assure you that I don&#8217;t recall the greatest feeling about my victories. Can&#8217;t say why, but that&#8217;s what I can recall.) I&#8217;m sad I didn&#8217;t blog more about those experiences, so I&#8217;m hoping to make up for that with this tournament.<br />
This is a six part series that will be released once per day (excluding weekends). So as the hors d&#8217;oeuvre to next week&#8217;s entree of daily posts, let the story begin&#8230;<br />
<span id="more-706"></span></p>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Event:</strong> NOVA Pumpkin Classic Tournament 2012</li>
<li><strong>Date:</strong> October 26, 2012</li>
<li><strong>Hosted by:</strong> <a title="Nova Go Club Website" href="http://novagoclub.org/" target="_blank">NOVA Go Club</a></li>
<li><strong>Rounds</strong><strong>: </strong>4</li>
<li><strong>Game Format:</strong> AGA Rules</li>
<li><strong>Main Time:</strong> 45 min</li>
<li><strong>Byoyomi:</strong> 20 moves in 5 minutes</li>
</ul>
<p>The morning of the tournament, I was running late and worried that I would miss the registration time. As someone who has run a tournament before, I should&#8217;ve known better than to think that they wouldn&#8217;t let me participate in the tournament. At worst, I would have to miss the first round and then participate in the rest of the rounds. Nonetheless, I was still relieved to make it in time for registration.<br />
When I got up to the registration table, I was asked to confirm whether I&#8217;d be registering as an 8k. My mind faltered momentarily as I second-guessed my decision to enter as an 8k, but memories of being crushed as an 8k at the Baltimore Go Club quickly brought me to my senses. Sure, I might be 7k on KGS, but that was me on my best days. There was no telling whether my KGS rating was truly accurate in terms of tournament play where there would be multiple matches whether I liked it or not. (<em>I will be writing an article on this in the near future, but hopefully you understand my rationale for now.</em>)<br />
After registering, I made my way to an empty table toward the back and sat down. As I sat around and waited for the tournament to begin, I fidgeted as I tried to figure out how I would pass the time. There was approximately 30 minutes before it would start, so I pulled out my iPad and tried to calm my nerves by solving some simple tsumego. After a few problems however, I got fidgety again and decided to review one of Lee Sedol&#8217;s games while waiting.<br />
When one of the stronger players saw me pull out his book, he joked with me about how if I was studying his games, than I would be able to beat everyone in the room. I smiled at his humor and nervously replied that nothing could be further from the truth. The book generated some interest with the players in the room, but it wasn&#8217;t long before I was trying my best to immerse myself in the his game.<br />
It wasn&#8217;t long before I heard Gurujeet (the tournament director) mention that the pairings were up. After cleaning up my area and packing away my stuff, I got up to check out the list. As I scanned down the list, I found my name &#8211; Ben [8k] v. White [5k]. As I stared at the matchup, I couldn&#8217;t help but feel dread creep up as I recalled the multiple times I had been trounced by Nate in our handicap games. After a few moments though, I tried my best to shake it off and made my way to the table.<br />
Table #6. I found it after circling the whole room, only to realize it was actually the table closest to the list with the pairings. As I put my stuff aside and sat down, I pulled out my iPad so that I could record the first match. The SmartGo Kifu was being a bit temperamental with the way it was putting the handicap stones (it put it on the upper left, upper right, and lower left stars instead of upper right, lower left, and lower right stars). After trying to fidget with it for a bit, I decided to flip it upside down to record.<br />
Once that was taken care of, we placed the handicap stones on the board. My then opponent extended his hand toward the clock to signal that I could hit the clock whenever I was ready. I looked at the clock momentarily as I wondered if I was ready for what I had gotten myself into. Then, reminding myself that this was not my first time playing with a 3 stone handicap, I shook off the feelings of doubt, looked up at my opponent, and hit the clock.<br />
&#8220;Have a good game.&#8221;</p>
