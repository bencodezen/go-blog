<h3>Synopsis</h3>
<ul>
<li>A great introductory book to the Chinese Opening.</li>
<li>Explanations are kept at a high level and thus allows for easy reading.</li>
<li>Appropriate for 10 kyu and stronger.</li>
<li>Recommended for serious players.</li>
</ul>
<p><span id="more-2875"></span></p>
<h3>What I Expected</h3>
<ul>
<li><span style="line-height: 13px;">An overview of the Chinese Opening that is easy to read and understand as long as there is some basic understanding of the opening.</span></li>
<li>Explanations of common approaches/responses to various responses to the Chinese Opening.</li>
</ul>
<h3>What You Can Expect</h3>
<ul>
<li>A nice and concise introduction to how the Chinese Opening grew to the popularity it receives today.</li>
<li>A clear and concise explanation as to why the high Chinese Opening fell out of popularity.</li>
<li>A good explanation for the ideal development and direction fro the Chinese Opening.</li>
<li>A [reprinted] article from Go Seigen on the Chinese Opening!</li>
<li>Over ten kifus for players to play through (although only parts of each game are utilized for commentary in the book while the rest is simply a kifu).</li>
</ul>
<h3>My Thoughts as 5 Kyu</h3>
<p>As someone who has studied the Chinese Opening rather extensively (at least from an amateur perspective), <span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Chinese Opening</span> by Yuan Zhou is a fantastic introduction to the fuseki.<br />
When purchasing this book, the key thing to understand is that this is an <em>introductory</em> book on the Chinese Opening. It&#8217;s main purpose is to introduce big concepts regarding the Chinese Opening in order to give players a broad understanding of how they should approach it. In addition, Zhou does an excellent job  illustrating how the Chinese Opening can be used by various styles of play: attacking, territorial, etc.<br />
Some of the areas it does not go extensively into include topics such as: how to respond when the opponent interrupts the Chinese Opening, different josekis and the reason for why one is better than another when considering the Chinese Opening, etc.<br />
Now of course, there is the question as to whether someone should simply purchase <a title="Book Review: The Chinese Opening (Kato)" href="//book-review-the-chinese-opening-kato/">Kato&#8217;s book</a> on the Chinese Opening instead.<br />
To put it simply, if your goal is to devote yourself solely to the Chinese Opening so that you can master it and use it to your heart&#8217;s content, then I would recommend going straight to <a title="Book Review: The Chinese Opening (Kato)" href="//book-review-the-chinese-opening-kato/">Kato&#8217;s book</a>. On the other hand, if your goal is to simply gain a better understanding of the Chinese Opening so you can counter it more effectively or use it occasionally in your games, then Zhou&#8217;s book is the one for you.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Overall Rating: 9 / 10 Ponnuki</h2>
<h3>Basic Information</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Title:</strong> The Chinese Opening: The Sure-Win Strategy</li>
<li><strong>Author: </strong>Masao Kato (translated by Steve Lloyd)</li>
<li><strong>Publisher: </strong>Kiseido</li>
<li><strong>Publication Date: </strong>May 1989</li>
<li><strong><strong>Page Length:</strong> </strong>145 pages</li>
</ul>
<h3>Synopsis</h3>
<ul>
<li>An in-depth explanation of the Chinese fuseki.</li>
<li>Covers a lot of various scenarios that players might encounter when trying to play the Chinese fuseki.</li>
<li>Appropriate for 8 kyu and stronger.</li>
<li>Recommended for serious players.</li>
</ul>
<p><span id="more-2799"></span></p>
<h3>What I Expected</h3>
<ul>
<li><span style="line-height: 13px;">A thorough explanation of the purpose and goal behind the Chinese opening.</span></li>
<li>Explanation of what happens when someone tries to interrupt the Chinese opening.</li>
<li>Examples of how the Chinese fuseki is used in different situations.</li>
</ul>
<h3>What You Can Expect</h3>
<ul>
<li><span style="line-height: 13px;">Everything I mentioned above plus&#8230;</span></li>
<li>Much more detailed explanation behind the purpose of individual aspects of the Chinese opening (e.g., How to respond when your opponent approaches the star point stone as opposed to the 3-4 stone of the Chinese opening).</li>
<li>How to handle building and destroying the large frameworks that can often result from peaceful games with the Chinese opening.</li>
</ul>
<h3>My Thoughts as a 5 Kyu</h3>
<p>As the first book I read on the Chinese opening, I was very pleased with the scope and breadth that Kato covers with this book. Although it seems rather short, Kato does a fantastic job starting from the very basics of the Chinese opening to small details that are very case specific. In addition, Kato covers a number of variations for each scenarios that helps to answer a lot of questions people might have as to why one result is better than another.<br />
While this book can read like a textbook and is difficult to fully absorb after only a single reading, I think it is a fantastic reference and would recommend it to any players who are serious about <em>studying</em> the Chinese fuseki.</p>
