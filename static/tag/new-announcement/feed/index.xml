				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For those who aren&#8217;t aware, I became a <a title="Website Review: Go Teaching Ladder" href="//website-review-go-teaching-ladder/">GoTeachingLadder</a> reviewer some time ago; but I have yet to see a request for a review yet. Then, as fate would have it, hilbert90 made a brilliant suggestion for the upcoming Monday Go Meditations series: Why not open the reviews to the readers as well?<br />
So, without further ado, I am excited to announce that:</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Monday Go Meditations will also feature game reviews for readers!</h2>
<p><strong>Q: What does it cost?</strong><br />
Other than submitting your game record and allowing me to use your game review in a post, it&#8217;s ABSOLUTELY FREE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br />
<strong>Q: Why should I submit my game here instead of GoTeachingLadder?</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Unless I&#8217;m out of town with no access to any internet, you can expect a turnaround within a week.</li>
<li>When your game review is posted on the blog, you might get some interesting insights from other readers!</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Q: How do I submit my game to you?</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Use the <a title="Contact" href="//contact/">contact</a> form to submit a SGF file to me.</li>
<li>Save your game on <a title="Eidogo" href="http://www.eidogo.com/">Eidogo</a> and be sure to include the link when you send your email.</li>
</ol>
<p><span id="more-2091"></span><br />
<strong>Q: What can I expect from the game review?</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>An in-depth review that primarily focuses on the game from your perspective.</li>
<li>My thoughts on what I think you&#8217;re trying to do and other ways I might have approached the same situation.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Q: Can I include questions or comments in my game?</strong><br />
Absolutely! In fact, the more you include in your game record, the better tailored the game review will be!<br />
<strong>Q: With Monday Go Meditation being a weekly event, won&#8217;t it take awhile before I see my review?</strong><br />
Excellent point. This is why I will be making sure to send you your review beforehand if the scheduled publish date is more than a week away.<br />
<strong>Q: I&#8217;m not comfortable with people knowing it&#8217;s my game. How do you plan to mitigate that?</strong><br />
<em>Unless you specify otherwise</em>, I will make the following modifications to all games:</p>
<ol>
<li><span style="line-height: 13px;">Both players&#8217; names will be changed to Black and White respectively.</span></li>
<li>Ranks of both players will be kept (if the information is provided) in order to give more perspective on the game.</li>
<li>The date and time of the game will be removed to further anonymize the game.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Q: How will I know when my game is being featured?</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>When you submit your game record, I will send you an email confirming that I received it and an estimated time as to when it will be featured on the blog.</li>
<li>I will send you a confirmation email a week before the game review is posted to inform you of the actual publish date.</li>
<li>A final reminder email will be sent out the day the post is published.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you have any other questions or are having difficulties getting your game to me, just <a title="Contact" href="//contact/">contact</a> me and we&#8217;ll be sure to work it out together! Can&#8217;t wait to see your games!</p>
