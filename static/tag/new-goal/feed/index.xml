				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Well everyone, looks like this will be my final post for 2012. As I look back at 2012 and all the craziness that has come with it, I am definitely glad that go is once again an important part of my life. It&#8217;s been a fun year with me getting back into go and then bringing the go blog back full force.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">In terms of how my progress, here&#8217;s my rank graph for 2012.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2012/12/2012-rank.png"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-1566" alt="2012 rank" src="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2012/12/2012-rank.png?resize=476%2C204" width="476" height="204" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><em>Note: I did not play a single ranked game in December though. So the graph seems a little weird&#8230; haha.</em></p>
<p>In terms of my big accomplishment, it would have to be that I made it into mid-SDK range. I must admit though, it seems like just yesterday when I was playing as a 10k. Not sure I feel much stronger though. =D<br />
For next year, my goal is to reach a solid dan status on KGS. Ambitious? Yes. Impossible? Don&#8217;t know till I try. =D<br />
<span id="more-1561"></span><br />
In regards to the blog, here are some things that that you can look forward to:</p>
<ol>
<li>Weekly Go Wednesdays will be back starting this very week, so please submit any topics or ideas that you might have!</li>
<li>More book reviews!</li>
<li>Go equipment review updates and new additions!</li>
<li>Guides for all players of all different budget sizes!</li>
</ol>
<p>Finally, I think it is only appropriate that I end the year with a game that I had the pleasure of playing over the weekend. It was a hard fought game where I experimented with a number of ideas. It&#8217;s a game that I am proud to include in my final kifu for 2012. As the title of this post suggest, this is a game where we both fought it out till the very last point.<br />
