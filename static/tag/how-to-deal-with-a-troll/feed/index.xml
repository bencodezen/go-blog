This was a pretty scary game for me. I know I&#8217;ve been playing stronger opponents in the ASR League in even matches, but for some reason playing a ranked game against a 3k gave me the jitters. And I didn&#8217;t go looking for this game, this guy challenged me. Looking back on it, I&#8217;m pretty sure he was trying to play against weaker players so he could feel all big and mighty. Too bad he came out the loser&#8230;.<br />

<p>This is definitely a game that I&#8217;m certainly proud to call my own. In addition, I had never really experienced playing against a troll until this game. If you want a glimpse as to what I&#8217;m talking about, you can see it in the kifu (more profanity and name calling occurs afterwards, but you&#8217;ll get the gist of it based on what I left in the record).<br />
I think this is a game that any players below 10k might find useful. So please check it out and hopefully you&#8217;ll learn something new from my game!<br />
As a final note, for players who have never encountered trolls before and have no idea how to deal with them properly, here is some advice from my personal experience today</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">1. <strong>Do not stoop to their level</strong> &#8211; In other words, don&#8217;t curse. Don&#8217;t insult. Nada. Nothing. Zip. Otherwise you can forget about reporting them to an admin and gaining any sympathy.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">2. <strong>Report it to an admin</strong> &#8211; This is particularly recommended when your opponent has either escaped and/or is threatening to drag the game on till the end of time by using byoyomi forever&#8230;. And if you&#8217;re wondering how to find an admin on KGS, they have a star symbol next to their username.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">3. <strong>Vent about it with a friend, and then move on</strong> &#8211; Thankfully I had frozensoul there at the time, who saw the debacle go down when it happened, and he helped me through it and thus I&#8217;ve come out unscathed. But seriously, once you&#8217;ve vented, don&#8217;t let the troll impact your joy and happiness in playing go. Completely not worth it.</p>
<p>That being said, I hope you guys will enjoy the commentary and the new format. Till next time!<br />
<del>In case anyone is wondering, it seems that the new updated template for Blogger seems to override the code for embedding Eidogo into the blog posts, so that&#8217;s the reason I&#8217;ve had to resort to linking out onto Eidogo. Sorry for the inconvenience!</del></p>
