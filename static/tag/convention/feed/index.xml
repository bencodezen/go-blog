For those wondering why I&#8217;m so excited, it&#8217;s because even though I have been blogging for a few years now and played for an equal amount of time, I have never been to a Go Congress.<br />

Yep&#8230; So anyhow, unless there is some cosmic force at play that I&#8217;m not aware of (where I&#8217;m destined to never go to a Go Congress), I will move heaven and earth to go this year. And so if you have any interest in going, please check out the link below and start getting ready for it!</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">With the North American Go Convention over, I must admit that I miss the excitement of knowing I was going to be spending the evening or day immersed in go and hanging out with great company. Nonetheless, let us recap what&#8217;s happened over the last five days:</p>
<ol>
<li>Attended two professional lectures.</li>
<li><span style="line-height: 13px;">Played 6 simultaneous games with professionals.</span></li>
<li>Managed to actually win one of my simul games.</li>
</ol>
<p>Below is a close-up of all the autographs on the fan and the related games that I played.<br />

<p style="text-align: center;"><a title="North American Go Convention — Day 5" href="//north-american-go-convention-day-5/">Game 1</a></p>
<p>Although it would have been great to play in the tournament, I felt that my time was spent really well on pro events. Tempering myself for battle is something I can do on my own, while attending pro events of this quantity is a whole different matter. I really do think that the time I spent at the NAGC has really helped to get me out of my rut and bring newfound motivation towards go.<br />
Overall, it was a fantastic experience that I would not have traded for the world. Not only did I learn so much and acquire a renewed motivation towards of go; but most importantly, I made some great friends and had a really fun time.<br />
I hope that you&#8217;ve enjoyed this series and hope to see you at a convention some day!</p>
