<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="color: #800000;"><em>WARNING: Contrary to my previous findings, it seems that Blogger may actually not be compatible period with Eidogo anymore. Let me know if you find otherwise.</em></span></strong></p>
<h3>Part 1: Putting the program into your blog.</h3>
<ol>
<li>Access the control panel for your blog.</li>
<li>Click <strong>Template</strong>.</li>
<li>Click <strong>Edit</strong> <strong>HTML</strong>.</li>
<li>A popup will appear that warns you the implications of editing HTML. Nothing to fear. Click <strong>Proceed</strong>.</li>
<li>Once your text editor appears, search for the tag <strong>&lt;/head&gt;.</strong></li>
<li>Move your text cursor to the beginning of the tag and press the <strong>Enter</strong>/<strong>Return</strong> key to create an empty line.</li>
<li>Copy and paste the following code in the new line break you just created.
<ul>
<li>&lt;script type=&#8221;text/javascript&#8221; src=&#8221;http://www.eidogo.com/player/js/all.compressed.js&#8221;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Click <strong>Save</strong> <strong>template</strong>.</li>
<li>Part 1 complete!</li>
</ol>
<h3>Part 2: Preparing your kifu for embedding.</h3>
<ol>
<li>Download your desired kifu (which should be an SGF file).</li>
<li>Open the SGF file in a text editor (e.g., Notepad).</li>
<li>At the very beginning of the document, paste the following code:
<ul>
<li>&lt;div class=&#8221;eidogo-player-auto&#8221;&gt;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Go to the very end of the document, paste the following code:
<ul>
<li>&lt;/div&gt;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Select the entire text and copy it.</li>
<li>Part 2 complete!</li>
</ol>
<h3>Part 3: Inserting your kifu into the post.</h3>
<ol>
<li>Edit the post that you want to embed the sgf file into.</li>
<li>On the left side above the text area, you should see two option: Compose | HTML, make sure that <strong>Compose</strong> is selected (it should have a darker gray background that looks as if it is indented).</li>
<li>Move your text cursor to the area in the post that you want to post the SGF file to.</li>
<li>Type <strong>PASTE SGF FILE</strong>.</li>
<li>Click on the <strong>HTML</strong> tab mentioned in Step #5.</li>
<li>Find the text you typed in Step #4. It should look something like this:
<ul>
<li>&lt;div&gt;PASTE SGF FILE&lt;/div&gt;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Highlight the entire code mentioned in Step #6.</li>
<li>Paste copied text from Part 2.</li>
<li>Click <strong>Save</strong> or <strong>Publish</strong>.</li>
<li>Success!</li>
</ol>
<h4>Disclaimers:</h4>
<ul>
<li>The Eidogo Viewer will not appear in the preview nor will it appear in the compose section. It&#8217;ll just look like a gigantic text version of your sgf file. Don&#8217;t worry though! It works on the actual site.</li>
<li>In case anyone is using SmartGo2 to create/modify their SGF file, the code they produce will cause Eidogo to not see the proper handicap, the players and their respective colors, komi, along with any commentary made throughout the game. As a result, I recommend that you use <a href="http://www.gokgs.com/download.jsp" target="_blank">CGoban</a> instead.</li>
</ul>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So today was nice. I got to play a few games in the morning. Can&#8217;t figure out for the life of me how to embed my games into the blog. I am definitely moderately web design savvy, but I guess my ability to figure out how to embed EidoGo into my blog = failure. If anyone knows how to do it, including where to upload the files so I can properly code the src and sgf urls&#8230; I&#8217;d be indebted to you.<br />
Anyhow, my KGS rank keeps moving up and down. So much for trying to play a lot of games to get a consistent rating. Looks like I&#8217;ve settled on 15k for now. I was at 14k yesterday, but due to me playing under time constraints and having multiple distraction&#8230; I timed out against the 11k bot and messed up games that I shouldn&#8217;t have messed up.<br />
As an overview, I played four games today. I lost to a 13k due to some misreads and thus my ranked dropped to 16k. Then I proceeded to play an awesome game with a 17k which I won by resignation. Then I proceeded to get my rematch with the 11k bot and beat him by 26.5 points. And finally, I played a grueling game with a 14k where I think I played the best I have so far. I would integrate that game into this post&#8230; but alas I am lost on how to do that.<br />
I&#8217;m happy with my progress so far. I just need to increase my reading ability&#8230;. patience and foresight&#8230;. that will get me to the SDK ranks&#8230;.</p>
