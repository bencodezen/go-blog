				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 id="introduction" style="text-align: center;">Introduction</h2>
<p>Contrary to what I said last week, this week’s Monday Go Meditation features my Yunguseng Dojang game from last week. The reason for this is two-fold: (1) I didn’t play any other games over the past two weeks and (2) I’m still trying to keep MGM as current as possible.<br />
As I mentioned before, I was feeling rather iffy before this game. My opponent was around 4–5k in strenghth, and with my ups and downs lately, I wasn’t so sure that I could even beat him. But before I could wallow too much in my own insecurities, the game started.<br />
<em>Note: Similar to the other YSD match I posted last week, any specific things I learned from the review will be omitted in this game to respect other members’ paid membership.</em><br />

<p>When playing a moyo vs moyo game, don’t get caught up in small gains (like taking a corner) when big points like an opponent’s corner enclosure on a double winged formation are available on the board.<br />

no,Category,Good,Bad<br />
1,Opening,<strong>Move 10</strong> &#8211; This is not so much a good move as it is a move I’m proud of because it showed kiai on my part to be willing to compete with Black on a moyo game.,&#8221;<strong>Move 18</strong> &#8211; Though this moved seemed nice at the time, it was not very effective in terms of the whole board.&#8221;<br />
2,Attack and Defense,<strong>Move 44</strong> &#8211; The fact that I was able to take a step back to defend my group first before overextending my attack was a sign of progress for me.,<strong>Move 72</strong> &#8211; Trying to invade to attack the Black group was a bad attack.<br />
3,Shape,<strong>Move 162</strong> &#8211; Recognizing this clamp instantly was a nice moment for me since it meant I was increasing my repertoire of techniques to use.,<strong>Move 108</strong> &#8211; This doesn’t really defend my corner and makes bad shape.<br />
4,Strategy,<strong>Move 148</strong> &#8211; Sacrificing my four stones to push and cut here is one of the key moves that allowed me to secure my win.,<strong>Move 62</strong> &#8211; This peep and following sequence to take the corner was too small strategically.<br />
5,Overall Reading,<strong>Move 208</strong> &#8211; Reading out Black’s subsequent atari and seeing how it played out was a pretty big moment for me even though I missed the killing move at the end.,<strong>Move 82</strong> &#8211; The following sequence was just awful for me. Complete misread.<br />
6,Endgame,&#8221;<strong>Move 120</strong> &#8211; Though this move was an overplay, the idea of taking sente instead of responding to Black was good.&#8221;,<strong>Move 86</strong> &#8211; Blocking here instead of defending my bottom group nearly allowed my opponent to reverse the game in his favor.<br />

<p>For this week, I’ve decided to honor a request made by my friend Rob who asked that I review the game that was the cause for my post on being confused. Though I haven’t been commenting on games from YSD, I’ve decided to make an exception for this one.<br />
Just to note though, any specific insight that was taught by Inseong is withheld from the commentary in order to respect other member’s paid memberships. So while I will comment on what I understood on my own, any specific details will be omitted in this review.<br />
Hope you enjoy this review!<br />

no,Category,Good,Bad<br />
1,Opening,<strong>Move 39</strong> &#8211; This move is the only one I’m “proud” of since it took full advantage of White’s mistake in this joseki.,<strong>Move 19 and 29</strong> &#8211; Both these moves were bad since I was unable to punish White for his mistake in the joseki.<br />
2,Attack and Defense,<strong>Move 97</strong> &#8211; Recognizing that my group was in trouble and defending it was a rather proud moment since I might have normally left it alone.,<strong>Move 19 and 29</strong> &#8211; These moves are worth mentioning again since they were missed opportunities to attack White early on.<br />
3,Shape,<strong>Move 65</strong> &#8211; Getting this shape point allowed me the chance to start gaining the upper hand in this game.,&#8221;<strong>Move 95</strong> &#8211; Though it looks like good shape here, I consider this a bad move since the shape gave me little value on the board as a whole.&#8221;<br />
4,Strategy,<strong>Move 53</strong> &#8211; Trying to remove White’s base in order to attack White seems to be a key moment to why I was able to gain an advantage in the game., <strong>Move 93–95</strong> &#8211; Continuing to try and kill it in such a direct manner however was a mistake.<br />
5,Overall Reading,<strong>Move 271</strong> &#8211; Being able to calmly choose the correct move instead of the automatic move I might have made normally was another proud moment.,<strong>Move 111</strong> &#8211; Connecting here out of fear still shows the immaturity of my reading.<br />
6,Endgame,<strong>Move 143</strong> &#8211; Recognizing that I could start the endgame since I was ahead was something I was unable to do before.,<strong>Move 237</strong> &#8211; Defending directly here was a mistake that gave White three extra points.<br />

<p>This is my first proper ranked game in almost two months. Although I&#8217;m sad to say that I have not been able to have a decisive win yet, it was a game where I felt I was actually in control and not attempting to be too reckless. Plenty of mistake were made, but I am happy to say that my mistakes were never on epic proportions. =D<br />
