				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 style="text-align: center;">Introduction</h2>
<p>For this week&#8217;s meditation, I will start by prefacing the fact that before I started playing this game, I noticed my opponent was German. Based on my experience thus far, there are three groups of players that have been consistently aggressive and challenged my reading abilities constantly: Russians, Koreans, and Germans. This is by no means a bad thing, but it certainly made me a tad nervous. And just as I guessed, I ended up with another bloody game on my hands. It&#8217;s starting to make me think there is a trend in my games&#8230; Enjoy!<br />

<h2 style="text-align: center;"><strong>One Point Lesson</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: center;">Always choose profit over the very difficult task of killing a group. Then if your opponent decides to neglect his group and the conditions are ripe, then it&#8217;s time to pounce.</p>

<p>For the second Monday Go Meditation of 2014, I thought it would be great to feature the game where my sensei (frozensoul) and I played a game together online. While this was not rengo, it was a really interesting experience to have frozensoul&#8217;s input on the game while I was playing. You very quickly come to realize how differently high dan level players actually think. I hope that you enjoy this game and see the difference I&#8217;m talking about. =D<br />

<h2 style="text-align: center;"><strong>One Point Lesson</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: center;">It&#8217;s okay if your opponent keeps trying to kill your probe stone, it&#8217;s actually really hard to truly silence it.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For this week&#8217;s bonus review, we come to the final conclusion of my Canada Go League performance! After my performance from the third game, my goal was to be much calmer during this game and avoid any big blunders like before. Do I manage to end with a 3-1 record? Or will I be put in my place again and be left with a 2-2 record? Jump into the kifu and find out!<a href="//wp-content/uploads/2013/10/2013.10.23-October-2013-Bonus-Review-Game-4.sgf"><br />

<p>For today&#8217;s go meditation, I will be reviewing a game I played recently with fellow go tweeter goBum! Though we have known each other for quite a while now, I&#8217;m surprised it&#8217;s taken us so long to finally play a game with one another. =D Nonetheless, I&#8217;m glad we were finally able to do so and you can see the game below along with some insight that I received from a dan player who gave us a review afterwards. There are quite a few moments where I made abysmal moves that are shameful and vulgar, but it was a fun game and I definitely learned quite a bit from it. Many thanks to goBum for letting me use the kifu and I hope I can give you a better game next time!<a href="//wp-content/uploads/2013/08/2013.08.05-MGM-21.sgf"><br />

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Life is funny sometimes. Just when I thought I had a breakthrough in my go, I went ahead and played one of the worst games I&#8217;ve played in awhile. For those who have experienced the ups and downs of go, you know what I&#8217;m talking about: reckless go. For those who don&#8217;t know what it is, it consists of the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Follow my opponent around the board.</li>
<li>Try to kill everything possible.</li>
<li>Fail to notice any of my own weak groups.</li>
<li>Have little to no legitimate purpose behind my moves.</li>
<li>Play locally and hope it works out on the entire board.</li>
</ol>
<p>Fortunately, I was not given the chance to slink away in shame and got promptly reamed out for my play. So, as instructed, I will be taking tonight to retreat into solitary and repent for my miserable play by writing down &#8220;The List&#8221; 50 times. (Proof will be posted tomorrow.) In addition, I want to thank my opponent for not letting me get away with my overplays. I will give you a better game next time!</p>
