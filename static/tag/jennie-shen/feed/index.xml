<p class="p1">With the tournament officially off my mind, I have to admit it was kind of refreshing waking up without the worry of getting there at a specific time. I still got up a bit early though, as I wanted to run on over to sign up for simuls before the spots filled up. After all, since I wasn’t playing in the tournament anymore, I decided to set a new goal for myself: get as many simul games with professionals as possible!</p>
<p class="p1">After putting myself down for two games, my girlfriend and I went off to try a popular breakfast place: Clinton St. Baking Company. And while there was a decently long wait (considering it was a Thursday morning), it was definitely well worth it.</p>

<p class="p1">By the time I got back to Congress, the match had already finished and people were getting ready for the pro events (i.e., lectures, game reviews, simuls, etc.). I would be playing Jennie Shen 2p, who was Michael’s teacher.</p>
<p class="p1"><span id="more-5732"></span></p>
<p class="p1">The following is the game record:</p>

<p class="p1">After the game was finished, I made a point to introduce myself to Jennie and told her that I was friends with Michael. Her face lit up with a smile as she recognized who I was referring to and we talked a bit before I excused myself since I didn’t want to take her away from the simul games any longer.</p>
<p class="p1">Since my game ended early, I went off with my camera to find Myung (9p), Jungsang (9p), and Dahye (4p) since they had essentially designated me their unofficial photographer for the Congress.</p>
<p class="p1">Here you can see Dahye providing game reviews to members of the audience who had questions about their own games.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/09/2014GC-D05-08.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5736" src="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/09/2014GC-D05-08.jpg?resize=720%2C480" alt="2014GC-D05-08" width="720" height="480" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">In the next few shots, Myung and Jungsang were giving a lecture on recent developments in joseki that was apparently for dan players. However, I have to say that their explanations were easy to understand and I didn’t feel out of place as I listened to them.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/09/2014GC-D05-20.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5738" src="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/09/2014GC-D05-20.jpg?resize=720%2C480" alt="2014GC-D05-20" width="720" height="480" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">One of cool things about the Korean pro events that I forgot to mention is that they were giving out all sorts of prizes.* This included things like go related souvenirs (i.e., the go dice I talked about earlier in the week, miniature go board with Hikaru and Sai on it, etc.).</p>
<p class="p1">*Just to clarify, I am not saying that the other professionals didn&#8217;t have their own form of prizes and such, it&#8217;s just that I can only vouch for the Korean pro events since I didn&#8217;t get the chance to attend any of the other ones.</p>
<figure id="attachment_5739" style="width: 800px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/09/2014GC-D05-38.jpg"><img class="wp-image-5739 size-full" src="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/09/2014GC-D05-38.jpg?resize=720%2C540" alt="2014GC-D05-38" width="720" height="540" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Here you can see one of the gifts that someone won at this lecture: a portable go set that the Korean Baduk Association had produced.</figcaption></figure>
<p class="p1">After the lecture concluded, I went upstairs to my final simul of the day against Shirley Lin, 1p. The following is the game record:</p>

<div id='glift_display2' style='height:500px; width:100%; position:relative;'></div>
<script type='text/javascript'>gliftWidget = glift.create({"divId":"glift_display2","sgf":"http:\/\/bengozen.com\/\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/09\/2014.08.14-US-Go-Congress-Shirley-Lin-1p.sgf","display":{"theme":"DEFAULT","drawBoardCoords":"1"}});</script>

<p class="p1">After my game, I went to see what everyone was up to but had a difficult time locating anyone. So with no one to hangout with or any concrete plans, I took my girlfriend out to a vegetarian kosher place (which was absolutely amazing).</p>
<figure id="attachment_5740" style="width: 800px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/09/2014GC-D05-40.jpg"><img class="wp-image-5740 size-full" src="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/09/2014GC-D05-40.jpg?resize=720%2C540" alt="2014GC-D05-40" width="720" height="540" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">This was their black-eyed pea cake, which was a phenomenal appetizer.</figcaption></figure>
<figure id="attachment_5741" style="width: 800px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/09/2014GC-D05-41.jpg"><img class="wp-image-5741 size-full" src="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/09/2014GC-D05-41.jpg?resize=720%2C540" alt="2014GC-D05-41" width="720" height="540" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">This was their special that night, which was similar to their braised seitan with spinach and mushrooms. It was delicious!</figcaption></figure>
<p class="p1">After dinner though, my memory is a bit hazy as to whether anything else of significance happened that night. I vaguely remember going back to Congress to talk with Myung, but I can’t remember much else happening. Haha. Nonetheless, it was a fun day that consisted of good food and go!</p>
