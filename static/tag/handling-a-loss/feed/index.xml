				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In my experience thus far, one of the most difficult things to swallow is losing a won game. And let me tell you, boy did I royally screw this one up.<br />
The thing that makes this kind of loss worse is the fact that you know it&#8217;s entirely your fault. There&#8217;s no ifs and or buts to be said about it. Unlike other games where a slightly slower reaction time can make the difference or luck comes into play, Go is purely about your inner strength and ability to make the right decision.<br />
<span id="more-36"></span><br />
I&#8217;m writing this post right after a game that I knew I could definitely win, but my overconfidence allowed my opponent to advantage of my weaknesses and turn the game around in his favor [Move 250]. As you might guess, I am feeling pretty crappy at the moment.<br />

<div id='glift_display1' style='height:500px; width:100%; position:relative;'></div>
<script type='text/javascript'>gliftWidget = glift.create({"divId":"glift_display1","sgf":"http:\/\/bengozen.com\/\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/08\/2012.08.30-Losing-a-Won-Game.sgf","display":{"theme":"DEFAULT","drawBoardCoords":"1"}});</script>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div align ='center'><noscript>Please enable JavaScript to view this game.</noscript> <a href='//wp-content/uploads/2012/08/2012.08.30-Losing-a-Won-Game.sgf' download>Download SGF</a></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
Here&#8217;s the thing though. When the game is over and you&#8217;re staring into the abyss thinking of the move you should have made, do not despair and fall into a spiraling pit of regret.<br />
So I messed up this endgame pretty awfully this time around. Guess what. There will be numerous games after this where I will try my utmost to prevent from happening again. And when solid endgame play becomes second nature to me, guess who&#8217;ll be getting stronger once more?<br />
I will not dwell on this any longer, as discovering a weakness is simply another opportunity for gaining strength. So onward I&#8217;ll go, towards the pursuit of the player I know that I am capable of becoming.</p>
