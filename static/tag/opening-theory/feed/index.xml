<h2 style="text-align: center;">Overall Rating: 4.5 / 5 Ponnuki</h2>
<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Basic Information</span></h3>
<ul>
<li>Title: The Power of the Star-Point &#8211; The Sanren-Sei Opening</li>
<li>Author: Shukaku Takagawa, Honorary Honinbo (translated by John Power)</li>
<li>Publication Date: July 1988</li>
<li>Page Length: 134 pages</li>
</ul>
<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Synopsis</span></h3>
<ul>
<li>This is a fantastic book for players who want to be exposed to lots of different concepts without being inundated with dense diagrams and explanations.</li>
<li>The book covers a very broad range of material that makes it a valuable purchase for those who have a difficult time with some of the other more dense material.</li>
<li>Appropriate for 12 kyu and stronger.</li>
<li>Recommended for serious players and above.</li>
</ul>

<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Detailed Review</span></h3>
<h4>Readability &#8211; 8 / 10</h4>
<p>As someone who has read perused his fair share of books regarding the opening and fuseki theory, I found The Power of the Star Point to be extremely refreshing due to its focus on a single opening concept. While the overall language is relatively light and easy to understand, the material itself can be quite dense at times. On the other hand, what else do you expect from a book focused solely on the sanrensei?</p>
<h4>Content Quality &#8211; 9 / 10</h4>
<p>Fantastic coverage on a topic that many amateur players could really benefit from. Even though I &#8220;read&#8221; the book once, there is still a lot that went over my head and I&#8217;m sure that I will have more to gain the next time I read it. It was great to have him explain the different joseki&#8217;s and how they were either beneficial or detrimental to the sanrensei concept. Fantastic book that deserves 5 stars for the coverage of a topic that deserves the proper attention.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>The Power of the Star Point is a magnificent insight into the opening, handicap go, and whole board thinking all in one shot. It is definitely the book that gave me my breakthrough in understanding moyo formation, whole board thinking, and star point power in a whole new way. This is definitely a book you don&#8217;t want to miss out on if you have the opportunity to read it.</p>

<strong>What did I enjoy about the book?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>There is a LOT of content for such a small book.</li>
<li>Covers nine concepts that are useful for more advanced players.</li>
<li>Has ten practice problems that are graded on a scale as opposed to simply right or wrong.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What did I gain from reading this book?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>As a beginner, I had a hard time grasping anything from the book.</li>
<li>As a more advanced player, I felt that I gained a better understanding of the opening. Though I will say that the boost in my confidence was only moderate.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What style of teaching does the book use?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Textbook Approach
<ul>
<li>Content is organized in a curriculum format and follows a lecture style of writing.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Primary Learning Mechanism:
<ul>
<li>Explanations with example diagrams</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Other Learning Mechanisms:
<ul>
<li>Practice problems</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What aspect can be improved on?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>I would have liked to see more problems in the book to allow the reader to practice what he/she learned.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Is this book easy to read?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>As a beginner, this was not an easy book to read. The material was rather dense and was difficult to understand. For players that are more advanced however, the book is written rather concisely and one will appreciate how much content is packed into such a small book.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Bottom Line</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>If you are a beginner, steer clear of this book. This is for more advanced players.</li>
<li>This book is more of a synopsis of the opening as opposed to a step by step guide to the opening.</li>
<li>People are interested in learning about the opening should check out <a title="Book Review: Opening Theory Made Easy" href="//book-review-opening-theory-made-easy/">Opening Theory Made Easy</a> first.</li>

<strong>My Abilities</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>I was utterly brand new to the game when I first received this book.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>My Perspective</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>I was looking forward to reading about the beginning steps that beginners should take.</li>

[expand title=&#8221;My Review&#8221; trigclass=&#8221;expandTitle&#8221; expanded=&#8221;true&#8221;]
When I first read this book, I was an 18 kyu eager to learn all he could about go. Unfor­tu­nately, this was the first book I encoun­tered and it was so dense I was nearly dis­cour­aged from learn­ing any­thing more about open­ing the­ory. The rea­son this book receives a low score on read­abil­ity is due to the notion that it is an “ele­men­tary” book. With the West­ern edu­ca­tion sys­tem, most of us would assume that it should be appro­pri­ate for newer play­ers. Noth­ing could be fur­ther from the truth.<br />
Its small size is decep­tively wel­com­ing, but the con­tent is incred­i­bly dense and cryp­tic for newer play­ers. This makes it near impos­si­ble to make any of the infor­ma­tion applic­a­ble to your games. So while you may be plant­ing seeds of wis­dom for a time when you will have an epiphany, it may be some time before you can see the fruits of your labor. After all, the last thing I want to see are peo­ple putting their pre­cious time and effort into a book that may not be as help­ful as they hoped. As a result, if you are a beginner, I highly rec­om­mend steer­ing clear of this book and start­ing with <a title="Book Review: Opening Theory Made Easy" href="//book-review-opening-theory-made-easy/">Open­ing The­ory Made Easy</a> if you really want to learn more about the opening.<br />
Now that my rant as a beginner is done, I want to turn the other side of the coin and emphasize the fact that this book has an incredible amount of information for such a small book. There are many nuggets of wis­dom in here for those who are able to actu­ally under­stand the book. In addi­tion, the last chap­ter con­sists of prob­lems that are quite use­ful in gain­ing a bet­ter under­stand­ing as to why some open­ing points are bet­ter than others.<br />
Finally, I also want to mention the fact that this book does NOT cover fuseki patterns (e.g., Chinese opening, ninren-sei, sanren-sei, etc.). It is simply focused on establishing basic principles and methods behinds the opening. Nothing more than that.<br />

<h3 style="text-align: left;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Detailed Review</span></h3>
<h4 style="text-align: left;">Readability &#8211; 9 / 10</h4>
<p>There are twenty chapters in this book, hence the twenty principles. Hideo does a fantastic job of reviewing basic principles of opening theory while keeping his responses short and concise. This makes it extremely easy to gain lots of exposure to various important concepts so that you can try implementing it in your games instead of being caught up in dense theory that will take ages before you see it appear in your game.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: left;">Content Quality &#8211; 9 / 10</h4>
<p style="text-align: left;">This is a book that delivers on exactly what the title says. Opening theory made easy. As if that wasn&#8217;t enough to get you excited, they have twenty one-line principles to simplify it even further. Every concept is explained within 5-10 pages including diagrams! This might seem short to some, but the key is gaining a solid grasp of the principles so that they appear in your play. The details regarding opening theory will be dealt with when you get to it.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: left;">Conclusion</h4>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Opening Theory Made Easy</span> is what <span style="text-decoration: underline;">In the Beginning</span> should have been. When a new player buys a book that says &#8220;in the beginning&#8221; and is the first volume in an &#8220;elementary&#8221; go series, you&#8217;d think that it would be simple to follow. For those who haven&#8217;t invested in this series, steer clear for now. If you&#8217;ve already purchased it, don&#8217;t worry about it. That book will be a nice book to study after you understand this one.<br />
This will definitely be a classic that I will re-read over and over again. Bravo Otake Hideo. This one will definitely go in the hall of fame in my library of Go books.<br />
In summary though, if you are even remotely interested in the opening theory of the game, this is THE book to buy. It&#8217;s portability and ease of reading will have you blowing through it in no time and learning a lot of crucial principles that will be critical to your growth in the game. Don&#8217;t delay! Buy it now!!!</p>
