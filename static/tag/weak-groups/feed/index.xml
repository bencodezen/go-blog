[expand title=&#8221;Before I Read This Book&#8230;&#8221; trigclass=&#8221;expandTitle&#8221;]
<strong>My Abilities</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A mid-high SDK (single digit kyu) who has read his fair share of books and has a decent foundation of most areas in go.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>My Perspective</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Since these are written to be more of a &#8220;workshop&#8221; format, I was looking forward to a new style of writing along with a refreshing perspective on some common questions that most players might have.</li>
</ul>
[/expand]
[expand title=&#8221;Synopsis&#8221; trigclass=&#8221;expandTitle&#8221;]
<strong>What did I enjoy about the book?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>As usual, Yang continues to breakdown topics into simple explanations that I could easily understand.</li>
<li>The topics are extremely relevant to the average player since a majority of go literature assumes that the reader is already familiar and well versed in these basic concepts.</li>
<li>Yang usually has a checklist of questions for each section to remind the reader of the important things to remember.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What did I gain from reading this book?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A much better understanding of how to evaluate whether a group is weak or not.</li>
<li>Better grasp on what forcing moves are. Though applying it is still rather hazy for me.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What style of teaching does the book use?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Workshop Format
<ul>
<li>Topics of broken down into its simplest format and represents more of an outline than a thorough textbook.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Primary Learning Mechanism:
<ul>
<li>Explanations with accompanying diagrams</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Other Learning Mechanisms:
<ul>
<li>Practice problems</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What aspect can be improved on?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Though the examples can be helpful, I found that they slightly overwhelming after some time since I am still having issues actually understanding the concept solidly. A good example of this is whether or not a forcing move is good or bad. I have a general idea, but that&#8217;s all. So before I get into the weeds of how to use it, it would have been better to have more basic practice questions.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Is this book easy to read?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Yes. The explanations are concise and the accompanying diagrams are often no more than a few moves long.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Bottom Line</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Breaks down topics into really easy to understand explanations.</li>
<li>Has a lot of valuable content for such a short book!</li>
<li>Worth every penny you spend on it!</li>
</ol>

[expand title=&#8221;My Review&#8221; trigclass=&#8221;expandTitle&#8221; expanded=&#8221;true&#8221;]
In this volume, I found that the sections on the opening were a little harder to grasp. This is probably due to the fact that the nature of the opening is rather vast and thus trying to condense it down into a few pages is rather difficult. The forcing move section was also a little bit tough for me to really grab hold of as well. I imagine this is due to the fact that the whole concept of &#8220;timing&#8221; in go is not so easily summed up in a few pages. On the other hand though, I was very impressed by the sections regarding weak groups. And in my opinion, those two sections make the entire book worth purchasing.<br />
