				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For those who haven&#8217;t heard the news, I am super excited to inform you about <a href="http://gogameguru.com/new-affordable-go-equipment/">GoGameGuru&#8217;s announcement on introducing new and affordable go equipment</a>!! As an avid go enthusiast who is constantly checking local stores and online retailers for go equipment, it is really exciting to see GoGameGuru fill a niche of go equipment that I think is desperately lacking right now. Here are the featured products that are coming to GoGameGuru:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2013/10/ggg-new-products.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-4241" alt="ggg new products" src="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2013/10/ggg-new-products.jpg?resize=561%2C436" width="561" height="436" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<ol>
<li><a href="http://shop.gogameguru.com/folding-go-board/">Foldable Go Board</a> &#8211; At $25 for a very beautiful looking foldable go board, this is probably the product I&#8217;m most excited about since I have been unsuccessful in locating a nice quality foldable go board for me to bring with me wherever I go.</li>
<li><a href="http://shop.gogameguru.com/dirt-cheap-go-set/">Dirt Cheap Go Set</a> &#8211; It&#8217;s currently on sale for $9.99, but even it&#8217;s regular price of $14.99 is an ABSOLUTE STEAL when it comes to the fact you are getting a full size plastic go board along with stones and bowls! It doesn&#8217;t get much better than this if you are looking to start your own go club and want to have enough equipment without breaking the bank.</li>
<li><a href="http://shop.gogameguru.com/plastic-biconvex-stones-go-set/">Featherweight Go Set</a> &#8211; This is on sale for $19.99 (regular price $25.00) and seems to be an upgraded version of the <a href="http://shop.gogameguru.com/dirt-cheap-go-set/">Dirt Cheap Go Set</a>. Looks pretty sweet based on the pictures!</li>
<li><a href="http://shop.gogameguru.com/go-stones/">Go Stone Sample Packs</a> &#8211; Priced around $10 each, they also offer you a chance to purchase a sample pack of stones for you to check out before choosing to finally invest in the full set! And if you&#8217;re wondering why this is so cool, the sample packs are primarily slate and shell stones. xD</li>
</ol>
<p>With that said and done, I want to inform all of you that I will be purchasing all of these products and will be reviewing them as soon as I get them. So you can expect to see some changes coming to the Equipment Review section in preparation for these awesome products.</p>
