<p>When I woke up, I realized that today was the last day of Congress. Man, where had all the time gone? It seemed like just yesterday I boarded the train with my brother to embark on an epic journey to New York.<br />
The morning consisted of grabbing breakfast and checking out this cool place called <a title="The High Line" href="http://www.thehighline.org/">The High Line</a> that Anders recommended the night before. Luckily for us, it was still beautiful weather so we had a great time exploring the sights.<br />
<a href="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/10/2014GC-D07-02.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5829" src="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/10/2014GC-D07-02.jpg?resize=600%2C800" alt="2014GC-D07-02" width="600" height="800" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><br />
Around lunch, I got a call from Myung letting me know that Jung, Evan, Mark, and him wanted to try a steakhouse in NY before they left. So after meeting up with them at the hotel, we went off to look for one. We found one not too far: <a title="Wolfgang's Steakhouse Yelp" href="http://www.yelp.com/menu/wolfgangs-steakhouse-manhattan-3">Wolfgang Steakhouse</a>.<br />
<span id="more-5816"></span><br />
One of the items that caught my eye on the menu was a $200 steak (to be shared by 4 people). We had five people though, so I didn’t suggest it. Instead everyone went with their Wolfgang’s Steakhouse from their lunch menu.<br />
<figure id="attachment_5819" style="width: 800px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/10/2014GC-D07-04.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-5819" src="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/10/2014GC-D07-04.jpg?resize=720%2C540" alt="Look at the size of that thing!" width="720" height="540" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Look at the size of that thing! And they really got the medium rare down perfectly!</figcaption></figure>
To be honest, I was expecting to get a small piece of steak for the $30 we were paying, but it was HUGE! And though you don&#8217;t see any sides in this picture, there was large sides of mashed potatoes and spinach for everyone to share. To say the least, everyone was very satisfied with lunch. Haha.<br />
After being stuffed with a delicious lunch, Myung had to go attend to some matters; so I was left in charge of helping to guide the rest of the group around New York. So for the rest of the afternoon, we explored Time Square and had a lot of fun seeing all the fun things going on in the city.<br />
Soon it was time for us to return for the awards banquet though. And when we arrived, everyone went to their respective rooms to get ready (except for me). As I looked around for everyone, I noticed that Satoru wasn’t present. Unfortunately, I found out that he had already left and thus we would be unable to say goodbye in person. Nonetheless, it was great seeing him and I certainly hope to see him again in the near future!<br />
Finally it was time for us to enter the banquet hall.<br />
<a href="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/10/2014GC-D07-06.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5820" src="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/10/2014GC-D07-06.jpg?resize=600%2C800" alt="2014GC-D07-06" width="600" height="800" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><br />
<a href="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/10/2014GC-D07-08.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5822" src="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/10/2014GC-D07-08.jpg?resize=600%2C800" alt="2014GC-D07-08" width="600" height="800" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><br />
<img class="aligncenter wp-image-5821 size-full" src="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/10/2014GC-D07-07.jpg?resize=720%2C540" alt="2014GC-D07-07" width="720" height="540" data-recalc-dims="1" /><br />
The menu consisted of pasta with cheese and tomato sauce, chicken fingers, cookies, brownies, bread and drinks. Considering the places I had been eating the entire week, I have to admit I was a little disappointed. However, I just want to stress that I understand that we were primarily paying for the space and not for a top notch meal. So while I was a little disappointed, it was just a personal feeling at the time and not some reflection on the event itself.<br />
<a href="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/10/2014GC-D07-09.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5823" src="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/10/2014GC-D07-09.jpg?resize=720%2C540" alt="2014GC-D07-09" width="720" height="540" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><br />
The awards ceremony was fun though. For a summary of friends who placed:</p>
<ul>
<li>Diego and Terri both placed second in their respective divisions!</li>
<li>Mark Lee went undefeated and won 1st place!</li>
</ul>
<p>A huge congratulations to them on an awesome performance!<br />
Once all the awards had been announced, I realized that this would probably be the last time I would have a chance to talk to the professionals and went to say my final goodbyes and get some pictures taken with them.<br />

<p>Today was the official rest day for Congress. In other words, this meant that there would be no tournament matches so that people could go and explore New York if they wanted. As you might suspect though, there was a group of people who were here for go and just that alone. So in honor of these dedicated players, they had a “Die Hard Tournament” for these players.<br />
When I arrived at Hotel Pennsylvania, I found Nate and the gang hanging out.<br />
<a href="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/09/2014GC-D04-01.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5716" src="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/09/2014GC-D04-01.jpg?resize=720%2C540" alt="2014GC-D04-01" width="720" height="540" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><br />
<span id="more-5710"></span><br />
They seemed to have various plans for the day, so my brother and I decided to head out to try this soup dumpling place that he had been telling me about. Just as we were waiting for the metro to come however, I got a call from Myung inviting us for lunch. Doesn’t take a genius to guess what we did right? We hightailed it right out of the metro and went to meet up with Myung.<br />
When we arrived in Koreatown, we found Myung, Evan Cho (who was a strong amateur dan player that I had heard Myung talk about numerous times), and Mark Lee (who was another strong amateur from Korea). Both Evan and Mark were participating in the Master’s Tournament for Congress (which was reserved essentially for 5d and higher). So we talked a little about that and proceeded with the normal introductions and conversation.<br />
The food at the restaurant was traditional and authentic Korean food. And by that I mean we didn’t just eat Korean BBQ, but actual dishes that Korean people would normally eat at home or at a typical sit down restaurant. Apparently beef is pretty expensive in Korea. So while some of us would like to dream that every restaurant in Korea is just Korean BBQ, that is not the case. Haha.<br />
After finishing a delicious lunch, my brother and I planned go with Myung, Evan, and Mark one of the popular museums in New York (I can’t remember which); but after some time projections, we realized that we wouldn’t have time to go to the museum and also get my brother back in time to Penn Station. So we parted ways with them and headed off to let my brother get his things together.<br />
When the time came for him to leave, I have to admit I was a little sad to see my brother go. It might be some older brother instinct, but I had a great time hanging with him in NY and felt a little anxious watching him board the train on his own. I know I know… the guy is in his early 20’s, but I don’t think I’ll ever stop looking out for him. Haha.<br />
To get my mind off whether or not he’d be okay taking the train back on his own, I went back to Hotel Pennsylvania to see what everyone was up to. As I walked into the lobby, a little serendipity to have been in play because I ran into Michael as he was heading out. For those who don’t know, he was only able to stay for half the Congress, so I was really happy to be able to catch him before he left.<br />
<a href="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/09/2014GC-D04-02.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5717" src="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/09/2014GC-D04-02.jpg?resize=600%2C800" alt="2014GC-D04-02" width="600" height="800" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><br />
When I got to the top floor, I remember that I couldn’t really find anyone. It seemed everyone had headed off to do their own thing, so I sat down with my laptop and started working on some things. Sometime later, fellow UMBC alumni Nathan Epstein (henceforth referred to as Nathan and is not to be confused with Nate Eagle) came over to chat.<br />
In the midst of talking about the tournament and my withdrawal from the tournament, he pulled out this dice that he had gotten from one of the teaching seminars.<br />
<figure id="attachment_5719" style="width: 600px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/09/2014GC-D04-04.jpg"><img class="wp-image-5719 size-full" src="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/09/2014GC-D04-04.jpg?resize=600%2C800" alt="asdf" width="600" height="800" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">(Current side) One-space jump, (Bottom side) Large knight move, (Other sides) Small knight move, Diagonal, Two-space jump, Large diagonal move (i.e., elephant jump)</figcaption></figure>
Apparently this was a teaching apparatus for helping teach players about haengma (i.e., stone movement) and shape. So when he asked me if I wanted to try playing a game, I couldn’t refuse! For those who are wondering how this variant of go works, the rules are pretty simple:</p>
<ol>
<li>Start with a cross-fuseki formation with stones on the star points for both players.</li>
<li>Black goes first.</li>
<li>Player rolls the die.</li>
<li>Based on the haengma that shows up, you can use any stone of the board to move according to that haengma.</li>
<li>After player makes his move, the other player takes his turn.</li>
</ol>
<p>Though it took a little getting used to, I actually really enjoyed playing it and hope to play it again. And if anyone knows anyone selling those die, please be sure to let me know!<br />
After that fun game, I headed out for the remainder of the day since my girlfriend was arriving in town. And with that, the first half of Go Congress had come and gone. Tomorrow, the start of the second half of Go Congress!</p>
