It was a beautiful Saturday morning when I pulled up to the <a title="40th Maryland Open — Go Tournament!" href="//40th-maryland-open-go-tournament/">Maryland Open</a> in Catonsville, Maryland. Though I was a little nervous for what was waiting for me at this tournament, I was excited at the prospect of seeing friends and having a day filled with go.<br />
<span id="more-2803"></span><br />
After registering (as AGA 5k) and catching up with a few people, I noticed that a girl (whom I&#8217;d never seen before) come up to the registration table to purchase the books she had in hand (two Elementary Go Series books).</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Wait. There are go books on sale here?!</em></p>
<figure id="attachment_2806" style="width: 300px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2013/05/roadrunner.gif"><img class=" wp-image-2806 " alt="Credit to Tumblr" src="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2013/05/roadrunner.gif?resize=300%2C226" width="300" height="226" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Credit to <a href="http://www.tumblr.com/tagged/road%20runner">Tumblr</a></figcaption></figure>
When I found the section of go books for sale, I couldn&#8217;t believe my eyes as I stared at possibly the largest collection and variety of go books I had ever seen all in one place&#8230; It was like I was a kid in a candy store.<br />
<figure id="attachment_2822" style="width: 300px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2013/05/kermitexcited.gif"><img class=" wp-image-2822 " alt="Credit to Tumblr" src="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2013/05/kermitexcited.gif?resize=300%2C162" width="300" height="162" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Credit to <a href="http://www.tumblr.com/tagged/excited%20gif">Tumblr</a></figcaption></figure>
It&#8217;s safe to say that I spent the next 20 minutes or so perusing over just about every book I&#8217;d ever been remotely interested in. Granted, I&#8217;m trying to be better about spending money on go; but all of that went to hell when I found books that were out of print. With some restraint, I ended up only purchasing:</p>
<ol>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="line-height: 13px;">Improve Your Intuition, Volume 3</span></span></li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The ABC&#8217;s of Attack and Defense</span></li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Cosmic Go</span> (Not out of print but I liked the writing style and decided to get it to further my study of handicap go)</li>
</ol>
<p>Once I was finished buying my books, I returned to socializing with my friends since I knew that spending any more time in the book section would probably result in me buying more books. Shortly after though, the pairings were up and it was time the first round of the day.<br />
As my opponent and I sat across from one another, I saw him pull out his Bose headphones in preparation for the game. In the past, I had never considered listening to music while playing go; but I decided right there and then that I would give it a shot as well. Here&#8217;s the game from the first round.<a href="//wp-content/uploads/2013/05/2013-05-25-MD-Open-2013-Game-1.sgf"><br />

<p>After that intense match, we all headed out for lunch at a nearby Korean supermarket. I got sushi and enjoyed someone&#8217;s miso soup while we talked all sorts of interesting topics (e.g., Steven&#8217;s experience in Japan with shabu-shabu, the metro station in Japan, etc.).  Before I knew it though, it was time for the second round. The only problem was that my opponent was nowhere to be found.<br />
At this time, I was actually quite comfortable with the idea of my opponent not showing. The first round had given me a lot to think about and I was happy to simply watch other games instead of playing. Sure enough though, about ten minutes later my opponent came in ready to play. Here is the game record for the second round.<a href="//wp-content/uploads/2013/05/2013-05-25-MD-Open-2013-Game-2.sgf"><br />

<p>Unfortunately, I was unable to stay in the third round or attend the second day of the tournament, so my story ends here. However, even though I would have been curious to see how I would have done in the tournament, it was a fun filled day where I got to meet a lot of great people and play some great go. No regrets on my part. =)<br />
Big shoutout to Eulerstotl, Yuki, Steven, Gurujeet, Todd, Keith, Josh and Justin! It was great seeing you all there!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Introduction</strong> &#8212; <a title="North American Go Convention — Day 1" href="//north-american-go-convention-day-1/">Day 1</a> &#8212; <a title="North American Go Convention — Day 2" href="//north-american-go-convention-day-2/">Day 2</a> &#8212; <a title="North American Go Convention — Day 3" href="//north-american-go-convention-day-3/">Day 3</a> &#8212; <a title="North American Go Convention — Day 4" href="//north-american-go-convention-day-4/">Day 4</a> &#8212; <a title="North American Go Convention — Day 5" href="//north-american-go-convention-day-5/">Day 5</a> &#8212; <a title="North American Go Convention — Conclusion" href="//north-american-go-convention-conclusion/">Conclusion</a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Big announcement everyone! I am ecstatic to tell you about a brand new go event coming to the East coast!</strong></p>
<h1 style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2012/11/nagc.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1179" title="North American Go Convention Logo" alt="North American Go Convention Logo" src="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2012/11/nagc.jpg?resize=240%2C100" width="240" height="100" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></h1>
<h1 style="text-align: center;"><a title="North American Go Convention" href="http://www.ngol.us/">North American Go Convention 2013 (NAGC)</a></h1>
<p>Here is a high level overview of all the exciting things you can expect:</p>
<ol>
<li>Game review sessions with professionals!</li>
<li>Simultaneous games with professionals!</li>
<li>Lectures from professionals!</li>
<li>Multiple open tournaments for players of all ranks that are AGA rated and can be up to 23 rounds for kyu players and 17 rounds for dan players!</li>
<li>Pair Go (Rengo)</li>
<li>Blitz Go</li>
<li>Lots of awards!!!</li>
<li><a title="NAGC Features" href="http://www.ngol.us/nagc/nagc-introduction">And more more more!!!</a></li>
</ol>
<p>So if you&#8217;re even thinking about possibly going, go ahead and pre-register <a title="NAGC Online Registration" href="http://www.ngol.us/nagc/online-registration">here</a> because there is no obligation to commit to anything but you will at least have your name down early on in case spots for simul games or reviews from pros become unavailable due to high demand (which you know is inevitable). So don&#8217;t hesitate and hurry up and go pre-register! I&#8217;m already pre-registered for Gold Access in DC, but I&#8217;d also be open to going to NJ as well if given enough persuasion!<br />
If you are going, be sure to let me know because I&#8217;ll definitely be there! Ahhhhh!!!! So exciting!!!!</p>
