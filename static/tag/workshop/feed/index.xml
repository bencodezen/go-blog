Last week, I had the pleasure of attending the 54th <a title="Sakura Matsuri Official Site" href="http://www.sakuramatsuri.org/">Sakura Matsuri Street Festival</a> in Washington D.C.! For those who don&#8217;t know, this is in conjunction with the annual <a title="Cherry Blossom Festival Official Site" href="http://www.nationalcherryblossomfestival.org/">Cherry Blossom Festival</a> that is held in D.C. every year and runs from 10:30AM to 6:30PM. And for a nominal fee of $10, you get entry into a street full of vendors, performances, cultural booths, and most importantly, the go booth!<br />
<span id="more-5096"></span><br />
<figure id="attachment_5098" style="width: 346px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014SakuraMatsuri-02.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-5098" alt="2014SakuraMatsuri-02" src="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014SakuraMatsuri-02.jpg?resize=346%2C461" width="346" height="461" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Though a bit blurry, you can get a sense of how crowded it was. Not for the claustrophobic!</figcaption></figure>
Making your way through the crowd was a bit of a challenge since people would randomly stop to look at things or be waiting in these long lines for food. So as you can expect, there were all sorts of random jams in the street. However, once you make your way past the main intersection, it didn&#8217;t take long before you found yourself before the go booth.<br />
<figure id="attachment_5099" style="width: 448px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014SakuraMatsuri-03.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-5099" alt="2014SakuraMatsuri-03" src="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014SakuraMatsuri-03.jpg?resize=448%2C448" width="448" height="448" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Here&#8217;s a shot of our booth from the main side.</figcaption></figure>
<figure id="attachment_5100" style="width: 448px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014SakuraMatsuri-04.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-5100" alt="2014SakuraMatsuri-04" src="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014SakuraMatsuri-04.jpg?resize=448%2C448" width="448" height="448" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Here&#8217;s a shot of the booth from the left side peering into the booth.</figcaption></figure>
I arrived a couple hours late, but as you can see in the shots above, things were quite busy! Even though we had around 8-10 teachers, you can see that everyone is busy teaching. Definitely something I was ecstatic to see as a go enthusiast.<br />
<figure id="attachment_5101" style="width: 448px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014SakuraMatsuri-05.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-5101" alt="2014SakuraMatsuri-05" src="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014SakuraMatsuri-05.jpg?resize=448%2C448" width="448" height="448" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Pictured: Myself (center), John (with the hat) and Justin Teng (red jacket)</figcaption></figure>
The shot above is of me after I got settled and teaching my first customer of the day. As you can see on the board, we&#8217;re playing a game of first capture!<br />
<figure id="attachment_5102" style="width: 384px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014SakuraMatsuri-06.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-5102" alt="2014SakuraMatsuri-06" src="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014SakuraMatsuri-06.jpg?resize=384%2C512" width="384" height="512" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">The brochure that we were handing out.</figcaption></figure>
Though we had quite a few brochures printed out (I think more than 200) and had a few pamphlets, I was quite surprised that we had so many people asking for more information that we were running out before 3:00PM had even came around. Definitely a lesson learned for next year!<br />
<figure id="attachment_5103" style="width: 448px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014SakuraMatsuri-07.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-5103" alt="2014SakuraMatsuri-07" src="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014SakuraMatsuri-07-1024x976.jpg?resize=448%2C427" width="448" height="427" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Another shot of us busy at work teaching the never ending crowd of people looking to sit down and have a shot to learn themselves!</figcaption></figure>
After I sat down to start teaching, I have to say that everything was moving at such a fast pace. First, all the students I taught learned at a quick pace and grasped the game pretty quickly. Secondly, there were no shortage of spectators who were paying close attention to what was being taught so they could learn about it themselves. And to my surprise and delight, every time a seat opened up, there was always someone ready to sit down and try their hand at it.<br />
<figure id="attachment_5104" style="width: 384px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014SakuraMatsuri-08.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-5104" alt="2014SakuraMatsuri-08" src="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014SakuraMatsuri-08.jpg?resize=384%2C512" width="384" height="512" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Here&#8217;s a shot of me trying to switch between four different simultaneous teaching games. For  the tech nerds, one of my customers had Google Glasses on! How awesome is that?!</figcaption></figure>
Eventually, things got so busy that I was simultaneously teaching around 2-3 people at a time on average. To streamline the process a bit, I figured out that having everyone to focus on one board while I explained the rules worked out really well. And then when they had an idea what was going on, I would give them their own boards and stones and play simul games with all of them so that they were all equally engaged.<br />
<figure id="attachment_5105" style="width: 384px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014SakuraMatsuri-09.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-5105" alt="2014SakuraMatsuri-09" src="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014SakuraMatsuri-09.jpg?resize=384%2C512" width="384" height="512" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Here&#8217;s a shot of me in my 4 way simul teaching game. But as you notice in the background, the streets are seriously packed and all the teachers are busy teaching.</figcaption></figure>
All in all, the event was a huge success and I felt that a lot of people were able to be exposed to go and learn about it. The only real lesson learned from this event, however, is that we definitely needed a  surplus of marketing material. It would have definitely been nice if we could have handed out more brochures more aggressively without worrying about our inventory.<br />
Finally, the thing that was really great to see what that a majority of the people I taught asked me for more information (for which I promptly gave them my blog and email) and if we even had any go sets to purchase (which we unfortunately did not have and is something I want to look into next year).<br />
So for all those who have any Japanese cultural events in your local area, I definitely encourage you all to try and setup a booth like we did. Because at the end of the day, if there was only one thing I learned from this event, it is that go has a real potential to appeal to all types of people and can eventually become a household staple like chess or checkers if we keep spreading the word with outreach initiatives like this one.<br />
<span style="text-align: center; line-height: 1.5em;">Many thanks to John Goon for coordinating and setting up this event. Definitely looking forward to it next year! </span></p>

<p style="text-align: left;">Some of you already know, but I went to one of the local malls and volunteered to teach go for the Chinese New Year 2014 celebration. As you can see in the little collage I put together above, there were nice decorations along with performances in the center of the mall. Definitely felt like Chinese New Year! Haha. And of course, how could you have a Chinese New Year celebration without go? (I might be a little biased though xD)</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span id="more-4623"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">When I got there around 2pm, they had already finished setting up the booth. We had one large 9&#215;9 demo board, a 13&#215;13/19&#215;19 board, and  multiple beginner boards for new players.</p>
<figure id="attachment_4625" style="width: 420px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/02/2014chinesenewyearmall02.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-4625" alt="2014chinesenewyearmall02" src="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/02/2014chinesenewyearmall02.jpg?resize=420%2C265" width="420" height="265" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">This was a little later in the day, but you get the idea!</figcaption></figure>
<p style="text-align: left;">At each section of the table, we had multiple brochures along with &#8220;The Way of Go&#8221; booklets for anyone who showed any interest.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/02/2014chinesenewyearmall03.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-4626" alt="2014chinesenewyearmall03" src="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/02/2014chinesenewyearmall03.jpg?resize=420%2C315" width="420" height="315" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">There weren&#8217;t too many people at first, so I got the opportunity to finally meet fellow local go player Kevin (seen below) and play a game with him. (Right before we started playing, I found out that he was 5 dan. Hyuk hyuk hyuk&#8230;)</p>
<figure id="attachment_4627" style="width: 420px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/02/2014chinesenewyearmall04.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-4627" alt="2014chinesenewyearmall04" src="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/02/2014chinesenewyearmall04.jpg?resize=420%2C315" width="420" height="315" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Let the games begin!</figcaption></figure>
<p style="text-align: left;">The following is a kifu I recreated from memory later on that day. Other than one move (which I&#8217;m not 100% sure of, but I am 100% sure of the purpose behind it), this record is accurate and contains some pointers from when we review some of the game later on.<a href="//wp-content/uploads/2014/02/2014.02.08-Lakeforest-Chinese-New-Year.sgf"><br />

<p>After the game, more people began showing up and we started teaching first capture and the rules to everyone. My big customer of the day was a little girl who was about 5. We played a couple games of first capture that went well, and it seemed like she had fun. =)<br />
<figure id="attachment_4628" style="width: 360px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/02/2014chinesenewyearmall05.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-4628" alt="2014chinesenewyearmall05" src="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/02/2014chinesenewyearmall05.jpg?resize=360%2C480" width="360" height="480" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Here&#8217;s a shot of her and her mom. They were both engaged and picked up on concepts like liberties and capturing stones really quickly!</figcaption></figure>
<p style="text-align: left;">Later on in the day, Kevin and I sat down to review our game. You can see his comments in the kifu above, but overall it was a great learning experience and eye-opening.</p>
<figure id="attachment_4629" style="width: 420px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/02/2014chinesenewyearmall06.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-4629" alt="2014chinesenewyearmall06" src="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/02/2014chinesenewyearmall06.jpg?resize=420%2C315" width="420" height="315" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Here&#8217;s us going over the lower left corner variations.</figcaption></figure>
<figure id="attachment_4630" style="width: 315px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/02/2014chinesenewyearmall07.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-4630" alt="2014chinesenewyearmall07" src="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/02/2014chinesenewyearmall07.jpg?resize=315%2C420" width="315" height="420" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">After kneeling on the ground for a while (teaching the little girl go), I needed a break and stood while Kevin talked about how he was surprised that I cut so quickly in the upper right corner.</figcaption></figure>
<p style="text-align: left;">Towards the latter half of the workshop, my family showed up to show their support! Haha. It was really kind of them and it was great having them there. In the shot below, you&#8217;ll see my dad and my brother playing an intense game of Connect 5 (which is probably the simplest version of &#8220;go&#8221; that exists).</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/02/2014chinesenewyearmall08.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-4631" alt="2014chinesenewyearmall08" src="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/02/2014chinesenewyearmall08.jpg?resize=420%2C315" width="420" height="315" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Here are some group shots of the volunteers.</p>
<figure id="attachment_4632" style="width: 450px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/02/2014chinesenewyearmall09.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-4632" alt="2014chinesenewyearmall09" src="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/02/2014chinesenewyearmall09.jpg?resize=450%2C600" width="450" height="600" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Pictured: Me (left) and Kevin (right)</figcaption></figure>

Considering we weren&#8217;t in an ideal location in the mall, I thought the foot traffic we got was still pretty great and we had a number of interested people stop by to play and ask questions. Definitely a success in my book! It&#8217;s definitely got me thinking about doing more things like this in the future. Will be sure to add it to my long list of things to do. Haha. Hope you all enjoyed this post!<br />

<ul>
<li>A mid-high SDK (single digit kyu) who has read his fair share of books and has a decent foundation of most areas in go.</li>

<p><strong>My Perspective</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Since these are written to be more of a &#8220;workshop&#8221; format, I was looking forward to a new style of writing along with a refreshing perspective on some common questions that most players might have.</li>

[expand title=&#8221;Synopsis&#8221; trigclass=&#8221;expandTitle&#8221;]
<strong>What did I enjoy about the book?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>As usual, Yang continues to breakdown topics into simple explanations that I could easily understand.</li>
<li>I really enjoy the fact that he takes on topics that go literature tends to overlook for amateurs. An example of this is &#8220;Handling Unusual Opening Moves.&#8221;</li>
<li>The diagrams are short and quite easy to follow.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What did I gain from reading this book?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Improved ability to recognize what areas on the board are important and big.</li>
<li>Better understanding of how to determine what my next move should be in the opening.</li>
<li>Much clearer direction in regards to how one should handle unusual opening moves.</li>
<li>An improved grasp on how I should protect my positions on the board.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What style of teaching does the book use?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Similar to his previous books in this series, the teaching format primarily consists of explanations regarding the topic at hand in conjunction with diagrams that have the reader test his/her ability. Then, after the problem is given, Yang typically goes into an extensive (but simple to understand) explanation of the various things the reader should consider when approaching the problem.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What aspect can be improved on?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>No complaints from me!</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Is this book easy to read?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Yes. The explanations are concise and the accompanying diagrams are often no more than a few moves long.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Bottom Line</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Breaks down topics into easy to understand explanations.</li>
<li>Has a lot of valuable content for such a short book!</li>
<li>Worth every penny you spend on it!</li>

[expand title=&#8221;My Review&#8221; trigclass=&#8221;expandTitle&#8221; expanded=&#8221;true&#8221;]
The topics that are covered in this book are incredibly useful to many players (particularly kyu level players). Though I am still far from being able to implement his advice flawlessly, I am still blown away by Yang&#8217;s ability to take common topics that plague weaker players and convey them in a manner that we can understand without boring us to death. So if you have any interest in the topics covered in this volume, be sure to pick up a copy!<br />

<strong>What did I enjoy about the book?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>As usual, Yang continues to breakdown topics into simple explanations that I could easily understand.</li>
<li>The topics are extremely relevant to the average player since a majority of go literature assumes that the reader is already familiar and well versed in these basic concepts.</li>
<li>Yang usually has a checklist of questions for each section to remind the reader of the important things to remember.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What did I gain from reading this book?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A much better understanding of how to evaluate whether a group is weak or not.</li>
<li>Better grasp on what forcing moves are. Though applying it is still rather hazy for me.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What style of teaching does the book use?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Workshop Format
<ul>
<li>Topics of broken down into its simplest format and represents more of an outline than a thorough textbook.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Primary Learning Mechanism:
<ul>
<li>Explanations with accompanying diagrams</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Other Learning Mechanisms:
<ul>
<li>Practice problems</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What aspect can be improved on?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Though the examples can be helpful, I found that they slightly overwhelming after some time since I am still having issues actually understanding the concept solidly. A good example of this is whether or not a forcing move is good or bad. I have a general idea, but that&#8217;s all. So before I get into the weeds of how to use it, it would have been better to have more basic practice questions.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Is this book easy to read?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Yes. The explanations are concise and the accompanying diagrams are often no more than a few moves long.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Bottom Line</strong></p>

[expand title=&#8221;My Review&#8221; trigclass=&#8221;expandTitle&#8221; expanded=&#8221;true&#8221;]
In this volume, I found that the sections on the opening were a little harder to grasp. This is probably due to the fact that the nature of the opening is rather vast and thus trying to condense it down into a few pages is rather difficult. The forcing move section was also a little bit tough for me to really grab hold of as well. I imagine this is due to the fact that the whole concept of &#8220;timing&#8221; in go is not so easily summed up in a few pages. On the other hand though, I was very impressed by the sections regarding weak groups. And in my opinion, those two sections make the entire book worth purchasing.<br />

[expand title=&#8221;My Review&#8221; trigclass=&#8221;expandTitle&#8221; expanded=&#8221;true&#8221;]
This was a refreshing perspective on common go questions. Yilun Yang&#8217;s ability to break down popular topics like &#8220;Determining What Direction to Attack&#8221; was incredibly easy to understand. Contrary to some typical go literature where the concept is explained to death, Yang provides more of a road map on how to actually apply the principle instead of simply understanding it. Now granted, I will be the first to say that actually applying it to your game is not so easy; but my understanding has certainly grown and I am now trying out new things as a result. I am really looking forward to the next books in the series!<br />

We started off with a life and death problem that is called &#8220;hunting the 6 stone bird.&#8221; Apparently it&#8217;s a very old problem that has been around for a long time, for those wondering what the shape looks like. For those who would like to try it out for themselves, here it is below:<br />

Afterwards, I got to hear a very captivating  review for one of <a title="Lee Chang Ho's Page" href="http://senseis.xmp.net/?YiChangHo">Lee Changho</a> 9p Vs. <a title="Park Jung Hwan's Page" href="http://senseis.xmp.net/?ParkJungHwan">Park Junghwan</a> 9p games in the most recent Ing Cup World Go Championship. It was one that was full of full of suspense, excitement, and a capturing battle on epic proportions that made Park Junghwan the decisive victor.<br />
As I listened to Yuan Zhou review the game, there were a few things that really struck me:<br />
<span id="more-1650"></span></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Professionals pay particular attention to their weak groups</strong>. They almost never let a weak group go unattended for more than a move or two.</li>
<li><strong>Professionals never play follow the leader.</strong> They try to figure out what their opponent is trying to do, and then usually come up with a move to interrupt the flow of their opponent&#8217;s game.</li>
<li><strong>Professional games tend to steer away from killing groups.</strong> The reasons lies in the fact that it is very difficult to kill a group and you usually end up sacrificing a lot of points in the process of attempting to do so.</li>
</ol>
<p>In addition, one of the biggest takeaways I had from the entire workshop is <strong>how incredibly important life and death is</strong>. I mean, sure, we all know that life and death is &#8220;important,&#8221; but I think that most players brush it off as a tedious chore that gets in the way of their game. And while I will be sure to write an article further detailing my new found appreciation for life and death, I leave you with this thought: Imagine the possibilities if you could live wherever you invaded/reduced. Wouldn&#8217;t every game become far more simpler?<br />
After the review, we had lunch and played a game with one another. As I looked back on my game, I believe that the reverse komi (-7.5 points) caused my opponent to take more risks than he needed to. In addition, our ranks are most likely about equal, so I believe that the game was rather lopsided to begin with. With that in mind, I do think that my play overall was rather poor and still shows a lack of my attention to the fundamentals of strong players.<br />

After many months of almost going and then not being able to, I am happy to report that I finally made it out to one of <a title="Yuan Zhou Website" href="http://zhouyuan.com/">Yuan Zhou</a>&#8216;s monthly workshops. This post is slightly overdue since I went to the November one; but it comes at a right time since the December workshop is right around the corner!<br />
For those who have never been to a go workshop, here&#8217;s a high level overview of what you might find:</p>
<ul>
<li>In depth review of a game (usually a professional one)</li>
<li>One round of games (with a main time around 45 minutes)</li>
<li>Game reviews for the games that were just played</li>
</ul>
<p>As I arrived at Yuan Zhou&#8217;s house, I nostalgically recalled the two lessons that I had taken with him in the past. They seemed so long ago, but I was glad that I was finally back to seriously study the game. As I walked towards the entrance, I felt a little apprehensive as I wondered whether I would be able to gain anything from this workshop since I am so weak; but before I could have any serious doubts, I was greeted by Yuan Zhou and welcomed inside.<br />
I was happy to see that Nate had already arrived, and promptly sat myself next to him as I was told to work on the life and death problem on the board. As we sat there staring at the board, Nate made a comment that made me laugh,</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Two years after Shifu told me someone named Ben might be coming who was close to my level, you&#8217;ve finally managed to show up.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>After everyone had arrived, it was time to see if the students had figured it out. As luck would have it, since I was the weakest player there, I was to give the first response. Recently, I had been exposed to some of the quirkier life and death problems that required atypical moves just as making the empty triangle descent and such; so I ended up choosing that move even though I couldn&#8217;t quite see the end of the sequence. Sure enough. I was wrong. Haha. Eventually a stronger player gave the right answer, and so we finished up the explanation and moved on to the review of the professional game.<br />
The game we were reviewing was one of <a title="Ishida Yoshio Wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoshio_Ishida">Ishida Yoshio</a> and <a title="Rin Kaiho Wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rin_Kaiho">Rin Kaiho</a>&#8216;s games from 1974. Before we even began looking at the kifu however, Yuan Zhou launched into a fascinating explanation of the history behind the game: <a title="Go Seigen Wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_Seigen">Go Seigen</a> &amp; <a title="Kitani Minoru Wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kitani_Minoru">Kitani Minoru</a>, the Super Six, the terse feelings of having a non-Japanese player hold both <a title="Meijin Wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meijin">Meijin</a> and <a title="Honinbo Wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honinbo">Honinbo</a> titles, and so on. While some may wonder how relevant this is to getting better, it is like a cultural tour of this game we all devote so much time to that many often overlook. And if you still aren&#8217;t convinced, knowing the history behind the entire game made for a much more exciting review since you have an understanding of the players and how high the stakes are.<br />
After the exciting game review, we had lunch and then proceeded with the afternoon game. Since we had an odd number of players, one of the players recorded my game while I had the opportunity to play. I felt kind of badly that I was playing and the player had to record, so in the future, I think that I would not mind being the recorder instead so other players can play instead. Anyhow, here&#8217;s the game record from that afternoon.<br />

<p>After all the games were finished, Yuan Zhou reviewed all of the games. If there&#8217;s something I learned from that experience, you tend to remember your lessons a lot better when other people are watching the review and seeing the mistakes you made. For example, the one thing that I will remember forever is the Elephant&#8217;s Eye (which I&#8217;ll write more on at another time). In addition, being able to have both sides of the game reviewed really helps to open you eyes as to what was supposed to work and what wasn&#8217;t supposed to work. On top of that, getting to see the game reviews for everyone else&#8217;s game was also very helpful.<br />
Although I started out skeptical of what I would gain from the workshop, I am now a huge fan of them. Since most of players will never have the opportunity to be an insei and study go at that level of intensity, I really feel that go workshops are like one day insei experiences. Everyone who attends is committing their time and money, and you can be sure that everyone wants to make the most out of it. In addition, they are spaced out in such a way that you don&#8217;t have to worry about information overload. In fact, that&#8217;s exactly what you want since the time apart from each workshop allows you to absorb and apply the things that you learned so that you will have new things to learn the next time around.<br />
I highly recommend Yuan Zhou&#8217;s workshops if you ever have the opportunity. The next workshop will be December 16th, 2012. If you&#8217;re interested in attending one of Yuan Zhou&#8217;s monthly workshops, contact him at <a href="mailto:yuan.zhou@zhouyuan.com">yuan.zhou@zhouyuan.com</a>. Hope to see you there one day!</p>
