				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 style="text-align: center;">Friday Go Forward: Week 56</h2>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>This week marked the start of April and thus the official countdown to <a title="US Go Congress Official Site" href="http://www.gocongress.org/">US Go Congress</a>! In addition, I am uber psyched to announce that I officially joined the <a title="Yunguseng Dojang Official Site" href="http://www.yunguseng.com/">Yunguseng Dojang</a> and will definitely be part of Season 9 2014! Even though it hasn&#8217;t started yet, since it&#8217;s a break month, I was able to get started on checking out some of the recorded material in there. And while I would love to rant on and on about it right now, I will keep it short and just say that there is a lot of great stuff waiting for me to discover.<br />
I think I have come up with a new training regimen for my training my tsumego and reading, but I haven&#8217;t finalized it yet so I&#8217;ll wait till next week to update the section with what I&#8217;m doing. And in terms of playing go, it has been a bit quieter this week, but I&#8217;m definitely hoping to get online and play a game soon! Hope you all are doing well and I&#8217;ll see you next week!</p>
<h2>Training Regimen</h2>
<ul>
<li><b>Reading Ability &#8211; </b>Work on the tasks below until whichever comes first.*
<ul>
<li>Work on go problems for 30 minutes.</li>
<li>Work on 300 go problems.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>*<em>This is a way to split the difference between task based versus time based training. If you work faster than normal, and can get through 300 (or whichever number you decide on) problems. Kudos to you. But in the event you&#8217;re having trouble and need more time to work on the problems, just keep at it until 30 minutes is up (or whatever time you think it best for you).</em></p>
<h2>Games</h2>
<ul>
<li><a title="KGS Website" href="http://www.gokgs.com/">KGS</a> &#8211;  2 games</li>
<li><a title="Dragon Go Server - BenGoZen's Profile" href="http://www.dragongoserver.net/userinfo.php?uid=60385">DGS</a> &#8211; 5 ongoing games</li>
<li><a title="Online Go Server - BenGoZen's Profile" href="http://online-go.com/user/view/549/BenGoZen">OGS</a> &#8211;  4 ongoing games</li>
</ul>
<h2>Books</h2>
<ul>
<li>Worked on <em>Life and Death Problems 1 &#8211; Basics</em> by Robert Jasiek.</li>
</ul>

<strong>My Abilities</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>I&#8217;ve studied my fair share of life and death and can confidently say that I have a SDK (single digit kyu) level of life and death.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>My Perspective</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>In general, I would say that I have always preferred learning through experience. Though in all honesty, after finishing the second volume, I was skeptical of how far I could really get in this book.</li>
</ul>
[/expand]
[expand title=&#8221;My Review&#8221; trigclass=&#8221;expandTitle&#8221; expanded=&#8221;true&#8221;]
<strong>What did I enjoy about the book?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Though my inability to progress very far was slightly depressing, I was happy to see that there was still a lot of room for me to grow and improve my life and death skills.</li>
<li>The drill seargent routine is great because I have multiple opportunities to get exposure to moves I would have never considered before.</li>
<li>There is a huge focus on shapes that players don&#8217;t normally study: rectangular six and 2-2-2. In addition, these shapes are dissected to a very detailed level. Example: Rectangular six with one outside liberty versus two liberties.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What did I gain from reading this book?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A broader perspective on the different variations that can arise from life and death postiions.</li>
<li>A better grasp on techniques used to either kill or save a group.</li>
<li>Moderate improvement in my reading abilities. (This is only due to the speed at which I was going through problems. Anyone who diligently studies each problem to mastery will most likely gain a significant boost to their reading ability).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What style of teaching does the book use?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Curriculum Style
<ul>
<li>Content is organized into lessons, topics, or themes in order to facilitate learning.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Teaching Mechanism:
<ul>
<li>Practice problems</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What aspect can be improved on?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>I felt that the problems got a lot more difficult very quickly. However, this should be taken with a grain of salt since there is a good chance that the reader is supposed to already have a more solid reading ability than I have before working on this book.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Is this book easy to read?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Yes. Unless you can&#8217;t read English, it really doesn&#8217;t get any simpler.</li>
</ul>

[expandsub1 title=&#8221;1001 Life and Death Problems&#8221; trigclass=&#8221;cBookTitle&#8221;]
Compared to <a title="Book Review: 1001 Life and Death Problems" href="//book-review-1001-life-and-death-problems/">1001 Life and Death Problems</a>, this series does a better job hand-holing players new to life and death through the basic shapes and variations. On the other hand, I would say that in terms of polishing a player&#8217;s life and death skills, 1001 Life and Death Problems is still highly recommended. So to clarify, neither one trumps the other. Both can provide great value to a player&#8217;s life and death abilities.<br />

[expandsub2 title=&#8221;Elementary Go Series, Volume 4 &#8211; Life and Death&#8221; trigclass=&#8221;cBookTitle&#8221;]
While <a title="Book Review: Life and Death" href="//book-review-life-and-death/">Life and Death</a> does a great job providing a broad survey of different shapes through explanations and accompanying practice problems, this series uses the &#8220;learn it through experience&#8221; methodology. Though they may overlap on a good deal of material, I believe that they complement one another and would both be of great use to serious players wanting to improve their life and death.<br />

[expand title=&#8221;My Review&#8221; trigclass=&#8221;expandTitle&#8221; expanded=&#8221;true&#8221;]
<strong>What did I enjoy about the book?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>It introduces the reader to the concept of good and bad shapes.</li>
<li>Starts training the reader to practice looking for important stones.</li>
<li>They do a great job introducing seki and offer lots of really simple but effective practice problems for it.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What did I gain from reading this book?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Polished my ability to distinguish between key stones in capturing races.</li>
<li>Started rebuilding my ability to see seki positions from the ground up.</li>
<li>Polished my abilities to use nets, shortage of liberties, ladders, and snapback.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What style of teaching does the book use?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Curriculum Style
<ul>
<li>Content is organized into lessons, topics, or themes in order to facilitate learning.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Primary Learning Mechanism:
<ul>
<li>Practice problems</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Other Learning Mechanisms:
<ul>
<li>Cute and entertaining comics to teach and/or reinforce lessons.</li>
<li>Simple explantations that are accompanied by equally simple diagrams.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What aspect(s) can be improved on?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>No complaints here. I was really happy with the progression of problems in this book.</li>
<li>Errata &#8211; Question #3 on page 51 &#8211; Black&#8217;s shape seems incorrect. The stones should form a solid triangle instead of the hanging connection.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Is this book easy to read?</strong></p>

<li>Yes. It was very easy to understand all the explanations and progress through the book.</li>

<li>Though the series is designed for kids, both kids and adults alike will be able to learn everything they need to know about playing go in a fun and entertaining way.</li>

<ol>
<li>You can expect the same quality of problems from the first volume.</li>
<li>A great way for players to drill their life and death skills.</li>
<li>Though I had a relatively easy time with the first volume, the problems in this book started to pose some difficulty for me.</li>

[/expand]
[expand title=&#8221;Before I Read This Book&#8230;&#8221; trigclass=&#8221;expandTitle&#8221;]
<strong>My Abilities</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>I&#8217;ve studied my fair share of life and death and can confidently say that I have a SDK (single digit kyu) level of life and death.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>My Perspective</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>After finishing the first volume, I was expecting this book to be rather easy to do as well.</li>
</ul>
[/expand]
[expand title=&#8221;My Review&#8221; trigclass=&#8221;expandTitle&#8221; expanded=&#8221;true&#8221;]
<strong>What did I enjoy about the book?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>They have no reservation in terms of making you drill the same concept repeatedly.</li>
<li>There are so many concepts and shapes in this book that makes it very valuable.</li>
<li>The review sections (e.g., quizzes) and tests do a great job helping you determine if you actually learned the lessons prior.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What did I gain from reading this book?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A broader perspective on the different variations that can arise from life and death postiions.</li>
<li>A better grasp on techniques used to either kill or save a group.</li>
<li>The problems in this book actually posed some difficulty for me at times. Being that this is the second book, it didn&#8217;t take long for me to realize how weak my life and death skills really are.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What style of teaching does the book use?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Curriculum Style
<ul>
<li>Content is organized into lessons, topics, or themes in order to facilitate learning.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Teaching Mechanism:
<ul>
<li>Practice problems</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What aspect can be improved on?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>If I had to request one thing, it&#8217;s that I was hoping that the difficulty of the problems would be more gradual. The difficulty of the problems increased faster than I was expecting. Though this should be taken with a grain of salt since I have a feeling this is just an indicator of how weak my reading abilities are instead of it being the book&#8217;s problem.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Is this book easy to read?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Yes. Unless you can&#8217;t read English, it really doesn&#8217;t get any simpler.</li>
</ul>

[expandsub1 title=&#8221;1001 Life and Death Problems&#8221; trigclass=&#8221;cBookTitle&#8221;]
Compared to <a title="Book Review: 1001 Life and Death Problems" href="//book-review-1001-life-and-death-problems/">1001 Life and Death Problems</a>, this series does a better job hand-holing players new to life and death through the basic shapes and variations. On the other hand, I would say that in terms of polishing a player&#8217;s life and death skills, 1001 Life and Death Problems is still highly recommended. So to clarify, neither one trumps the other. Both can provide great value to a player&#8217;s life and death abilities.<br />
[/expandsub1]
[expandsub2 title=&#8221;Elementary Go Series, Volume 4 &#8211; Life and Death&#8221; trigclass=&#8221;cBookTitle&#8221;]
While <a title="Book Review: Life and Death" href="//book-review-life-and-death/">Life and Death</a> does a great job providing a broad survey of different shapes through explanations and accompanying practice problems, this series uses the &#8220;learn it through experience&#8221; methodology. Though they may overlap on a good deal of material, I believe that they complement one another and would both be of great use to serious players wanting to improve their life and death.<br />

<li>Continues to live up to the quality of teaching material and practice problems that were in the first volume.</li>

<strong>My Abilities</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A mid to high SDK (single digit kyu) kyu who has read his fair share of go books and has a pretty strong foundation in the basics and teaching go.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>My Perspective</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>After reading <a title="Book Review: Level Up 1" href="//book-review-level-up-1/">Level Up 1</a>, I was just excited to get started on the second book and keep the momentum going!</li>
</ul>
[/expand]
[expand title=&#8221;My Review&#8221; trigclass=&#8221;expandTitle&#8221; expanded=&#8221;true&#8221;]
<strong>What did I enjoy about the book?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>It forces you to review (and inadvertently reinforce) what you learned in <a title="Book Review: Level Up 1" href="//book-review-level-up-1/">Level Up 1</a>.</li>
<li>Introduces life and death at its most fundamental level (i.e.,making your second eye) and drills the reader in finding it or taking it away.</li>
<li>Spends a lot of time on ladders and gives the reader lots of opportunity to practice reading simple ladders. This is one of my favorite parts about this book since ladders are something that most players tend to shy away from.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What did I gain from reading this book?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Polishing my ladder reading abilities.</li>
<li>Polishing my ability to accurately read out multiple variations since I&#8217;m double checking why the other answer doesn&#8217;t work.</li>
<li>Better understanding of how to break down concepts like ladders when teaching go to newer players.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What style of teaching does the book use?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Workbook Approach
<ul>
<li>There are less explanations and more problems in this book, but any reader who has diligently followed practiced the problems from <a title="Book Review: Level Up 1" href="//book-review-level-up-1/">Level Up 1</a> should have no issues solving the problems.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Primary Learning Mechanism
<ul>
<li>Solving problems.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Other Learning Mechanisms
<ul>
<li>Cute comics to illustrate concepts like, &#8220;Before capturing your opponent, look at your own weak points.&#8221;</li>
<li>Multiple choice questions such as,&#8221; Who has made better territory?&#8221;</li>
<li>Kifus (i.e., game records) that are only around 10 moves long with short one line statements of the move&#8217;s purpose.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What aspects can be improved on?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The concept of chokchoksu (which is essentially shortage of liberties) should be introduced earlier on since there are a number of problems that use it in the solution.</li>
<li>The answer book for Question #2 for page 163 should be &#8220;net.&#8221;</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Is this book easy to read?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Yes. It was very easy to progress through the book.</li>
</ul>
[/expand]
[expand title=&#8221;Recommended For&#8230;&#8221; trigclass=&#8221;expandTitle&#8221;]
<ul>
<li>Though the series is designed for kids, both kids and adults alike will be able to learn everything they need to know about playing go in a fun and entertaining way.</li>
<li>People who enjoy learning things in an easy to understand format and lots of opportunities to reinforce what they are learning.</li>

[expand title=&#8221;Synopsis&#8221; trigclass=&#8221;expandTitle&#8221; expanded=&#8221;true&#8221;]
<ol>
<li>The best introductory book that I have encountered thus far.</li>
<li>Imagine one of those practice workbooks you used to have in school, except about go.</li>
<li>Does a fantastic job giving the reader lots of opportunity to reinforce the concepts they learn.</li>
</ol>

[expand title=&#8221;Before I Read This Book&#8230;&#8221; trigclass=&#8221;expandTitle&#8221;]
<strong>My Abilities</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A 5 kyu who has read his fair share of go books and has a pretty strong foundation in the basics and teaching go.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>My Perspective</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>I was looking for a series that could fill the missing niche of breaking down concepts in an easy to understand manner while giving lots of opportunity to practice what they just learned.</li>
</ul>
[/expand]
[expand title=&#8221;My Review&#8221; trigclass=&#8221;expandTitle&#8221; expanded=&#8221;true&#8221;]
<strong>What did I enjoy about the book?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The diagrams and explanations are very simple and very easy to follow, which is ideal for new players.</li>
<li>There are lots of opportunity to reinforce the concept being taught regardless of how &#8220;easy&#8221; it is.</li>
<li>It is very evident that a lot of effort went into structuring the content like a curriculum so that it builds upon previous concepts as the reader progresses.</li>
<li>They do a great job with acclimating the reader to more complicated diagrams. For example, the first capture scenarios literally only involve one group. Next round, they add some miscellaneous stones to the diagram while still marking the important stones to start acclimating the reader to seeing more complicated diagrams. Love it.</li>
<li>Though the book is designed for kids, both kids and adults alike will be able to learn everything they need to know about playing go in a fun and entertaining way.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What did I gain from reading this book?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Even though I already know all of these concepts, forcing myself to go through the book from start to finish was a great way for me to ensure that my reading abilities were 100% with even the most basic problems.</li>
<li>The school and workbook-like approach to teaching go has definitely helped me improve the way that I will be teaching go in the future.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What style of teaching does the book use?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Workbook Approach
<ul>
<li>They introduce concepts within one to two lines with diagrams to support them.</li>
<li>Once they introduce a concept, they provide multiple opportunities for practice.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Primary Teaching Mechanism:
<ul>
<li>Solving simple and easy problems.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Other Teaching Mechanisms:
<ul>
<li>Explanations with really easy multiple choice questions.</li>
<li>Kifus (i.e., game records) that are only around 10 moves long with short one line statements of the move&#8217;s purpose.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What aspect(s) can be improved on?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Sometimes the directions are misleading. For example, the direction is to atari the marked stones, but the problem&#8217;s solution is actually to capture. Two different objectives.</li>
<li>While most of the book is structured very well, sometimes the problems get ahead of themselves. For example, the directions are to atari the stones, but you need to actually be able to read out the ladder to know which way to atari.</li>
<li>For the next edition, I would recommend that jachung (i.e., reducing your own liberties) be introduced earlier since some problems prior to the explanation actually utilize it.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Is this book easy to read?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>It was very easy to progress through the book.</li>
<li>The English is not always the most grammatically correct, but the message is still pretty clear.</li>
</ul>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So I&#8217;m unbelievably busy with grad school work now, but that didn&#8217;t stop me from trying to play today. I have a ten page paper to finish by 7:00pm, and I played go&#8230; I know&#8230;. Anyhow, I lost my first game due to failing to defend a single point. Unfortunately, with all the stress, lack of sleep, and urgency of other things that I need to do, I went on tilt and could not regain composure. Against my better judgment, I went ahead and played another game after that. No good either. Two resignations. Ugh&#8230;<br />
The lesson of the day is simple. It&#8217;s just like Yuan Zhou told me, &#8220;When you play Go, you don&#8217;t want to have other distractions or other tasks eagerly waiting your attention.&#8221; And I definitely think that all this school stuff definitely impacted the quality of my games. sigh. It was two games&#8230; need to just move on.<br />
Make that three losses&#8230; this is just an awful streak. I&#8217;m being outfought in every battle&#8230; absolutely pathetic&#8230;</p>
