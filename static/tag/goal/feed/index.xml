				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;m happy to report that my ranked game today went very well. Each move was calculated and had an intended purpose. There were a few mistakes in my reading here and there, but overall it was a success when you consider some of my previous ranked games from a little while ago. So here&#8217;s to hoping that the <a title="The 6k Screwup" href="//the-6k-screwup/">tweak</a>Â I&#8217;ve made to the ranked games I play will allow me to begin to achieve my actual rank (whatever it is).<br />
As I continue to work towards achieving solid dan status, I have noticed that it is definitely becoming more difficult to improve. It&#8217;s not so much that it is &#8220;hard,&#8221; but the difficult lies in the fact that the proper steps to get stronger become hazy as you climb the ladder. It&#8217;s no longer as simple as improving your reading and having a better grasp of life and death. The more I have my games reviewed, the more I realize that I need to begin grasping and utilizing ideas like aji in order to reach the next level.<br />
Like anything else though, first thing first: <strong>Achieve solid 4k status before March</strong>.</p>
