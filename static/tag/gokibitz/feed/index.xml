				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hey everyone. Just wanted to let you know I&#8217;m still alive and well. Been getting into some really interesting projects these past few weeks and have been really pondering what I can do with blogging again since I miss doing it. And as someone who hates it when a regular blogger just drops out of the blogosphere, you can rest assured that I won&#8217;t ever just leave the blog hanging in the event I need to close up shop for awhile.<br />
In terms of what I&#8217;ve been up to, I&#8217;ve been tinkering again with daily regimens and playing games via <a title="Dragon Go Server" href="http://www.dragongoserver.net/">DGS</a> and <a title="Online Go Server" href="http://www.online-go.com/">OGS</a> while concurrently juggling a new job and trying to learn a ton of new skills. I&#8217;ve gone all the way back down to the very basics of doing only 10 life and death problems a day. They&#8217;re not hard in any sense of the word, but they help me to keep a connection to the world of go.<br />
And as a special treat for those who miss my reviews, I&#8217;ve decided to try reviewing one of my 9&#215;9 games that I played recently on GoQuest via an awesome new social kifu reviewing software called <a title="GoKibitz" href="http://www.gokibitz.com/">GoKibitz</a> that a close friend and long time rival built himself. So I hope you enjoy the review and I will try and post again soon!<br />
UPDATE: Apparently all my comments got lost in the abyss of the internet&#8230;. Oy vey&#8230; I&#8217;ll try and get another version up soon&#8230;.<br />
