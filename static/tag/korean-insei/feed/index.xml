				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Man. I really fell off the wagon this week in terms of my training regimen. I was super disciplined about my reading training a couple of weeks ago, but I really got bum rushed with other priorities in life and just couldn&#8217;t do the regimen properly. The only thing that is redeeming about this week is that I was able to practice problems here and there, but just not in one session the way I might have preferred.<br />
In addition, the silver lining of it all is that I&#8217;ve been much more involved with my game reviews and trying to really improve upon them. In case you missed it, this week there were two game reviews that were released (<a title="Monday Go Meditation: Game 50" href="//monday-go-meditation-game-50/">MGM 50</a> and <a title="WGW 36: Gu Li vs Lee Sedol — Jubango Game 3 Amateur Review" href="//wgw-36-gu-li-vs-lee-sedol-jubango-game-3-amateur-review/">Jubango Game 3</a>). And oy vey did they take a long time to do! Regardless, I would like to think that it will be valuable to my own growth and journey.<br />
Finally, I&#8217;ve started digging into the lectures on <a title="Yunguseng Dojang Official Site" href="http://www.yunguseng.com/">Yunguseng Dojang</a> and really have loved what I have been able to watch so far. I can only imagine what it will be like when I&#8217;m actually participating in the reviews and having my own games reviewed. So excited for the season to start!</p>
