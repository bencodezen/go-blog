				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For those who have never tried it before, playing an even game against a player that is reportedly two stones stronger than you can be a scary feeling. On one hand, you think &#8220;This can&#8217;t be too bad.&#8221; Yet, on the other hand, the board looks quite naked as you stare at the empty board while knowing that you should have two handicap stones sitting on the board. As someone who&#8217;s been through a couple experiences recently, it is quite the daunting feeling&#8230;</p>
<div style="text-align: left;"><span id="more-24"></span></div>
<p>Now, I understand that rank is, more often than not, a rather subjective one. A player can be stronger or weaker than his reported rank, and then of course there is the issue of whether your opponent&#8217;s playing style is weak to yours. Nonetheless, especially for players not yet in the high SDK and dan levels, the rank difference ends up impacting your mindset to some degree.<br />
The game was an intense one that left me with a racing heart and slight anxiety that I would misclick as my shaking hands attempted to place each stone. That being said, I am proud to say that today&#8217;s kifu has allowed me to obtain the &#8220;Beat a Stronger Player in an Even Game&#8221; accomplishment! In addition, being able to win against a stronger player in an even game has helped to reinforce my confidence against stronger opponents. Granted, I&#8217;m not saying I believe I can knocking down high SDK&#8217;s with ease; but I am now at least able to stand a bit straighter when faced with stronger opponents.<br />
Finally, today&#8217;s kifu has a special guest appearance from one of my favorite sensei&#8217;s: frozensoul! The kifu has a lot of great commentary and variations that I&#8217;m sure you could benefit from. The key lesson that I took away from his review is the usage of the double hane. If you are still feel a bit confused about that technique, be sure to look over the kifu for that explanation and more!</p>

This was a pretty scary game for me. I know I&#8217;ve been playing stronger opponents in the ASR League in even matches, but for some reason playing a ranked game against a 3k gave me the jitters. And I didn&#8217;t go looking for this game, this guy challenged me. Looking back on it, I&#8217;m pretty sure he was trying to play against weaker players so he could feel all big and mighty. Too bad he came out the loser&#8230;.<br />

<p>This is definitely a game that I&#8217;m certainly proud to call my own. In addition, I had never really experienced playing against a troll until this game. If you want a glimpse as to what I&#8217;m talking about, you can see it in the kifu (more profanity and name calling occurs afterwards, but you&#8217;ll get the gist of it based on what I left in the record).<br />
I think this is a game that any players below 10k might find useful. So please check it out and hopefully you&#8217;ll learn something new from my game!<br />
As a final note, for players who have never encountered trolls before and have no idea how to deal with them properly, here is some advice from my personal experience today</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">1. <strong>Do not stoop to their level</strong> &#8211; In other words, don&#8217;t curse. Don&#8217;t insult. Nada. Nothing. Zip. Otherwise you can forget about reporting them to an admin and gaining any sympathy.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">2. <strong>Report it to an admin</strong> &#8211; This is particularly recommended when your opponent has either escaped and/or is threatening to drag the game on till the end of time by using byoyomi forever&#8230;. And if you&#8217;re wondering how to find an admin on KGS, they have a star symbol next to their username.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">3. <strong>Vent about it with a friend, and then move on</strong> &#8211; Thankfully I had frozensoul there at the time, who saw the debacle go down when it happened, and he helped me through it and thus I&#8217;ve come out unscathed. But seriously, once you&#8217;ve vented, don&#8217;t let the troll impact your joy and happiness in playing go. Completely not worth it.</p>
<p>That being said, I hope you guys will enjoy the commentary and the new format. Till next time!<br />
<del>In case anyone is wondering, it seems that the new updated template for Blogger seems to override the code for embedding Eidogo into the blog posts, so that&#8217;s the reason I&#8217;ve had to resort to linking out onto Eidogo. Sorry for the inconvenience!</del></p>

<p><strong>Overall</strong><br />
The feeling of being in control of the board is a magnificent feeling. There wasn&#8217;t a single point in this game where I wasn&#8217;t making my moves recklessly. Each move was thought out, and had a purpose that even had some reading behind it. (I know&#8230; crazy right? After all, what crazy player reads out moves when he figures out where he wants to go&#8230;. absolute insanity&#8230;)<br />
<strong>My Opponent</strong><br />
I thought he was a great 9k, and probably in reality more of an 8k. He played a lot of unexpected moves that left me questioning how I should respond. Each move was very interesting and I most certainly look forward to playing him again.<br />
<strong>Mistakes</strong><br />
It feels like it&#8217;s been forever since I was last able to say that I don&#8217;t feel like I made any mistakes this game. The only two areas that were somewhat &#8220;unexpected&#8221; were:</p>
<ul>
<li>Move 50 (G14) &#8211; Although this ended up working out for me, I will definitely be the first to admit that this was more of an gut type move than a totally intentional one. My reading was shortsighted by the fact that the F12 group had aji that could be used against me.</li>
<li>Move 62 (K13) &#8211; In retrospect, I think this move would&#8217;ve been better used by extending at H10. It would&#8217;ve been a more proactive move while also protecting the cut at J13.</li>
<li>Move 65 (A17) &#8211; I had read out falsifying the last eye properly, but the atari definitely caught me off guard. I&#8217;m glad that it only cost me 6 points instead of the entire C17 group.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Prized Moments</strong><br />
There&#8217;s no feeling like setting up a scenario where regardless of which choice opponent makes, you&#8217;ll happily take the other&#8230;</p>
<ul>
<li>Move 36 (F12) &#8211; Can you see what I was preparing for?</li>
<li>Move 60 (F15) &#8211; The forcing move of C12 was unexpected and got my opponent the first true eye. Thankfully he ended in gote and I could play this move!</li>
<li>Move 70 (B9) &#8211; Although this may have seemed slow, this move ensured the life of my group so that I could attack or reduce as I pleased! A Lee Changho type move if I may so say myself!</li>
</ul>
