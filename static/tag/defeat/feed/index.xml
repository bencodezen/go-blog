				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>For this week&#8217;s go meditation, I am featuring my game from the Pumpkin Classic that I had the pleasure of visiting for a round. This game was an interesting challenge for me since it had been a while since I had played a game in person, let alone play a handicap game. As this is a handicap game where I play White, I hope that my thoughts throughout the game will help you understand better why players sometimes make the moves they do in handicap games. Enjoy!<br />

<h2>One Point Lesson</h2>
<p>When playing as White in a two stone handicap game, don’t try to complicate the game too early. If your opponent punishes your overplays early on, you will have a hard time coming back</p>

This past weekend I had the pleasure of attending the NOVA Pumpkin Classic Tournament and seeing many friends there. And though I originally planned on playing in the tournament that day, I ended up being on call for work and thus planned on only attending to see friends and show my support.<br />
Upon arrival though, I got convinced to play in the first round since we had even numbers. And while I would have liked to have played for more rounds, it was simply not possible for me to do so with a possible work call coming at any moment.<br />
On the upside, I did get to play a round against an opponent I had played against in the Baduk Open Championship. I had decided to self-promote to 1k this time and was giving her a 2 stone handicap. The following is the game record (which I will be sure to review in a future Monday Go Meditation).<br />

<p>Though I am a little sad I was not able to stay for the whole day, it was great being able to see everyone. An especially big shoutout goes to the Stafford Go community: Robbie, Anderson, and Ramon for being there and sharing a great lunch with me.<br />
Other than that, I’ve been adhering to my training schedule without fail thus far. And though I had some initial plans for ramping up content production here on the blog, it’ll have to wait a bit as I am in the process of sorting through things. No worries though, you can still expect to see the usual here. Just don’t expect any new weekly columns in the near future. Haha.<br />
With that said, for all those who celebrate Halloween, wishing you all a spectacular Halloween full of fun and candy!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 style="text-align: center;">Introduction</h2>
<p>For this week&#8217;s meditation, I am happy to feature fellow go blogger <a title="Kingdom of Baduk" href="http://kingdomofbaduk.blogspot.fr/">Pericles</a> to this series. The game below is a casual game that we played with one another and can in fact be seen as a teaching game of sorts. As Pericles is a 5-6 dan, you can predict the outcome pretty well; but I&#8217;m hoping that you&#8217;ll find the kifu entertaining as I try to flail around the board against his mighty strength. Enjoy!<br />

<p>For this week&#8217;s go meditation, I am happy to welcome my friend Bonscott back to being featured on MGM. Though our KGS ranks might say there&#8217;s a 3 stone difference, this game shows that the gap has closed a bit since last time we played. xD In terms of the game however, I think that this game goes to show how a lack of positional judgment and overestimation of your own territory can be the end of you. Hope you enjoy!<a href="//wp-content/uploads/2014/02/2014.02.24-MGM-44.sgf"><br />

<p style="text-align: center;">Failing to estimate the territory on the board at all is naive and will usually lead to misfortune.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 style="text-align: center;">Introduction</h2>
<p>For this week&#8217;s go meditation, we continue our walk down memory lane. I am a 13 kyu this week and played a game that was very surprising for me. To put it in another sense, I had a hard time believing that I had really played such a game as a 13k! In fact, this game puts some of my games as a SDK (i.e., single digit kyu) to shame. Haha. It makes me wonder what has happened to my go and whether there is something to be said about how I used to play versus how I play now. So much to think about… Anyhow, I hope that you will enjoy this game and find this game as surprising as I did! It seriously is an impressive game for two 13 kyus!<a href="//wp-content/uploads/2013/10/2013.10.28-MGM-33.sgf"><br />

<p style="text-align: center;">When trying to kill a group, be careful not to let your groups get cut up. Otherwise you might find yourself in a dire capturing race that you cannot win.</p>

<p>For this week&#8217;s go meditation, we continue our journey down memory lane! Last week I was a mere 15 kyu, but this week we jump ahead to when I gained my first stone! Kageyama says that one of the greatest enjoyments of go is gaining a stone in strength (which obviously becomes far less frequent as one gets stronger); but I do remember the excitement of seeing my rank tick up a number. Haha. Anyways, I hope that you&#8217;ll find humor and enjoyment as you watch my past self flail around the board. =D See you next week! <a href="//wp-content/uploads/2013/10/2013.10.28-MGM-33.sgf"><br />

<p style="text-align: center;">While it feels good to fight and gain a chunk of center territory, the territory you typically give away on the sides and corners will exceed your center gain.</p>

<p>For this month&#8217;s go meditations, our theme is Novice November! For many of you, I&#8217;m sure you found this blog when I was already a solid single digit kyu and working my way up the ladder. However, this was most certainly not always the case. xD So to remind some of you who only see where I am now, I thought it would be fun if we did a throwback of games back when I was a fledgling double digit kyu. With that said, let&#8217;s turn back time to when I had just started go and played my first KGS game against a human opponent as a 15 kyu. Enjoy!<a href="//wp-content/uploads/2013/11/2013.11.07-MGM-34.sgf"><br />

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: left;">For this week&#8217;s bonus review, we will be going over my third game from the Canada Go League where I suffer a one-sided defeat. There is no excuse for the mistakes I made (both strategically and tactically), but the only thing I will say in my defense is that I tried out a lot of new experiments this game. And the thing to realize about experiments is that they often blow up in your face. This is a great example of one of them.

<p>For today&#8217;s go meditation, I will be reviewing a game I played recently with fellow go tweeter goBum! Though we have known each other for quite a while now, I&#8217;m surprised it&#8217;s taken us so long to finally play a game with one another. =D Nonetheless, I&#8217;m glad we were finally able to do so and you can see the game below along with some insight that I received from a dan player who gave us a review afterwards. There are quite a few moments where I made abysmal moves that are shameful and vulgar, but it was a fun game and I definitely learned quite a bit from it. Many thanks to goBum for letting me use the kifu and I hope I can give you a better game next time!<a href="//wp-content/uploads/2013/08/2013.08.05-MGM-21.sgf"><br />

<p>For today&#8217;s go meditation, I am happy to feature fellow go player and friend moboy78! We&#8217;ve talked about playing a longer game with one another for quite some time, and I&#8217;m glad we finally did! He was technically supposed to give me a 4 stone handicap at the time (since my rank had dropped to 6k). Hehe. xD However, though I don&#8217;t ever like tooting my own horn, even I had to admit that my rank on KGS is pretty bogus for the most part. So we agreed to play an even game and played a really fun game that you will find below. Hope you enjoy!<a href="//wp-content/uploads/2013/08/2013.08.05-MGM-21.sgf"><br />
