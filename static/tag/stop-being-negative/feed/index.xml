Last week, I was playing a game when other players started showing up to watch the game. My opponent then remarked, &#8220;Everyone is here to see me lose.&#8221; And then I promptly replied, &#8220;You&#8217;ve got it wrong. They&#8217;re here to see me lose.&#8221; Though it was said in a joking manner that was also supposed to be humble, it wasn&#8217;t until after the game that a comment made by a visitng dan player struck me: &#8220;Confidence is worth two stones.&#8221;<br />
It got me thinking about my whole approach to the game, or perhaps life in general. With the way I&#8217;ve been brought up, it&#8217;s expected that one be humble and not be cocky or overconfident. However, I started to wonder whether or not I ended up taking this mentality too far and becoming self-deprecating instead. In other words, even though I would say things like, &#8220;No no, I&#8217;m a weak player&#8221; as a way of being humble; I may have actually been planting seeds of doubt in myself this entire time.<br />
Now to be clear, I&#8217;m not saying that one should prance around saying how they&#8217;ll win every game and rub it in their opponent&#8217;s faces. &#8220;Look at me! I&#8217;m so great!&#8221; I mean sure, sometimes the cockiness works as a placebo effect and some people end up becoming &#8220;stronger,&#8221; but then everyone thinks you&#8217;re an asshole and that is way worse than being a weak player. So instead, I will stop using negative statements and stop worrying about what other people think.<br />
With each stone I play, I will simply aim to play the best go that I can. That is all that matters.</p>
