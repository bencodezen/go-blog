<p>So I currently have the pleasure and exciting opportunity to be participating in an all week training for Adobe CQ5.5, but that means that there is very little time for playing go. =(<br />
In order to satiate my go craving for the day, I&#8217;ve actually started watching dan level games and trying to predict where I would go and understanding why they play the way they do. Granted, I know that I do not have the reading ability that they possess and thus will not be able to understand things entirely; but I think that it has been a fun exercise for me to improve my ability to analyze the whole board position when I have more time to play.<br />
Meanwhile, a big shout out to my friend Scotist who had a fantastic winning streak yesterday! Great job man!</p>
