				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Man&#8230;. I&#8217;m used to being destroyed by my opponents&#8230; but this guy had an annoying mouth and I was destroyed by him.  The way he took advantage of almost every single weakness was quite beyond me.  I think I was doing okay in the opening, but then I didn&#8217;t properly chase down what should&#8217;ve been a dead group.  Ugh. Can&#8217;t even comment on the game.  But for all those players looking to see bad aji come back and kick you in the balls, and the usage of a double ko to kill of groups that were supposed to be alive: this is the game.<br />
