Last week, I had the pleasure of attending the 54th <a title="Sakura Matsuri Official Site" href="http://www.sakuramatsuri.org/">Sakura Matsuri Street Festival</a> in Washington D.C.! For those who don&#8217;t know, this is in conjunction with the annual <a title="Cherry Blossom Festival Official Site" href="http://www.nationalcherryblossomfestival.org/">Cherry Blossom Festival</a> that is held in D.C. every year and runs from 10:30AM to 6:30PM. And for a nominal fee of $10, you get entry into a street full of vendors, performances, cultural booths, and most importantly, the go booth!<br />
<span id="more-5096"></span><br />
<figure id="attachment_5098" style="width: 346px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014SakuraMatsuri-02.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-5098" alt="2014SakuraMatsuri-02" src="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014SakuraMatsuri-02.jpg?resize=346%2C461" width="346" height="461" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Though a bit blurry, you can get a sense of how crowded it was. Not for the claustrophobic!</figcaption></figure>
Making your way through the crowd was a bit of a challenge since people would randomly stop to look at things or be waiting in these long lines for food. So as you can expect, there were all sorts of random jams in the street. However, once you make your way past the main intersection, it didn&#8217;t take long before you found yourself before the go booth.<br />
<figure id="attachment_5099" style="width: 448px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014SakuraMatsuri-03.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-5099" alt="2014SakuraMatsuri-03" src="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014SakuraMatsuri-03.jpg?resize=448%2C448" width="448" height="448" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Here&#8217;s a shot of our booth from the main side.</figcaption></figure>
<figure id="attachment_5100" style="width: 448px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014SakuraMatsuri-04.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-5100" alt="2014SakuraMatsuri-04" src="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014SakuraMatsuri-04.jpg?resize=448%2C448" width="448" height="448" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Here&#8217;s a shot of the booth from the left side peering into the booth.</figcaption></figure>
I arrived a couple hours late, but as you can see in the shots above, things were quite busy! Even though we had around 8-10 teachers, you can see that everyone is busy teaching. Definitely something I was ecstatic to see as a go enthusiast.<br />
<figure id="attachment_5101" style="width: 448px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014SakuraMatsuri-05.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-5101" alt="2014SakuraMatsuri-05" src="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014SakuraMatsuri-05.jpg?resize=448%2C448" width="448" height="448" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Pictured: Myself (center), John (with the hat) and Justin Teng (red jacket)</figcaption></figure>
The shot above is of me after I got settled and teaching my first customer of the day. As you can see on the board, we&#8217;re playing a game of first capture!<br />
<figure id="attachment_5102" style="width: 384px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014SakuraMatsuri-06.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-5102" alt="2014SakuraMatsuri-06" src="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014SakuraMatsuri-06.jpg?resize=384%2C512" width="384" height="512" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">The brochure that we were handing out.</figcaption></figure>
Though we had quite a few brochures printed out (I think more than 200) and had a few pamphlets, I was quite surprised that we had so many people asking for more information that we were running out before 3:00PM had even came around. Definitely a lesson learned for next year!<br />
<figure id="attachment_5103" style="width: 448px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014SakuraMatsuri-07.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-5103" alt="2014SakuraMatsuri-07" src="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014SakuraMatsuri-07-1024x976.jpg?resize=448%2C427" width="448" height="427" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Another shot of us busy at work teaching the never ending crowd of people looking to sit down and have a shot to learn themselves!</figcaption></figure>
After I sat down to start teaching, I have to say that everything was moving at such a fast pace. First, all the students I taught learned at a quick pace and grasped the game pretty quickly. Secondly, there were no shortage of spectators who were paying close attention to what was being taught so they could learn about it themselves. And to my surprise and delight, every time a seat opened up, there was always someone ready to sit down and try their hand at it.<br />
<figure id="attachment_5104" style="width: 384px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014SakuraMatsuri-08.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-5104" alt="2014SakuraMatsuri-08" src="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014SakuraMatsuri-08.jpg?resize=384%2C512" width="384" height="512" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Here&#8217;s a shot of me trying to switch between four different simultaneous teaching games. For  the tech nerds, one of my customers had Google Glasses on! How awesome is that?!</figcaption></figure>
Eventually, things got so busy that I was simultaneously teaching around 2-3 people at a time on average. To streamline the process a bit, I figured out that having everyone to focus on one board while I explained the rules worked out really well. And then when they had an idea what was going on, I would give them their own boards and stones and play simul games with all of them so that they were all equally engaged.<br />
<figure id="attachment_5105" style="width: 384px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014SakuraMatsuri-09.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-5105" alt="2014SakuraMatsuri-09" src="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014SakuraMatsuri-09.jpg?resize=384%2C512" width="384" height="512" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Here&#8217;s a shot of me in my 4 way simul teaching game. But as you notice in the background, the streets are seriously packed and all the teachers are busy teaching.</figcaption></figure>
All in all, the event was a huge success and I felt that a lot of people were able to be exposed to go and learn about it. The only real lesson learned from this event, however, is that we definitely needed a  surplus of marketing material. It would have definitely been nice if we could have handed out more brochures more aggressively without worrying about our inventory.<br />
Finally, the thing that was really great to see what that a majority of the people I taught asked me for more information (for which I promptly gave them my blog and email) and if we even had any go sets to purchase (which we unfortunately did not have and is something I want to look into next year).<br />
So for all those who have any Japanese cultural events in your local area, I definitely encourage you all to try and setup a booth like we did. Because at the end of the day, if there was only one thing I learned from this event, it is that go has a real potential to appeal to all types of people and can eventually become a household staple like chess or checkers if we keep spreading the word with outreach initiatives like this one.<br />
<span style="text-align: center; line-height: 1.5em;">Many thanks to John Goon for coordinating and setting up this event. Definitely looking forward to it next year! </span></p>

<h2 style="text-align: left;">Review</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Yunnan Arts is a local (Virginia) business, owned by Mike and Wen, who sells Go equipment to the public. I had the pleasure of meeting with them last week and experiencing their products while playing some awesome Go with Mike.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">To start, here&#8217;s a brief overlay of the equipment I got to see and experience personally. (Note: The Go Congress has recently passed so a lot of their wares have already been sold and the new shipment had not come in yet).</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><a href="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2010/09/yunnan02.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-4757" alt="yunnan02" src="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2010/09/yunnan02-300x225.jpg?resize=300%2C225" width="300" height="225" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><a href="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2010/09/yunnan03.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-4758" alt="yunnan03" src="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2010/09/yunnan03-225x300.jpg?resize=225%2C300" width="225" height="300" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Here are some of my favorites:</p>
<figure id="attachment_4759" style="width: 300px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2010/09/yunnan04.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-4759" alt="yunnan04" src="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2010/09/yunnan04-300x225.jpg?resize=300%2C225" width="300" height="225" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Dragon Bowl Design</figcaption></figure>
<figure style="width: 300px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2010/09/yunnan05.jpg"><img alt="yunnan05" src="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2010/09/yunnan05-300x225.jpg?resize=300%2C225" width="300" height="225" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Pink Flower Design &#8211; Cloisonne Enamel Bowl (Side View)</figcaption></figure>
<figure style="width: 300px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2010/09/yunnan06.jpg"><img alt="yunnan06" src="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2010/09/yunnan06-300x225.jpg?resize=300%2C225" width="300" height="225" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Pink Flower Design &#8211; Cloisonne Enamel Bowl (Aerial View)</figcaption></figure>
<figure style="width: 300px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2010/09/yunnan07.jpg"><img alt="yunnan07" src="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2010/09/yunnan07-300x225.jpg?resize=300%2C225" width="300" height="225" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Green Floral Design &#8211; Cloisonne Enamel Bowl</figcaption></figure>
<figure style="width: 300px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2010/09/yunnan08.jpg"><img alt="yunnan08" src="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2010/09/yunnan08-300x225.jpg?resize=300%2C225" width="300" height="225" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Marble Go Bowl</figcaption></figure>
<p style="text-align: left;">The following is a table/bowl set that are sold separately. I know it&#8217;s not clear in the photograph, but the red stripes on the table and board here are actually tiny stripes of red, black, red, black, etc. It looks super cool&#8230;. I only wish my camera could have taken a clear shot of that&#8230; but I had no luck with that.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><a href="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2010/09/yunnan09.jpg"><img class="aligncenter" alt="yunnan09" src="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2010/09/yunnan09-300x225.jpg?resize=300%2C225" width="300" height="225" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><a href="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2010/09/yunnan10.jpg"><img class="aligncenter" alt="yunnan10" src="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2010/09/yunnan10-300x225.jpg?resize=300%2C225" width="300" height="225" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><a href="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2010/09/yunnan11.jpg"><img class="aligncenter" alt="yunnan11" src="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2010/09/yunnan11-300x225.jpg?resize=300%2C225" width="300" height="225" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The following is a photograph Mike and I decided to take for fun. They are the four sets of stones we had the leisure of playing with:</p>
<figure style="width: 300px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2010/09/yunnan12.jpg"><img alt="yunnan12" src="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2010/09/yunnan12-300x225.jpg?resize=300%2C225" width="300" height="225" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">From left to right: Yunzi, Slate &amp; Shell, Jade Set [Green], Jade Set [White]</figcaption></figure>
<p style="text-align: left;">As a quick comparison of all the stones, they all handle well as is expected. The jade sets were very interesting to play with since they have a different feel, but definitely one I will eventually add to my collection. Slate and shell is by far my favorite (to be more accurate, shell is my favorite). Is that a surprise? Absolutely not. I will have to say though, that slate is not the best black material. I know it&#8217;s tradition and it&#8217;s been paired together, but Wen put it perfectly when she said that the set was like a beautiful women marrying an ugly man. There just is a staggering difference between the two. Haha.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;">Conclusion</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">I had a magnificent time being able to get to know Mike and Wen and experience their products. Their products come directly from manufacturers in China so you know you are getting genuine equipment.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Even though I have not had the pleasure of ordering online from them yet, their products are top notch and I can&#8217;t wait to add their Go equipment into my collection!</p>
