				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 style="text-align: left;">Overview</h2>
<p>As I&#8217;m sure you all have noticed, I have finally gotten around to releasing my <a title="Hong Kong Trip: Part 1 — The Scenery" href="//hong-kong-trip-part-1/">Hong Kong trip series</a> this week! It took quite a few hours to work through all the photos and then make sure they were ready for viewing, but if you all enjoyed the posts, then I think it was plenty worthwhile.<br />
With that said, I have been starting to approach my life with a lot more vigor. One of the things I&#8217;ve gotten back to doing consistently is going to my local boxing gym. Even though this takes up a lot of time throughout the week, I think that we often underestimate the connection between physical and mental conditioning. Both must be optimal in order for them to work together harmoniously. In addition, I&#8217;ve started watching more <a title="Yunguseng Dojang Official Website" href="http://www.yunguseng.com/">Yunguseng Dojang</a> lectures and changed up my training a bit.<br />
Over the past week, I got a chance reconnect with Lynx on KGS and we had a fun teaching game. I lost of course, but after a bit of discussion, she showed me an article she wrote on &#8220;<a title="Lynx's Article on How to Improve at Go" href="http://shobia.com/w/How_to_Improve_at_Go">How to Improve at Go</a>.&#8221; While I could write a whole post about the various things I like about the article (which will probably happen in the near future when I have a moment to breathe), the main thing that stuck out to me was her emphasis on tesuji problems rather than life and death problems. As a result, you&#8217;ll notice my training regimen has changed a bit from before.<br />
I&#8217;m still trying to create a training schedule that works well for me, so you&#8217;ll have to bear with me as I continue to experiment and try different things. It&#8217;s particularly volatile at the moment, but a large part is due to the fact that I really want to be in a stable position when the <a title="Yunguseng Dojang Official Website" href="http://www.yunguseng.com/">Yunguseng Dojang</a> starts in May. So I&#8217;m really testing the waters in various areas to see what works best for me. Just have to keep trying.</p>
