				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>In today&#8217;s go meditation, I am glad to welcome back fellow friend and go player Bonscott. For those who don&#8217;t remember, I&#8217;ve played a number of even games against Bonscott (even though there is a few stones difference between our ranks) and actually lost quite a few of them before. So when he challenged me to a game recently, I made sure to not underestimate him!<br />
In terms of the game, you&#8217;ll get to see the rather uncommon 3-3 opening. In addition, this is a good game for study in regards to the importance of selecting the correct strategy in conjunction with your opening moves. As you progress through the game, you will notice that Black&#8217;s attempt to shift from territorial to moyo and how it results in a difficult uphill battle for Black.<br />
Finally, in light of Halloween last Friday, Iâ€™ve included a fun life and death problem with a pretty detailed variations at the end of the game. Hope that you enjoy this game!<br />

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 style="text-align: center;">Introduction</h2>
<p>For today&#8217;s go meditation, I thought we would go ahead and take a break from even games and feature a handicap game! This game features my friend Bonscott and a very difficult game for White. In fact, if not for a few crucial moments, Black had played remarkably well and was not allowing White any easy opportunity to catch up. Though the game is decided by a cut that both of us initially miss, it was a tough game for White and Black should be very proud of the game below. Hope you enjoy!<a href="//wp-content/uploads/2013/08/2013.08.05-MGM-21.sgf"><br />

<h2 style="text-align: center;"><strong>One Point Lesson</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: center;">When playing as White in handicap games, you must be extremely vigilant in the endgame.</p>
