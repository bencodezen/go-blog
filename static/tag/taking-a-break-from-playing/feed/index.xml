				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It&#8217;s been five days since I last played a game of go, but it has felt like an eternity. Haha. I found myself logging onto KGS multiple times a day to look at game records of my friends or watch other games just to prevent myself from getting entangled in a game. It doesn&#8217;t quite measure up to playing, but it helped to satisfy the urge to just play. I&#8217;m looking forward to my game with Nate tomorrow, but I&#8217;ll probably be avoiding ranked games for a little.<br />
<span id="more-6"></span><br />
In terms of what I&#8217;ve been up to, I&#8217;m actually working pretty hard on getting this blog&#8217;s redesign ready for launch. I&#8217;m aiming for launching in the beginning of November, but we&#8217;ll see how it goes. I&#8217;m aiming to bring a big change to the blog that will improve the blog&#8217;s experience and quality of information.<br />
In addition, while working on the redesign has its own fun and adventure, I&#8217;ve been trying to expand my understanding of go theory. I had been trying to work on my reading abilities through The Elementary Go Series: <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Tesuji</span> and <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Life and Death</span>, but I was getting bored and unable to focus. So instead of trying to mindlessly finish the books, I moved on to more theoretical based books such as <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Attack and Defense</span> and <span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Power of the Star Point</span>Â for now. (Don&#8217;t get me wrong though. I&#8217;m still working on tsumego, just nothing mind bending at the moment.)<br />
If anyone has any ideas or suggestions for the blog redesign, please be sure to let me know! All comments and feedback would be greatly appreciated!</p>
