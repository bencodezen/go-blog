				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>It seems I&#8217;m on a trend of not playing as many games anymore, but I&#8217;m okay with that for now since I&#8217;m currently in a big study mode. I have over 100+ books in my collection (and that&#8217;s physical books mind you) and I have barely made a dent. In addition, I have another plan to immerse myself in studying Korean style go books. It will involve buying lots of new books and changing my regimen, but before I do that I want to finish all the Kiseido series that I have started. So, be on the lookout for lots more book reviews!</p>
<h2>Games</h2>
<ul>
<li><span style="line-height: 13px;">KGS &#8211; 3 games (2 wins : 1 loss)</span></li>
<li>DGS &#8211; 2 ongoing games</li>
<li>Nova &#8211; 2 ongoing games</li>
</ul>
<h2>Training</h2>
<ul>
<li><span style="line-height: 13px;">Worked on <em>Essential Life &amp; Death,</em><em> Vol. 2 </em>everyday.</span></li>
<li>Worked a little bit on <em>Attacking and Defending Moyos</em>.</li>
<li>Worked through <em>Modern Master Games, Vol. 1</em>.</li>
<li>Finished <em>Positional Judgment</em>.</li>
<li>Started and finished <em>The Direction of Play</em>.</li>
<li>Started <i>Elementary Go Series &#8211; Tesuji.</i></li>
</ul>
<h2>Lessons Learned</h2>
<ol>
<li>I am not vigilant when it comes to reading out sequences properly.</li>
<li>I still play &#8220;wishful go&#8221; and think that my opponents will respond to things that I myself would never respond to.</li>
<li>To help remedy my problem of playing moves without thinking, I&#8217;m trying to take one deep breath before each move to try and slow down.</li>
</ol>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>This week seems to have been dwindling down in terms of playing. Part of it is due to the fact that I know that I&#8217;ve been in more aggressive mood lately (which usually leads to me going on tilt), but I think the other part is that I am getting in a study groove again. I&#8217;ve gotten an urge to try and read as many books as I can possibly can before needing to burning out from studying, by which of course then it&#8217;ll be time to play more games again. On top of that, I&#8217;m also trying to really create a robust <a title="Books" href="//reviews/books/">Book Review</a> section for this blog so that players can really get a sense of what they&#8217;re buying when selecting a book.</p>
<h2>Games</h2>
<ul>
<li><span style="line-height: 13px;">KGS &#8211; 1 game (0 wins : 1 loss)</span></li>
<li>DGS &#8211; 1 ongoing game</li>
<li>Nova &#8211; 1 ongoing game</li>
</ul>
<h2>Training</h2>
<ul>
<li><span style="line-height: 13px;">Started the <em>Essential Life &amp; Death</em> series again.</span></li>
<li>Finished the theory section and some problems in <em>Mastering the Basics: Ko.</em></li>
<li>Finished my first reading of <em>Kage&#8217;s Secret Chronicles of Handicap Go.</em></li>
<li>Started reading <em>The Chinese Opening</em> by Yuan Zhou.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Lessons Learned</h2>
<ol>
<li>If I can&#8217;t give 100% of my attention to a game of go, I should refrain from playing with strangers.</li>
<li>I need to re-discipline my reading abilities so that I feel certain about what might happen instead of playing a move because it &#8220;looks like it&#8217;ll work.&#8221;</li>
</ol>
