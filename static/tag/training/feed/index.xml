[expand title=&#8221;Before I Read This Book&#8230;&#8221; trigclass=&#8221;expandTitle&#8221;]
As a mid to high SDK (i.e., single digit kyu) player, I was expecting to see the same quality of content from previous volumes. In addition, I was hoping that I would be able to solve most problems with relative ease while finding some problems challenging.<br />
[/expand]
[expand title=&#8221;My Review&#8221; trigclass=&#8221;expandTitle&#8221; expanded=&#8221;true&#8221;]
Once again, Lee Jae-Hwan has managed to sweep me off my feet when it comes to providing incredible content that really got my brain working. There were countless sections in here that I always knew about but really appreciated getting a chance to truly practice. Examples include: Identifying Seki, The Loose Connection, The Stone Pagoda, Hane Twice to Gain a Liberty, etc.<br />
Overall, I felt that the problems definitely started to increase in difficulty. While some problems are still very easy to solve and have very obvious solutions, there were numerous times where I had to really start looking at variations before concluding what my answer was going to be. I really appreciated this gradual increase in difficulty.<br />
Finally, some of you will notice that my &#8220;Things to Improve&#8221; section has become more of an Errata section (i.e., errors that I found). Although I still love the book and the series as a whole, there were a few more errors than I would have liked to have seen and some sections that weren&#8217;t as clear as they could have been (i.e., Cut On the Opposite Side).<br />
Nonetheless, this is still a wonderful addition to the series, and I&#8217;m looking forward to the next one!<br />
[/expand]
[expand title=&#8221;Synopsis&#8221; trigclass=&#8221;expandTitle&#8221;]
<strong>What did I enjoy about the book?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A very nice emphasis on evaluating seki positions.</li>
<li>Has the reader practice &#8220;fake nets.&#8221;</li>
<li>Does not hesitate to bring back basics like reading the ladder.</li>
<li>Really trains a lot of skills players often overlook like identifying vital points, hane twice to gain a liberty, and loose ladders.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What did I gain from reading this book?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>More comfortable with my ability to recognize seki positions.</li>
<li>Increased familiarity with various nets and reading out whether they work or not.</li>
<li>Increased confidence in reading out variations of basic life and death sequences.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What is the format of the book?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The book is primarily structured as follows:
<ul>
<li>(1) A one page explanation of the topic that you are about to practice. Example: When behind in liberties. They not only show the sequence for the proper technique, but also include common mistakes and brief explanations as to why they are mistakes.</li>
<li>(2) A set of very easy to understand and follow practice problems to ensure you understand what you are learning.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What aspect can be improved on?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Page 65 (#11) &#8211; Not a great example of bamboo vital point.</li>
<li>Page 66 (#5) &#8211; Answer is not the actual weakpoint. The 4-1 point is the weak point.</li>
<li>Page 69 (#4) &#8211; No solution available. Answer is the 4-1 point.</li>
<li>Page 94 Solutions &#8211; Label misprint. Skipped #10.</li>
<li>Page 122 (#12), Page 123 (#18), and Page 128 (#18) are identical problems.</li>
<li>Page 127 (#12) &#8211; In the wrong section. Different problem than expected. A save black problem in a kill white section.</li>
<li>Page 128 (#18) &#8211; In the wrong section. A kill white problem in a Save black section.</li>
<li>Page 143 (#22) &#8211; Again. Seems out of place. Problem&#8217;s solution is to maximize Black&#8217;s profit and not reduce White&#8217;s.</li>
<li>Page 148 (#3 Solution) &#8211; Wrong diagram. The answer should be the solid connection at 4-2 point. The tiger&#8217;s mouth at 4-1 works as well but leaves a ko threat of an atari at 3-2 and is therefore inferior to the solid connection.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Is this book easy to read?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Yes. Other than a few odd grammatical structures, it doesn&#8217;t get much more simple or straightforward than this.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Bottom Line</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Continues to live up to the quality of content you come to expect from this series.</li>
<li>Completely worth your time and money!</li>
</ol>
[/expand]
[expand title=&#8221;Recommended For&#8230;&#8221; trigclass=&#8221;expandTitle&#8221;]
<ul>
<li>Though the series is designed for kids, both kids and adults alike will be able to learn everything they need to know about playing go in a fun and entertaining way.</li>
<li>People who enjoy learning things in an easy to understand format and lots of opportunities to reinforce what they are learning.</li>

[expand title=&#8221;Before I Read This Book&#8230;&#8221; trigclass=&#8221;expandTitle&#8221;]
As a mid to high SDK (i.e., single digit kyu) player, I was expecting to see the same quality of content from previous volumes. In addition, I was hoping that I would be able to solve most problems with relative ease while finding some problems challenging.<br />
[/expand]
[expand title=&#8221;My Review&#8221; trigclass=&#8221;expandTitle&#8221; expanded=&#8221;true&#8221;]
This volume starts with a skill that I believe many players are lazy about: counting liberties. And to be honest, I did not realize how much I would have to struggle through this section. It wasn&#8217;t until I started working through these problems that I realized how lazy I&#8217;ve been and how weak I am at this fundamental skill. Though a bit of a shock, it was a good reminder of how weak my basics are.<br />
In this volume, a new problem type is introduced: profiting from your opponent&#8217;s overplays. This was by far one of the most surprising and enjoyable sections in the book since very little practice is ever given to players for this. Stronger players constantly tell weaker players to learn how to punish overplays, but there has been little material to focus on how to do so. Up till this book, I always found that learning to punish overplays came from experience and nothing else. Well, this section is that something else.<br />
Another thing that I noticed in this book is the categorization of life and death problems based on techniques. Most of the life and death books I have encountered thus far generally just include an assortment of problems, but I think that the categorization of problems based on technique is one of the more effective ways to teach players from the ground up. I definitely am hoping to see more of this in the future.<br />
And as if I wasn&#8217;t already impressed enough with this volume, they also take great care to teach the foundation behind the usage of certain moves or techniques. For example, many of us are familiar with what snapback is, but we don&#8217;t really get much training in regards to making the snapback. Another example would be practicing the double hane. Most players learn that it&#8217;s a useful move, but players are often forced to guess and learn the hard way in the middle of their game. And that can be painfully slow if you are only playing occassionally and do not have guidance at all.<br />
Finally, though it feels a little late in the series to finally see this, I&#8217;m really glad that they have a section devoted to training basic sente and gote understanding. Players can practice what I consider the most fundamental endgame problem: Find the sente endgame move. You might scoff at how simple that sounds, but I cannot count how many times I&#8217;ve seen kyu players just blatantly ignore sente plays for gote ones.<br />
Bottom line: Though I didn&#8217;t think they could improve the series much more, this volume just goes to show how well Lee Jae-Hwan understands breaking down the fundamentals of go into understable bite size pieces. Highly recommended!<br />
[/expand]
[expand title=&#8221;Synopsis&#8221; trigclass=&#8221;expandTitle&#8221;]
<strong>What did I enjoy about the book?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Forces players to understand counting liberties in capturing races.</li>
<li>Focuses on how to punish overplays that players commonly make.</li>
<li>Trains players on how to properly utilize moves like double hane.</li>
<li>Introduces sente and gote in an easy to understand manner.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What did I gain from reading this book?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Realization of how weak my liberty counting abilities are. They are stronger now, but I know that I still have a bit to go before I am confident in them.</li>
<li>Better understanding of how to use the double hane.</li>
<li>Sharpened intuition for utilizing tesuji like snapback and shortage of liberties.</li>
<li>Reinforced understanding of the foundation of endgame plays.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What is the format of the book?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The book is primarily structured as follows:
<ul>
<li>(1) A one page explanation of the topic that you are about to practice. Example: When behind in liberties. They not only show the sequence for the proper technique, but also include common mistakes and brief explanations as to why they are mistakes.</li>
<li>(2) A set of very easy to understand and follow practice problems to ensure you understand what you are learning.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What aspect can be improved on?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Page 145 &#8211; Directions should read: Black to play a sente move.</li>
<li>Page 162: Problem #20 &#8211; The solution in the answer book is technically correct in that it&#8217;s the best endgame sequence. However, it fails to what the problem is asking for (i.e., A, B, or C) since it chooses D (which does not exist in the book). For those who are looking for the simple answer, it is A.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Is this book easy to read?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Yes. It doesn&#8217;t get much more simple or straightforward than this.</li>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A couple days ago, I suffered a rather one handed defeat that was a rather rude awakening. Not only did I lose convincingly, but I made three very critical misreads during the game that sealed the deal. Needless to say, it was rather dishearteningly en you consider how much time I&#8217;ve put into my studying.<br />
Of course, with a shock like that, it is only natural that I took some time to really evaluate how I have been studying. Though my reading productivity has been rather impressive to some, it is no surprise that I have ended up sacrificed accuracy in end. My reading speed is rather quick, but the lack of discipline when it comes to reading alternate variations or considering the fact that my opponent might just flat out ignore me is not taken into consideration when I&#8217;m actually playing. As a result, I have thought about different ways to approach my training.<br />
So far, what I have decided that I need to switch from a task based productivity to a time based productivity. What does that mean exactly? Well, instead of trying to complete say 300 problems a day, I will instead devote a full 20 minutes to practicing problems. How ever many I finish is completely irrelevant, but I will hopefully be able to focus more on the accuracy and discipline of my reading this way. In addition, this will hopefully help me manage my time better and prevent me from throwing my life out of balance.</p>

[expand title=&#8221;Before I Read This Book&#8230;&#8221; trigclass=&#8221;expandTitle&#8221;]
Around this time, my reading skills and knowledge was around 4-5 kyu. I have had a lot of success with this series up to this point, so I was looking forward to what skills I would be training next.<br />
[/expand]
[expand title=&#8221;My Review&#8221; trigclass=&#8221;expandTitle&#8221; expanded=&#8221;true&#8221;]
In this volume of the Jump Level Up Series, you will find the usual sample openings and introduction of a couple joseki along with a heavy emphasis on training techniques in capture stones. Whether this is through eye space reduction, shortage of liberties, or ways to get ahead in capturing races, there is certainly a lot to be learned and trained in this book. Other sections that may be of interest to others include finding effective connections along with an introduction of some endgame techniques as well. There is a section on ko in here as well, but it is not very robust and one should not expect too much from it. Overall however, the book has continued to live up to my expectations for this series and I would highly recommend it!<br />
[/expand]
[expand title=&#8221;Synopsis&#8221; trigclass=&#8221;expandTitle&#8221;]
<strong>What did I enjoy about the book?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Lots of training on capturing techniques.</li>
<li>It forces you to really get comfortable with capturing races.</li>
<li>Continues to provide the format and quality of content you come to expect from the series.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What did I gain from reading this book?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Improved ability to identify ways to get ahead in capturing races.</li>
<li>Some new endgame techniques that I have started to look for in my actual games.</li>
<li>Improved overall reading ability.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What is the format of the book?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The book is primarily structured as follows: (1) A one page explanation of the topic that you are about to practice. Example: When behind in liberties. They not only show the sequence for the proper technique, but also include common mistakes and brief explanations as to why they are mistakes. (2) A set of very easy to understand and follow practice problems to ensure you understand what you are learning.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What aspect can be improved on?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>On two occasions, a problem that is beyond the scope of what I was practicing popped up. Problems #23 and #24 on Page 151. This was rather left-field and threw me off quite a bit. I would recommend against these sort of problems since it can be discouraging to those without an answer book.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Is this book easy to read?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Yes. It doesn&#8217;t get much more simple or straightforward than this.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Bottom Line</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Continues to live to the high expectations I have for this series.</li>
<li>An incredible way for players to immerse themselves and gain the ability to actually apply the concepts they are learning to their own games.</li>
<li>Worth the money!</li>
</ol>
[/expand]
[expand title=&#8221;Recommended For&#8230;&#8221; trigclass=&#8221;expandTitle&#8221;]
<ul>
<li>Though the series is designed for kids, both kids and adults alike will be able to learn everything they need to know about playing go in a fun and entertaining way.</li>
<li>People who enjoy learning things in an easy to understand format and lots of opportunities to reinforce what they are learning.</li>

Something interesting happened yesterday. I had just finished the arc in <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;ved=0CC8QFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FFighting_Spirit_(manga)&amp;ei=6IoOUrG_FaWbygGL6oCwAg&amp;usg=AFQjCNFFI0eP4wTVR8AszqReTx_t5ZpG1w&amp;sig2=vGXcojo8m7DpILIfiStOww&amp;bvm=bv.50768961,d.aWc">Hajime no Ippo</a> where Volg fights for a world title. And since I was looking to possibly play a game in real time, I got excited when I saw the chance to play someone from Russia. (For those who don&#8217;t understand the connection, Volg is a Russian boxer.) Before I knew it, I find myself neck deep in a complicated cross-fuseki game where all the fighting spirit I had been reading about had gotten into my blood and I was trying to strike at all of my opponent&#8217;s groups with everything I had.<br />
There was one particular moment (towards the end of the game) where I found myself in a rather precarious situation where I could either make certain of absolute life or leave it up to a capturing race. I know that the old me (and probably a lot of other players) would have probably chosen the sure route to life. However, it felt kind of surreal as I glanced at the position and realized that I could just tenuki because I already knew the end-result of the capturing race: Black would never win due to a shortage of liberties.<br />
The reason I&#8217;m writing about this is because I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve ever captured this kind of moment before in my journey. Do you know what I mean? It&#8217;s that moment where suddenly your training is starting to show its results and you feel as if something has dawned on you. In other words, all those tedious problems that I had practiced in the Level Up books had begun to show their true colors. Without much effort, I looked at my position and knew there was nothing to worry about.<br />
I know that I have been kind of out of it the past week; but what happened in yesterday&#8217;s game is a testament to my efforts before. And I think it&#8217;s just what I needed to kick my butt back into gear with my training. Time to revisit my training menu once again!</p>

I&#8217;ve recently taken an interest in boxing, and I have to say that the more I study it, the more I can&#8217;t help but see similarities between boxing and go. Here are a few off the top of my head:</p>
<ol>
<li>There are two players in each match.</li>
<li>Regardless of how badly each player might want to win, there can only be one victor at the end of the match.</li>
<li>Exchanging blows with your opponent is inevitable and necessary for a good match.</li>
<li>There are different styles of boxing that seem analogous the go styles as well (e.g., technician/point counter, infighter/fighting, etc.).</li>
</ol>
<p>But most importantly of all, <strong>those who rise to the top are those who are instinctively faithful to the fundamentals</strong>.<br />
After all, look at any boxer&#8217;s training regimen and what are you going to find? Running, jump rope, shadow boxing, combinations, sparring. Repeat. Repeat. Repeat. There might be a few deviations occasionally depending on what muscle groups they need to build for certain techniques, but the training menu almost always consists of the fundamentals. And what does a fight primarily consist of? The basics: jab, cross, hook, uppercut, jab, jab&#8230;<br />
So how is this relevant to go? Well, one topic that I know runs rampant throughout the community is the idea of getting stronger (especially for kyu players who want to reach dan level). And as I begin to study boxing, I can&#8217;t help but wonder what a go players training menu should look like? I mean sure, everyone will say do life and death problems, but that advice is so incredibly generic and subject to interpretation (as to how to study it) that I would guarantee that many players have gone astray and become frustrated with their progress because they couldn&#8217;t figure out what to do to keep getting better.<br />
I know that no one has a magical formula for getting better at go; but I think that there is more wisdom that can be offered from my study of boxing in terms of trying to discover better guidelines for designing a training menu for go. After all, it&#8217;s not about knowing the most complicated joseki or knowing the common trick plays, but to instead constantly improve the fundamentals.<br />
More on this as I continue researching and testing out different things&#8230;</p>

<ol>
<li>A very thorough review of the last five volumes of Level Up.</li>
<li>The game samples are starting to be rather complicated.</li>
<li>Continues to live up to the quality of problems and content you come to expect of the series.</li>
</ol>
[/expand]
[expand title=&#8221;Before I Read This Book&#8230;&#8221; trigclass=&#8221;expandTitle&#8221;]
<strong>My Abilities</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A mid to high SDK (single digit kyu) kyu who has read his fair share of go books and has a pretty strong foundation in the basics and teaching go.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>My Perspective</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Towards the end of the series, I noticed that I am actually starting to make mistakes here and there. So I&#8217;m going to try and take this a little slower in hopes of not making any mistakes.</li>
</ul>
[/expand]
[expand title=&#8221;My Review&#8221; trigclass=&#8221;expandTitle&#8221; expanded=&#8221;true&#8221;]
<strong>What did I enjoy about the book?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Spends quite a bit of time talking about go etiquette and one&#8217;s mindset/attitude when playing go.</li>
<li>Extremely thoroughly reviews the material you learned from Level Up 5 &#8211; 10.</li>
<li>The Next Moves problems also took a step up in difficult and complication. In fact, there were quite a few times where I was a little lost as to which was the correct answer.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What did I gain from reading this book?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Further realization of how, even at the what they consider DDK level, there are still holes in my reading abilities.</li>
<li>Reinforced understanding of the josekis that they have taught thus far.</li>
<li>Polished reading ability and improved analysis speed.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What style of teaching does the book use?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Curriculum Style
<ul>
<li>Content is organized into lessons, topics, or themes in order to facilitate learning.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Primary Learning Mechanism:
<ul>
<li>Practice problems</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Other Learning Mechanisms:
<ul>
<li>Cute and entertaining comics to teach and/or reinforce lessons.</li>
<li>Simple explantations that are accompanied by equally simple diagrams.</li>
<li>Samples of openings from professional games to further acclimate the reader to full games on a 19&#215;19 board.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What aspect can be improved on?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Page 55 #10 Solution is incorrect.</li>
<li>I enjoy the Next Move problems, but the lack of explanations for why certain moves are the correct answer leaves me a little unsettled. Don&#8217;t forget that this considers the fact that I have more knowledge than someone learning these things for the first time. So explanations for why a certain move (e.g., capping move) is correct would be very helpful.</li>
<li>The calculating endgame move value problems were actually rather difficult. I don&#8217;t feel like the previous volumes prepared me enough for these questions.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Is this book easy to read?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Yes. Other than the occasional article, the explanations are very easy short and easy to understand.</li>
</ul>

[expand title=&#8221;Before I Read This Book&#8230;&#8221; trigclass=&#8221;expandTitle&#8221;]
<strong>My Abilities</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A mid to high SDK (single digit kyu) kyu who has read his fair share of go books and has a pretty strong foundation in the basics and teaching go.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>My Perspective</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>I started making more errors in Level Up 9, but it definitely taught me some things about my instinctual reading abilities. So I&#8217;m looking forward to what the final installment has in store for me!.</li>
</ul>
[/expand]
[expand title=&#8221;My Review&#8221; trigclass=&#8221;expandTitle&#8221; expanded=&#8221;true&#8221;]
<strong>What did I enjoy about the book?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>I like how they correct basic misconceptions (that are rampant even in SDK games I&#8217;ve watched) like trying to block on the second line by hane early in the game.</li>
<li>I really like they show possible mistakes in joseki and teaches the reader how to handle them.</li>
<li>Introduces the reader to different techniques in winning capturing races.</li>
<li>Already starts to get the player to start being wary of trick plays, albeit not vey complicated ones.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What did I gain from reading this book?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A better understanding of the reason behind certain moves in joseki.</li>
<li>Firmer grasp of fundamental principles behind haengma (i.e. movement of the stones).</li>
<li>Greater comfort with capturing races and some of the techniques behind winning them.</li>
<li>Polished my reading abilities.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What style of teaching does the book use?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Curriculum Style
<ul>
<li>Content is organized into lessons, topics, or themes in order to facilitate learning.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Primary Learning Mechanism:
<ul>
<li>Practice problems</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Other Learning Mechanisms:
<ul>
<li>Cute and entertaining comics to teach and/or reinforce lessons.</li>
<li>Simple explantations that are accompanied by equally simple diagrams.</li>
<li>Samples of openings from professional games to further acclimate the reader to full games on a 19&#215;19 board.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What aspect can be improved on?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Page 95 Problem 6 has no solution aka impossible to solve.</li>
<li>On a rare occassion, the directions don&#8217;t quite match up to the problem (e.g., P.163 #4).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Is this book easy to read?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Yes. Other than the occasional article, the explanations are very easy short and easy to understand.</li>
</ul>
[/expand]
[expand title=&#8221;Recommended For&#8230;&#8221; trigclass=&#8221;expandTitle&#8221;]
<ul>
<li>Though the series is designed for kids, both kids and adults alike will be able to learn everything they need to know about playing go in a fun and entertaining way.</li>
<li>People who enjoy learning things in an easy to understand format and lots of opportunities to reinforce what they are learning.</li>

[expand title=&#8221;My Review&#8221; trigclass=&#8221;expandTitle&#8221; expanded=&#8221;true&#8221;]
<strong>What did I enjoy about the book?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>I really like the fact that they devote time to training the reader to recognize key stones.</li>
<li>I also really liked the fact that they subtly show proper use of the &#8220;empty triangle.&#8221;</li>
<li>Once again, they do a great job with life and death by training even the most basic skills like &#8220;Making a Living 4-Point Eye Shape.&#8221; It might seem easy, but unless it&#8217;s second nature, players might actually miss it in their actual games.</li>
<li>They really try and break down the flow of moves for you. For example, the different types of blocking.</li>
<li>They start teaching how to punish overplay cuts and whether or not you should cut! *mind blown*</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What did I gain from reading this book?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Continued polishing of my reading abilities.</li>
<li>Better understanding of why certain moves are considered &#8220;proper responses.&#8221;</li>

<li>Though I had a relatively easy time with the first volume, the problems in this book started to pose some difficulty for me.</li>

<strong>My Abilities</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>I&#8217;ve studied my fair share of life and death and can confidently say that I have a SDK (single digit kyu) level of life and death.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>My Perspective</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>After finishing the first volume, I was expecting this book to be rather easy to do as well.</li>

[expand title=&#8221;My Review&#8221; trigclass=&#8221;expandTitle&#8221; expanded=&#8221;true&#8221;]
<strong>What did I enjoy about the book?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>They have no reservation in terms of making you drill the same concept repeatedly.</li>
<li>There are so many concepts and shapes in this book that makes it very valuable.</li>
<li>The review sections (e.g., quizzes) and tests do a great job helping you determine if you actually learned the lessons prior.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What did I gain from reading this book?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A broader perspective on the different variations that can arise from life and death postiions.</li>
<li>A better grasp on techniques used to either kill or save a group.</li>
<li>The problems in this book actually posed some difficulty for me at times. Being that this is the second book, it didn&#8217;t take long for me to realize how weak my life and death skills really are.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What style of teaching does the book use?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Curriculum Style
<ul>
<li>Content is organized into lessons, topics, or themes in order to facilitate learning.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Teaching Mechanism:
<ul>
<li>Practice problems</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What aspect can be improved on?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>If I had to request one thing, it&#8217;s that I was hoping that the difficulty of the problems would be more gradual. The difficulty of the problems increased faster than I was expecting. Though this should be taken with a grain of salt since I have a feeling this is just an indicator of how weak my reading abilities are instead of it being the book&#8217;s problem.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Is this book easy to read?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Yes. Unless you can&#8217;t read English, it really doesn&#8217;t get any simpler.</li>
</ul>

[expandsub1 title=&#8221;1001 Life and Death Problems&#8221; trigclass=&#8221;cBookTitle&#8221;]
Compared to <a title="Book Review: 1001 Life and Death Problems" href="//book-review-1001-life-and-death-problems/">1001 Life and Death Problems</a>, this series does a better job hand-holing players new to life and death through the basic shapes and variations. On the other hand, I would say that in terms of polishing a player&#8217;s life and death skills, 1001 Life and Death Problems is still highly recommended. So to clarify, neither one trumps the other. Both can provide great value to a player&#8217;s life and death abilities.<br />

[expandsub2 title=&#8221;Elementary Go Series, Volume 4 &#8211; Life and Death&#8221; trigclass=&#8221;cBookTitle&#8221;]
While <a title="Book Review: Life and Death" href="//book-review-life-and-death/">Life and Death</a> does a great job providing a broad survey of different shapes through explanations and accompanying practice problems, this series uses the &#8220;learn it through experience&#8221; methodology. Though they may overlap on a good deal of material, I believe that they complement one another and would both be of great use to serious players wanting to improve their life and death.<br />
