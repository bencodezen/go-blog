				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>So you&#8217;ve decided to find out what responsibilities come with purchasing Yunzi stones, well don&#8217;t fear!  Here is an easy to follow guide. Enjoy!</em><br />
<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Why Take the Extra Time to Oil the Stones?</span></strong><br />
It&#8217;s true. You don&#8217;t HAVE to oil the stones.  Yunzi stones will naturally become glossier and smoother the more you play with them since you hands naturally produces oil.  I don&#8217;t know about you however, but I&#8217;d be an old man by the time it would take the stones to be pleasant to the touch with the oil my hand produces.  Not to mention that most of us don&#8217;t get to play as often in person as we&#8217;d like.  If you&#8217;re not interested in waiting 50 years for them to achieve the effect that oiling can get in an hour or two, then you&#8217;ll want to read the entire guide.  For those who don&#8217;t care, then all you need is up till Phase 1.<br />
<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Materials (Depends on whether you want to oil the stones simultaneously)</span></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Yunzi stones</li>
<li>Dishwashing Soap</li>
<li>~15 or ~30 drops of Light machine oil (e.g. sewing machine oil)
<ul>
<li><strong>Note: Do NOT use oils such as vegetable (oil/canola) because they will go RANCID over time.</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>1 or 2 One-gallon freezer bag(s) (depending if you want to oil them at the same time)</li>
<li>2 Towels (Large enough to wrap around all of one color at once, otherwise you need more)</li>
<li>Non-metal strain (something to drain water but it CANNOT be metallic)
<ul>
<li>Metallic strainers can cause a lot of scratches on your stones.  So avoid it on the safe side.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<div style="text-align: center;"><a style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;" href="https://i2.wp.com/1.bp.blogspot.com/_R3zwHD97QhU/TK3LkQyMtVI/AAAAAAAAAS8/K2Zh3tTlfdE/s1600/IMG_1579.JPG"><img src="https://i2.wp.com/1.bp.blogspot.com/_R3zwHD97QhU/TK3LkQyMtVI/AAAAAAAAAS8/K2Zh3tTlfdE/s200/IMG_1579.JPG?resize=150%2C200" alt="" width="150" height="200" border="0" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></div>
<div style="text-align: center;"></div>
<p>Most of us have most of the materials above except the sewing machine oil, and let me tell you that sewing machine oil is NOT expensive.  I got mine (pictured above) at a Jo-Ann&#8217;s Fabric for only $2.95 + tax.  Not to mention you only need like 20 drops or so of it (a little bit more if you oiling the stones simultaneously).  So if someone is willing to let you borrow theirs, no worries about using up their oil.</p>
<div style="text-align: left;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Advice Prior to Starting</span></strong></div>
<ol>
<li>Although most of the steps are relatively simple, drying the oil off the stones at the end will be particularly time consuming.  This guide assumes that you will be doing both colors in the same sitting and by your little lonesome (as I did), so estimate at least an hour and a half for the whole process.  (Two if you want to be extra attentive to your stones).
<ul>
<li>I&#8217;ve broken the guide into three phases in case you are short on time.  And of course, if you want to break it up further. Just do the colors on separate days.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I would advise to keep the colors separated throughout the process in order to easily keep track of your work.  I suggest doing the white stones first since they take more effort and are not as fun to do as the black ones.</li>
<li>Just to reiterate, DO NOT use vegetable oils.  They will go RANCID.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Procedure</span></strong></p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><strong>PHASE 1 BEGIN</strong></div>
<p><strong></strong>#1. So here&#8217;s what my stones looked like when I first got them.  The stones all come with a white powdery substance in order to minimize scratching and chipping during shipping.  As you&#8217;ll see, the black stones show the powder really well while the white ones&#8230; not so much.</p>
<div style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;" href="https://i0.wp.com/3.bp.blogspot.com/_R3zwHD97QhU/TK3LNXMe_kI/AAAAAAAAASQ/Vsat7uT7dOY/s1600/IMG_1552.JPG"><img src="https://i1.wp.com/3.bp.blogspot.com/_R3zwHD97QhU/TK3LNXMe_kI/AAAAAAAAASQ/Vsat7uT7dOY/s320/IMG_1552.JPG?resize=320%2C240" alt="" width="320" height="240" border="0" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></div>
<div style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;" href="https://i1.wp.com/2.bp.blogspot.com/_R3zwHD97QhU/TK3LRkf4GvI/AAAAAAAAASY/_0yAX9SzrFA/s1600/IMG_1562.JPG"><img src="https://i1.wp.com/2.bp.blogspot.com/_R3zwHD97QhU/TK3LRkf4GvI/AAAAAAAAASY/_0yAX9SzrFA/s320/IMG_1562.JPG?resize=320%2C240" alt="" width="320" height="240" border="0" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></div>
<div style="text-align: center;"><em>See? Very apparent.</em><br />
<em><br />
</em></div>
<div style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;" href="https://i0.wp.com/4.bp.blogspot.com/_R3zwHD97QhU/TK3LTh6Q-HI/AAAAAAAAASc/j1Au8ibEhCw/s1600/IMG_1563.JPG"><img src="https://i2.wp.com/4.bp.blogspot.com/_R3zwHD97QhU/TK3LTh6Q-HI/AAAAAAAAASc/j1Au8ibEhCw/s320/IMG_1563.JPG?resize=320%2C240" alt="" width="320" height="240" border="0" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></div>
<div style="text-align: center;"><em>Not so apparent.</em></div>
<div style="text-align: center;"><em><br />
</em></div>
<div style="text-align: left;">#3. You essentially need a sink (or bowl) filled with enough water to easily submerge all of one color at once.</div>
<div style="text-align: center;"><a style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;" href="https://i2.wp.com/3.bp.blogspot.com/_R3zwHD97QhU/TK3Lb8BAxGI/AAAAAAAAASs/-pRpxHjfUSI/s1600/IMG_1571.JPG"><img src="https://i1.wp.com/3.bp.blogspot.com/_R3zwHD97QhU/TK3Lb8BAxGI/AAAAAAAAASs/-pRpxHjfUSI/s320/IMG_1571.JPG?resize=320%2C240" alt="" width="320" height="240" border="0" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></div>
<div style="text-align: center;"><em>I forgot to take one before washing, so the white ones are in there right now.</em></div>
<p>#4. Then you&#8217;ll add a moderate amount of dishwashing soap to get it nice and bubbly.  This was about how much I had.  Don&#8217;t put too much, since it&#8217;ll make washing off a pain later.</p>
<div style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;" href="https://i2.wp.com/3.bp.blogspot.com/_R3zwHD97QhU/TK3LWbSIOEI/AAAAAAAAASg/7CkN6pT7u0Y/s1600/IMG_1567.JPG"><img src="https://i0.wp.com/3.bp.blogspot.com/_R3zwHD97QhU/TK3LWbSIOEI/AAAAAAAAASg/7CkN6pT7u0Y/s320/IMG_1567.JPG?resize=320%2C240" alt="" width="320" height="240" border="0" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></div>
<div style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div>
<div style="clear: both; text-align: left;">#5. To wash your stones, submerge them in the soapy water and hand wash them.  You don&#8217;t need to be particularly detailed with this part, but try and make sure you wash off any obvious white powder since it&#8217;ll get in the way of oiling later.  Once you finish with the soap, rinse them off with water.  Dump them out onto the towel, and dry them off well before oiling.</div>
<div style="clear: both; text-align: left;"></div>
<div style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;" href="https://i2.wp.com/2.bp.blogspot.com/_R3zwHD97QhU/TK3LZ1YIEUI/AAAAAAAAASo/yp9bp6xif_M/s1600/IMG_1570.JPG"><img src="https://i2.wp.com/2.bp.blogspot.com/_R3zwHD97QhU/TK3LZ1YIEUI/AAAAAAAAASo/yp9bp6xif_M/s320/IMG_1570.JPG?resize=320%2C240" alt="" width="320" height="240" border="0" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></div>

<div style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><em>White stones after the wash.  The water makes them look glossy.</em></div>
<div style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><em><br />
</em></div>
<div style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;" href="https://i0.wp.com/4.bp.blogspot.com/_R3zwHD97QhU/TK3LinuOobI/AAAAAAAAAS4/zT4U1MJz_mc/s1600/IMG_1578.JPG"><img src="https://i1.wp.com/4.bp.blogspot.com/_R3zwHD97QhU/TK3LinuOobI/AAAAAAAAAS4/zT4U1MJz_mc/s320/IMG_1578.JPG?resize=320%2C240" alt="" width="320" height="240" border="0" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></div>
<div style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><em>All of the stones after the wash</em></div>
<div style="text-align: center;"><strong>PHASE 1 END</strong><br />
<strong>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;</strong></div>
<div style="text-align: center;"><strong>PHASE 2 BEGIN</strong></div>
<div style="clear: both; text-align: left;">#6. To oil your stones, take your gallon bag and put 12 drops of oil in there.  Now most guides out there recommend 12, but others want to put a few more in just to make sure they are extra oil.  It won&#8217;t hurt as far as I can tell, but you will want to pay a bit more attention to drying your stones afterwards so no excess oils stay on.  Then throw whichever color (I recommend white), and then gently move the stones around making sure to spread the oil around to all of the stones.</div>
<div style="clear: both; text-align: left;"></div>
<div style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;" href="https://i2.wp.com/3.bp.blogspot.com/_R3zwHD97QhU/TK3LmJ_4PwI/AAAAAAAAATA/Ays7OsRfJ9Y/s1600/IMG_1585.JPG"><img src="https://i2.wp.com/3.bp.blogspot.com/_R3zwHD97QhU/TK3LmJ_4PwI/AAAAAAAAATA/Ays7OsRfJ9Y/s320/IMG_1585.JPG?resize=240%2C320" alt="" width="240" height="320" border="0" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></div>
<div style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div>
<div style="clear: both; text-align: left;">#7. If you are short on time, this is where you take your second one-gallon freezer bag and oil that up as well with ~12 drops of oil and throw in the other color.  Mix that bag up just like you did the first one, and then you can let both bags sit.  (In case you are wondering if it is bad to do that, my dad let his sit for about 48 hours and they&#8217;re just fine.)</div>
<div style="clear: both; text-align: left;"></div>
<div style="clear: both; text-align: left;">Note: If you are only going to use one freezer bag, then you have two choices:  dry off the color which is oiled first, and then oil the other one&#8230; OR&#8230; if your stones are not too large for the bag, put both in at once.</div>
<div style="clear: both; text-align: left;"></div>
<div style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><strong>PHASE 2 END</strong></div>
<div style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><strong>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;</strong></div>
<div style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><strong>PHASE 3 BEGIN</strong></div>
<p><strong></strong><br />
<strong></strong></p>
<div style="font-weight: normal; text-align: center; margin: 0px;">
<div style="text-align: left;"><strong></strong>#8. This is the most tedious and time consuming phase.  You&#8217;ll begin by emptying out your stones in small groups at a time.  This will help you keep track of which ones are done and this will also permit you the proper towel space to dry your oiled stones without them falling everywhere.  Again, I recommend starting with white since black is very pleasant to do since you&#8217;ll see a very obvious change in them.</div>
</div>
<p>#9.  Then you&#8217;ll go ahead and dry them off.  It is important that you don&#8217;t leave any excess oil on them because it will cause your stones/bowls to smell and the excess oil will most likely damage your board over time.  If you pick a properly dried off stones with your hand, and then pick up one with excess oil, you&#8217;ll know the difference.  So just be disciplined about this phase.  The white stones will need more individual attention since it is harder to tell whether there is still excess oil on them.</p>
<div style="clear: both; text-align: left;"></div>
<div style="clear: both; text-align: left;">Tip: As you dry them, try to keep drying the stones with the same area of towel so that it will increase the oiling effect.</div>
<div style="clear: both; text-align: left;"></div>
<div style="clear: both; text-align: left;">Tip: Also, if you can get a friend to help.  This will speed the process a LOT.  Just make sure they are attentive about the excess oils on the stones, otherwise you might as well do it yourself.</div>
<div style="clear: both; text-align: left;"></div>
<div style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><strong>PHASE 3 END</strong></div>
<div style="clear: both; text-align: left;"></div>
<div style="clear: both; text-align: left;">#10. Finished product.  You have no idea how good it felt to take these pictures.  I felt so proud.</div>
