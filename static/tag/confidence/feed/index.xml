				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A couple of nights ago, frozensoul mentioned something to me that really struck me.</p>
<blockquote><p>My mind is my greatest opponent.</p></blockquote>
<p>Yup. You read that right. Instead of being trounced by opponents better than me or making dumb mistakes, I often end up out-reading myself.<br />
What do I mean by this? I&#8217;m talking about being fearful of potential aji in X area and adding unnecessary moves &#8220;just in case.&#8221; Now this might sound reasonable, but let&#8217;s think about this one moment. If you are adding a move to an area that doesn&#8217;t require it, are you not essentially passing your turn?<br />
To further illustrate my point, take the following problem:<br />
<figure id="attachment_4139" style="width: 190px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2013/10/deadgroup.png"><img class=" wp-image-4139 " alt="Black to play." src="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2013/10/deadgroup.png?resize=190%2C189" width="190" height="189" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Black to play.</figcaption></figure>
Is there anyone out there who would suggest that Black capture the White stones &#8220;just to in case?&#8221; Absolutely not. Because any player above 12 kyu would know that it would be completely absurd to do anything but tenuki.<br />
&#8220;But wait Ben! Not all positions are as clear cut as the problem you presented! What happens if you&#8217;re wrong and then you lose because you think you can tenuki when in fact you really can&#8217;t?!&#8221;<br />
Well, to that I have only one question: <strong>Are you trying to get stronger or simply keep winning against opponents of the same strength?</strong><br />
Yes. It would suck if you tenuki when you actually needed a move and then lost a game; but guess what, that is part of growing and learning so that we can get stronger. We make mistakes. We fall. We get back up. We learn. We grow. We get stronger. And the cycle goes on and on&#8230;<br />
So the next time you feel like you&#8217;re in a questionable position, do your best with the reading ability you have and then have faith in your moves. You will make quite a few mistakes along the road, but I assure you that it will be a heck of a lot better than defending against imaginary aji.</p>

Last week, I was playing a game when other players started showing up to watch the game. My opponent then remarked, &#8220;Everyone is here to see me lose.&#8221; And then I promptly replied, &#8220;You&#8217;ve got it wrong. They&#8217;re here to see me lose.&#8221; Though it was said in a joking manner that was also supposed to be humble, it wasn&#8217;t until after the game that a comment made by a visitng dan player struck me: &#8220;Confidence is worth two stones.&#8221;<br />
It got me thinking about my whole approach to the game, or perhaps life in general. With the way I&#8217;ve been brought up, it&#8217;s expected that one be humble and not be cocky or overconfident. However, I started to wonder whether or not I ended up taking this mentality too far and becoming self-deprecating instead. In other words, even though I would say things like, &#8220;No no, I&#8217;m a weak player&#8221; as a way of being humble; I may have actually been planting seeds of doubt in myself this entire time.<br />
Now to be clear, I&#8217;m not saying that one should prance around saying how they&#8217;ll win every game and rub it in their opponent&#8217;s faces. &#8220;Look at me! I&#8217;m so great!&#8221; I mean sure, sometimes the cockiness works as a placebo effect and some people end up becoming &#8220;stronger,&#8221; but then everyone thinks you&#8217;re an asshole and that is way worse than being a weak player. So instead, I will stop using negative statements and stop worrying about what other people think.<br />
With each stone I play, I will simply aim to play the best go that I can. That is all that matters.</p>
