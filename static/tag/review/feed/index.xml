				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 id="introduction" style="text-align: center;">Introduction</h2>
<p>For this week, I’ve decided to honor a request made by my friend Rob who asked that I review the game that was the cause for my post on being confused. Though I haven’t been commenting on games from YSD, I’ve decided to make an exception for this one.<br />
Just to note though, any specific insight that was taught by Inseong is withheld from the commentary in order to respect other member’s paid memberships. So while I will comment on what I understood on my own, any specific details will be omitted in this review.<br />
Hope you enjoy this review!<br />

no,Category,Good,Bad<br />
1,Opening,<strong>Move 39</strong> &#8211; This move is the only one I’m “proud” of since it took full advantage of White’s mistake in this joseki.,<strong>Move 19 and 29</strong> &#8211; Both these moves were bad since I was unable to punish White for his mistake in the joseki.<br />
2,Attack and Defense,<strong>Move 97</strong> &#8211; Recognizing that my group was in trouble and defending it was a rather proud moment since I might have normally left it alone.,<strong>Move 19 and 29</strong> &#8211; These moves are worth mentioning again since they were missed opportunities to attack White early on.<br />
3,Shape,<strong>Move 65</strong> &#8211; Getting this shape point allowed me the chance to start gaining the upper hand in this game.,&#8221;<strong>Move 95</strong> &#8211; Though it looks like good shape here, I consider this a bad move since the shape gave me little value on the board as a whole.&#8221;<br />
4,Strategy,<strong>Move 53</strong> &#8211; Trying to remove White’s base in order to attack White seems to be a key moment to why I was able to gain an advantage in the game., <strong>Move 93–95</strong> &#8211; Continuing to try and kill it in such a direct manner however was a mistake.<br />
5,Overall Reading,<strong>Move 271</strong> &#8211; Being able to calmly choose the correct move instead of the automatic move I might have made normally was another proud moment.,<strong>Move 111</strong> &#8211; Connecting here out of fear still shows the immaturity of my reading.<br />
6,Endgame,<strong>Move 143</strong> &#8211; Recognizing that I could start the endgame since I was ahead was something I was unable to do before.,<strong>Move 237</strong> &#8211; Defending directly here was a mistake that gave White three extra points.<br />

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 style="text-align: center;">Introduction</h2>
<p>About a week ago, there was a bit of discussion about the importance of endgame. Now while I would never even begin to propose that endgame is not important or can&#8217;t make a huge difference, I was saying how I didn&#8217;t think studying it would serve kyu players as much as say dan players.<br />
Ironically, the game featured this week was played shortly after the discussion and happened to feature endgame as the shining star of the game. In addition, this game is also a good example of competing moyos and how critical points in shape and boundaries can make a huge difference in the resulting outcome. Hope you enjoy this review!<br />

<h2 style="text-align: center;"><strong>One Point Lesson</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: center;">When you&#8217;re really behind, your only hope is to complicate the game and push your opponent&#8217;s abilities to the absolute limit.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Game Summary</h2>

no,Category,Good,Bad<br />
1,Opening,<strong>Move 11</strong> &#8211; Decisively ignoring White&#8217;s extension to play on the right inside seemed like the correct move.,<strong>Move 35</strong> &#8211; This was a bad move that allowed White to get a nice result on the upper right.<br />
2,Attack and Defense,<strong>Move 111</strong> &#8211; Ignoring White to defend my group was an important step to giving me a chance to make a comeback.,<strong>Move 80</strong> &#8211; Letting White attack my group like this was very painful. It could have been awful if White had continued his attack.<br />
3,Shape,<strong>Move 147</strong> &#8211; Being able to find this point in the midst of near death was another proud moment for me.,<strong>Move 48</strong> &#8211; Letting White get this shape point was unbelievably painful.<br />
4,Strategy,<strong>Move 115</strong> &#8211; Ignoring White&#8217;s approach on my corner to try and reverse the game was importantly to try and reverse the game.,<strong>Move 47</strong> &#8211; Trying to take the corner instead of expanding my moyo was a pretty big mistake.<br />
5,Overall Reading,<strong>Move 151</strong> &#8211; Being able to read out this attachment almost instantly was a proud moment for me.,<strong>Move 63</strong> &#8211; This was so painfully obvious to my opponent. Should have saved it for later.<br />
6,Endgame,<strong>Move 161</strong> &#8211; Taking my sente to connect here is probably what eventually pushed my opponent to resign later.,<strong>Move 86</strong> &#8211; Seeing White fly into my area like that was so painful. It nearly ended the game.<br />

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Introduction</strong></h2>
<p>This week marks the reboot of the Monday Go Meditation (MGM) series! In the spirit of continuous improvement, I felt it was time to give this series an upgrade in order to continue striving for the perfect weekly column for my game reviews. Here are some enhancements that I have made:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>All MGM&#8217;s will now include the game summary table. </strong>After doing the <a title="Thursday Go Tygem: Game 07" href="//thursday-go-tygem-game-07/">Thursday Go Tygem</a> series for a bit, it seemed that the table was a popular aspect of it since it allowed me to provide a broad overview of the game in the event you don&#8217;t have time to go through the entire game. As a result, I felt it would be a great addition to MGM.</li>
<li>A<strong>ll games featured here will be 2 weeks old at the most.</strong> One thing I noticed is that the games being posted were starting to be a few weeks if not a month old, which is not good since it does not reflect my current progress as a player. Though this makes it a little harder for me since I can&#8217;t prepare as many game reviews in advance, I am confident this change will make this weekly column much more viable.</li>
<li><strong>The commentary will also be taking on a more &#8220;stream of consciousness&#8221; type narrative</strong> in order to provide more context in terms of how I was feeling throughout the game and the emotions and thoughts I wrestled with. As a result, the game reviews will not be heavily focused on explaining things in depth or showing numerous variations since that is more of a teaching-oriented type review (which I do plan on featuring here in the future, but don&#8217;t feel it&#8217;s appropriate for MGM).</li>
</ol>
<p>So in light of all that, this week&#8217;s game features an even game against a 3k that I played last week before going on my losing streak. Haha. It&#8217;s a great game that illustrates how emotions can really cloud your judgment when it comes to the actual board position and how you&#8217;re really doing.<br />
As always, it would be greatly appreciated if you could let me know what you think about these new changes. Hope you enjoy the review!<br />

<h2 style="text-align: center;"><strong>One Point Lesson</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: center;">Using emotions to judge whether you are ahead or behind is typically a recipe for poor decision making.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span id="more-5470"></span></p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Game Summary</strong></h2>
[table colwidth=&#8221;50|140|375|375&#8243; colalign=&#8221;center|center|center|center&#8221;]
no,Category,Good,Bad<br />
1,Opening, <strong>Move 24:</strong> This move really gave me a nice advantage in the opening. See game commentary for a more in-depth explanations., <strong>Move 19:</strong> I’m not sure that I handled Black’s response here correctly. Perhaps the tenuki was a mistake.<br />
2,Attack and Defense, <strong>Move 50:</strong> This diagonal jump was a new move I tried that seemed to do a great job keeping pressure on Black., <strong>Move 58:</strong> This move was too defensive and failed to keep pressure on Black.<br />
3,Shape, Nothing worth mentioning., <strong>Move 64:</strong> Not connecting and letting Black push through to connect his groups together was a travesty.~~<strong>Move 52:</strong> The hane was bad and left too many cutting points for me to worry about later.<br />
4,Strategy, <strong>Move 44:</strong> Leaving the cutting point to play continue my expansion of the top seemed to work out well overall., <strong>Move 86-88:</strong> The push and cut was a risky play since Black had a number of forcing moves to counter the strategy.<br />
5,Overall Reading, Nothing to brag about since most sequences I read out usually had one fatal flaw that was luckily overlooked by my opponent., <strong>Move 76-85:</strong> This sequence was shameful since it was a result of wishful thinking and only made things worse.<br />
6,Endgame, <strong>Move 120:</strong> Ignoring Black’s move to start my own endgame sequence was a proud moment for me.,<strong> Move 104:</strong> This jump may not be as big as I thought. Perhaps blocking at M2 would have been better.<br />

<p>After my third game in Yunguseng Dojang, I became a lot more comfortable playing White. Maybe it&#8217;s because I&#8217;ve started to really appreciate having komi. Either way, I&#8217;m glad to have broken away from my fear of playing White.<br />
This game was the first one I played after being dispelled of that anxiety of playing White. And believe it or not, it was actually a rather calm game where no dramatic battles of life and death occurred. See for yourself below!<br />

1,Opening,<strong>Move 30</strong> &#8211; Using the knight’s move to gain sente from the 3-3 invasion was a big reason why I could get an advantage this game., Surprisingly I cannot find any fault with my opening. Please let me know if you spot something I missed!<br />
2,Middle Game,&#8221;Overall it was quite peaceful and neither played created any big weak groups, but I managed to take more territory overall.&#8221;, N/A<br />
3,Fighting,&#8221;To my surprise, there wasn’t much fighting in this game.”, N/A<br />
4,Endgame,<strong>Move 164-175</strong> &#8211; I was proud to find this sequence that reduced a lot of Black’s points in sente., Hard to find any big flaws in my endgame. It seemed I was stronger than my opponent in this area.<br />
5,Overall Reading,<strong>Move 100</strong> &#8211; Finding this preparatory move for the resulting sequence was a big step forward for me.,Move 52 &#8211; I completely missed the double atari when I played here. Shame on me.<br />
6,Strategy,<strong>Move 78</strong> &#8211; Realizing that it would be difficult to continue severely attacking the Black group and simply cashing in on territory is a move I used to find it impossible to do.,&#8221;<strong>Move 52</strong> &#8211; Even if we assume this move works, there wasn’t much strategic value here since White did not have great potential in the center nor a weak group to attack.&#8221;<br />

<p>With this week, we continue on with Game #4 of Maaike&#8217;s <a title="Maaike's April Challenge" href="http://www.thegochallenge.blogspot.com.au/2014/04/april-challenge.html">April Challenge</a>, which also happens to be the first round of the <a title="1st Washington Open Baduk Championship — Part I" href="//1st-washington-open-baduk-championship-part/">1st Washington Open Baduk Championship</a> that I participated in a month or so ago. Though it ended up being a completely crazy roller coaster of a match, it is an excellent example of how volatile games can be in tournaments. Because of the pressure of competition, players will look for any slack move or advantage they can to reverse the game. With that said, hang on to your seats cause this is going to be a bumpy one!<br />

<p>This opponent was a unique one since he thought longer than I did and took his time. He actually ended up in byoyomi early on in the game and used most of his byoyomi time which is really weird for Tygem since most players I&#8217;ve encountered play pretty quickly and I&#8217;m the one usually running out of time. Overall though, I felt that I was in control for most of the game. Hopefully you&#8217;ll agree! And if I&#8217;m totally wrong, please let me know!<br />

no,Category,Good,Bad<br />
1,Opening,<strong>Move 9-11</strong>: Ignoring White in the upper left was good in that I did not unnecessarily strengthen my opponent by trying to struggle.,&#8221;Other than the inconsistency of Move 21, I don’t see any egregious errors in regards to the opening.&#8221;<br />
2,Middle Game,<strong>Move 39-63</strong>: It felt like I did a good job attacking White while gaining nice 4th line territory on the right.,Can’t see any major mistakes at the moment.<br />
3,Fighting,Overall the fighting seemed to be in my favor most of the game. Nothing terribly complicated.,Didn’t see any real weaknesses in my fighting this game.<br />
4,Endgame,<strong>Move 219</strong>: Ignoring White’s atari at M1 to make an extra point showed I was not making automatic moves and trying to look for bigger plays.,<strong>Move 164</strong>: Letting what get the diagonal here first was rough.<br />
5,Overall Reading,<strong>Move 121</strong>: I was proud to be able to read out this attachment and know it could not be cut without some loss to White.,<strong>Move 70</strong>: I could sense there was double cut aji here but failed to read it out properly.<br />
6,Strategy,<strong>Move 81</strong>: Sacrificing the F3 group in exchange for breaking up the left side seemed to show good judgment.,&#8221;<strong>Move 21</strong>: Though successful, the 3-3 invasion seems to be contrary to my initial plan at making a moyo. So negative points for inconsistency.&#8221;<br />

<p>With this week, we continue on with Game #3 of Maaike&#8217;s <a title="Maaike's April Challenge" href="http://www.thegochallenge.blogspot.com.au/2014/04/april-challenge.html">April Challenge</a>! In this game, I am playing a friend who is known for crazy plays and lots of trick plays. So whenever we play a game, I never know what to really expect. Haha. And since my challenge was to play calmly, I thought that my friend would be a great person to test out myself.<br />

<h2 style="text-align: center;"><strong>One Point Lesson</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: center;">When your group is weak, check to see if your opponent has any weak groups that you can counter attack instead of simply trying to run or make life.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 style="text-align: center;">Introduction</h2>
<p>Before this game, I had been getting white in most of my even games and had trouble playing properly. Games were often very rushed and I could hardly play a good game as White. However, after listening to Inseong talk about his views on playing White, I gave it a lot of thought and tried to get in a similar mindset.<br />
This game is the first game that I felt successful when playing White. Not only was my game not rushed and ill-conceived, but I felt like I was able to maintain control for most of the game. Hopefully you&#8217;ll agree! Enjoy the game.<br />

no,Category,Good,Bad<br />
1,Opening,<strong>Move 20</strong> &#8211; I liked this extension in regards to the whole board since it seems like a proactive move., <strong>Move 9</strong> &#8211; I am unfamiliar with this position. Need to learn more about it in the future.<br />
2,Middle Game, <strong>Move 44</strong> &#8211; The cap started a sequence that allowed me to take the initiative in the middle game.,<strong>Move 104</strong> &#8211; Bad move that could have cost me the game.<br />
3,Fighting, <strong>Move 112</strong> &#8211; Ignoring Black to play here showed good fighting spirit., Can&#8217;t say that any of the fighting was bad for me this game. Correct me if I&#8217;m wrong though!<br />
4,Endgame, Not Applicable, Not Applicable<br />
5,Overall Reading, &#8220;<strong>Move 106</strong> &#8211; Though the reading is relatively simple, I was happy that I could read it out instantly with no doubt in my mind.&#8221;,<strong>Move 104</strong> &#8211; Worth mentioning twice. This was an overplay. I am lucky Black let me off the hook and made life instead.<br />

<p>With this week, we continue on with Game #2 of Maaike&#8217;s <a title="Maaike's April Challenge" href="http://www.thegochallenge.blogspot.com.au/2014/04/april-challenge.html">April Challenge</a>! Even though the game ended up culminating into a rather large capturing race, I felt that my decisions leading up to it were calm as a whole. Instead of trying to turn it into a capturing race from the beginning, there were a number of times when I would offer the possibility of a peaceful resolution. So in that regard, I believe that I was successful in playing a calm game. Hopefully you&#8217;ll think so too!<br />

<p>Though I would have ideally preferred these games to have come out during the month of April, I&#8217;m happy to finally feature my games from Maaike&#8217;s <a title="April Challenge" href="http://www.thegochallenge.blogspot.com.au/2014/04/april-challenge.html">April&#8217;s Challenge</a>.* This game was Game #1 for Maaike&#8217;s April&#8217;s Challenge. Though this might seem like an aggressive game, I think that I was successful in learning to curb my bloodlust and let White live instead of killing and instead taking large profit in the center. Hopefully you&#8217;ll agree. Enjoy!<br />
*<em>For those who haven&#8217;t read it, the basic challenge was to &#8220;get out of your comfort zone.&#8221; So for myself, I chose to try and play more calmly and territorially (however I had not yet studied <a href="http://www.slateandshell.com/SSYZ009.html">Master Play: The Territorial Style of Kitani Minoru and Cho Chikun</a> yet, so I tried to achieve it based on what I knew at the time).</em><br />
