				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So I&#8217;m back online!  With two online games under my belt today, I&#8217;m feeling pretty good.</p>
<ol>
<li>I played against a human AkiraWeiqi (22 kyu).  It was a good battle.  We both made some careless errors, but man it is different playing against a handicap.  I&#8217;m so used to taking handicaps/even games that seeing stones on the board was like WHOA!  I won by a slight margin, but I&#8217;ll have to have someone review it to see if he might have been able to close the gap.</li>
<li>Second game was against the LiberyBot (14 kyu), and that I thought I played relatively well.  I lost by 5.5 moku, but I think it was largely due to a huge reading error in one of my larger groups which then resulted in its death.  Sigh&#8230;. need more practice.</li>
</ol>
<p>Okay.  So&#8230; in terms of my study regimen&#8230;. here&#8217;s what we&#8217;ll be looking at.</p>
<ul>
<li>Life and Death Problem</li>
<li>Reading about Go Strategy</li>
<li>General Go Problems</li>
<li>Play one serious game</li>
<li>Replay at least part of a pro game</li>
</ul>
<p>Let&#8217;s see where that takes me.  Onwards!</p>
