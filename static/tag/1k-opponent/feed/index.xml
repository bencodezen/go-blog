				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Today I added another notch to my losses. It was a 2 stone handicap game against a 1k and I completely goofed at the end. No reason I shouldn&#8217;t have won, but I just couldn&#8217;t see it through.<br />

<p>And the funny thing is that this trend seems to be consistent with other things I tried to switch my attention to momentarily (like League of Legends). Part of me wonders whether I&#8217;ve acquired some sort of &#8220;losing&#8221; mindset; but on second though, it&#8217;s rather unlikely since I know that starting off any game being like &#8220;I&#8217;m going to lose anyways&#8221; is a recipe for disaster.<br />
As this is the first day in my quest to return back to my origins, I shouldn&#8217;t be surprised that things are not much different than yesterday. There&#8217;s a big mix of frustration, loss, and clarity all at the time. And to be honest, it feels as if stumbling through the dark blindly reaching for anything I can hold on to to feel like I&#8217;m making progress. I have no idea if it&#8217;s going to get me where I want to go, but it certainly seems to beat standing still.<br />
On the bright side, I&#8217;m glad I&#8217;m not gambling any time soon.</p>
