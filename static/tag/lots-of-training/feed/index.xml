				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>This has been an interesting week that was fraught with frustration, but paired with deep introspection that yielded something valuable for me as a whole. Although it took me some time to realize, there was a growing tendency for me to rush in both Go and my life in general. So, I am grateful that go has once again provided an avenue for me to improve my life as a whole once again. Beginning the path back to zen will have a number of butterfly effects, but I have a feeling they will be far from regrettable. =)</p>
<h2>Games</h2>
<ul>
<li><span style="line-height: 13px;">KGS &#8211; 4 games (2 wins : 2 losses)</span></li>
<li>DGS &#8211; 1 ongoing game</li>
<li>Nova &#8211; 2 ongoing games</li>
</ul>
<h2>Training</h2>
<ul>
<li><span style="line-height: 13px;">Finished <em>Essential Life &amp; Death: Vol. 1 </em>and started<em> Vol. 2</em>.</span></li>
<li>Finished reading <em>The Chinese Opening</em> by Yuan Zhou.</li>
<li>Started working on <em>Attacking and Defending Moyos </em>by Zeijst and Bozulich.</li>
<li>Started reading <em>Modern Master Games, Vol. 1 </em>by Zeijst and Bozulich.</li>
<li>Started working on <em>Positional Judgment </em>by Cho Chikun.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Lessons Learned</h2>
<ol>
<li>If I feel like I am strapped for time or rushed before I even start a game, it&#8217;s probably best to not even bother playing.</li>
<li>To refrain from kyu tunnel vision, I need to look at the board with fresh eyes after every move.</li>
</ol>
