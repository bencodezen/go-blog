<h2 style="text-align: center;">Basic Techniques of Go</h2>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> This book can be considered a broad coverage of the following: opening principles, lots of handicap go advice, brief survey of tesujis, and a brief survey of endgame. The material is quite dense and contrary to what many descriptions say about this book, I vehemently disagree with the recommending this book for beginners. It is suited for intermediate to advanced players. Beginners steer clear of this book!<br />

[expand title=&#8221;Before I Read This Book&#8230;&#8221; trigclass=&#8221;expandTitle&#8221;]
I bought this book way back when I started go. I felt like I was completely lost when I first tried to read it, so here I am a couple years later trying to read it once more. What I was expecting when I bought it was a book on a broad coverage of techniques one would find with go. Now that I am much stronger and more experienced, I am still hoping for a survey of techniques along with clarification on their usage.<br />
[/expand]
[expand title=&#8221;My Review&#8221; trigclass=&#8221;expandTitle&#8221; expanded=&#8221;true&#8221;]
When I first opened this book, I was a little surprised to be greeted by a chapter on opening theory. After all, this is a book on technique is it not? I recognize that selecting the correct opening move is a &#8220;technique&#8221; in a sense, but in my mind I was thinking more along the lines of haengma (i.e., the movement of the stones) or something else.<br />
With that aside though, the first chapter does cover quite a bit regarding the opening. While this is good in one sense, I still found it to be a bit dense and cannot imagine any beginner trying to work through this and achieve much success.<br />
And the next thing I know, the book is going full blown into handicap go coverage. All I could think when I kept reading was, &#8220;EH?!&#8221; I understand that these handicap go principles and techniques being described might seem &#8220;basic,&#8221; but even as a single digit kyu, even I was raising my eyebrows as I was trying to figure out what was going on. The diagrams were often rather complicated and required multiple readings just to get a sense of what was going on. After you work through a rather substantial amount of handicap go material, you finally get to the tesuji section.<br />
Here, I finally got a sense of what I was hoping for. A broad survey of different techniques used in different situations. With each tesuji, there is a brief explanation along with an example and an obvious variation or two that players might question. So while some of the material in here was a bit advanced and hard to grasp based on simple reading, this felt more like the book I was looking for when purchasing this book. And for those wondering about the problems, they are overall intermediate level and not very beginner friendly.<br />
For the last chapter, the reader is introduced to the importance of endgame. And while I would consider myself to at least be moderately versed when it comes to endgame, this was a rather tough section for me to work through. I can only imagine what it would be like for someone who had little to no exposure on endgame. Definitely not an easy chapter at all.<br />
Overall, I would divide the book into the following categories: 10% Opening Principles, 40% Handicap Go, 30% Tesuji, and 20% Endgame. And as such, I find that it is not quite aptly named as &#8220;Basic Techniques of Go&#8221; since there was far more handicap go than I think is appropriate for beginners. And not to mention, what about life and death? That deserves attention in here as well if it is going to be titled &#8220;Basic Techniques of Go.&#8221;<br />
In regards to its overall difficulty, it really does feel as if the reader needs to already have a decent grasp of the material in order to truly understand and digest the contents of this book. To be clear though, I am by no means saying that the content in this book is bad. Quite the contrary in fact, there is a lot of information considering how short the book is. It&#8217;s just that its rather dense for beginner/intermediate players.<br />
So if you fall into the category of beginner/intermediate players looking to get stronger, I do not recommend this book for you. Instead, I recommend checking out the Mastering the Basics series from Kiseido as a better alternative.<br />
[/expand]
[expand title=&#8221;Synopsis&#8221; trigclass=&#8221;expandTitle&#8221;]
<strong>What did I enjoy about the book?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>There is a lot of information on handicap go.</li>
<li>They did do a pretty nice job surveying some common tesuji.</li>
<li>There were problems to accompany the tesuji and endgame section.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What did I gain from reading this book?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Due to the dense material, I can&#8217;t say I really gained anything from this first reading.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What aspect(s) can be improved on?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>In all honesty, I don&#8217;t feel that it would be very fair for me to criticize the book at the moment since I feel that its content is generally out of reach for me. The one thing I will say is that the title is a little misleading to the unsuspecting player. Otherwise, I will save my comments for when I am able to better comprehend the book.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Is this book easy to read?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>As a mid to high single digit kyu, I felt that it was rather difficult to read due to the level of discussion that occurred in the book. However, if one could easily follow the level of content in this book, the English is rather straightforward and should be pretty easy to work through.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Bottom Line</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Content is essentially 10% opening principles, 40% handicap go, 30% tesuji, and 20% endgame.</li>
<li>Better suited to players already familiar with the content in the book. In other words, NOT for beginners.</li>
<li>If you&#8217;re a beginner/intermediate player looking to get stronger, check out the Mastering Basics series instead.</li>
</ol>

<strong>My Abilities</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>While I have done some studying on handicap go, my knowledge is primarily a compilation of advice from other people along with my own experience as well. Overall, I would say that I believe I have a basic understanding of how handicap games should be played.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>My Perspective</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Though I&#8217;ve read tidbits on handicap go here and there, I am hoping that this book will be the first that tries to break down handicap go into into simplest components in order to provide guidance to players new to handicap go.</li>
</ul>
[/expand]
[expand title=&#8221;My Review&#8221; trigclass=&#8221;expandTitle&#8221; expanded=&#8221;true&#8221;]
<strong>What did I enjoy about the book?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The advice for Black is broken down into 20 strategic principles.</li>
<li>There is a chapter devoted to advising how one should play with White.</li>
<li>There are example games that range from professionals level to amateur dan level.</li>
<li>There are practice problems to help reinforce the concepts the reader just learned.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What did I gain from reading this book?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A better understanding of how to play as Black in handicap games.</li>
<li>Realization that as White it is not actually beneficial to make overplays consistently, but rather to play solid moves with strategic value and to take advantage of Black&#8217;s inefficient moves and/or strategic plans.</li>
<li>A new perspective on how handicap games actually should go all the way into the endgame for the handicap to be considered fair in relation to the ranks.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What style of teaching does the book use?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Textbook Approach
<ul>
<li>Explanations can be very dense at times and it uses problems or examples to try and illustrate its message. This is not a negative thing though, since it allows for re-readability in the future.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Primary Learning Mechanism:
<ul>
<li>Explanations.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Other Learning Mechanisms:
<ul>
<li>Practice problems.</li>
<li>Examples from professional and amateur level games.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What aspect can be improved on?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>In the future, I think it would be nice to see strategic principles organized for White the way it is designed for Black. Not sure how possible this really is, but it&#8217;d be neat if it were possible.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Is this book easy to read?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Yes. Though some explanations may be advanced at times, Bozulich strikes a great balance between introductory explanations and advanced concepts. It makes for a solid book that will be worth re-reading in the future.</li>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Overall Rating: 8 / 10 Ponnuki</h2>
<h3>Basic Information</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Title:</strong> Kage&#8217;s Secret Chronicles of Handicap Go</li>
<li><strong>Author: </strong>Toshiro Kageyama, 6-dan (translated by James Davies)</li>
<li><strong>Publisher: </strong>The Ishi Press, Inc.</li>
<li><strong>Publication Date: </strong>October 1975</li>
<li><strong>Page Length:</strong> 204 pages</li>
</ul>
<h3>Synopsis</h3>
<ul>
<li>An entertaining book from Kageyama that illustrates handicap go concepts through a conversational style of writing.</li>
<li>Does not explain handicap go from a traditional textbook like style.</li>
<li>Appropriate for 5 kyu and stronger.</li>
<li>Recommended for serious players who already have a foundation on handicap go.</li>
</ul>
<p><span id="more-2784"></span></p>
<h3>What I Expected</h3>
<ul>
<li><span style="line-height: 13px;">A format similar to <a title="Book Review: Lessons in the Fundamentals of Go" href="//book-review-lessons-in-the-fundamentals-of-go/">Lessons in the Fundamentals of Go</a> except for handicap go.</span></li>
<li>To gain a better understanding of how handicap go should be played from both White and Black&#8217;s perspective.</li>
<li>A thorough explanation of different concepts in handicap go.</li>
</ul>
<h3>What You Can Expect</h3>
<ul>
<li>The format of the book consists more of Kageyama&#8217;s conversations during handicap games and some of his thoughts on the position at hand.</li>
<li>Tidbits of wisdom and advice are hidden among the conversation, but it is not as apparent as one would see from a textbook style book.</li>
<li>Multiple choice questions about where the reader thinks the player in question should play next along with explanations as to why each answer is wrong or right.</li>
</ul>
<h3>My Thoughts as a 5 Kyu</h3>
<p>Although this book was not quite what I expected, this book has two shining qualities:</p>
<ol>
<li><span style="line-height: 13px;">Kageyama&#8217;s entertaining writing and thoughts.</span></li>
<li>The multiple choice questions embedded throughout the games.</li>
</ol>
<p>To no one&#8217;s surprise, Kageyama&#8217;s writing continues to entertain and provide a very easy read for just about anyone who understands go terminology. The only unfortunate aspect is that the book is not structured in a topic format similar to <a title="Book Review: Lessons in the Fundamentals of Go" href="//book-review-lessons-in-the-fundamentals-of-go/">Lessons in the Fundamentals of Go</a>. If it was, this book would probably be another the holy grail of handicap go information.<br />
For the multiple choice questions, even though some might view the questions as a sort of tsumego, the questions felt a lot more like a teacher asking the student where he/she would play and then explaining why each option is better or worse than the others. And to be honest, now that I&#8217;ve been exposed to this style of question, I wish that other tsumego books would follow a similar format since it makes each learning point much more organic and easier to understand.<br />
Finally, since this book is rather difficult to find, I would advise that you not spend a lot of money trying to obtain it unless you are a collector of some sorts. It&#8217;s a great book to have in your collection, but the content is not so earth shattering that you absolutely need to have this book in order to further your understanding of handicap go.<br />
<em>Note: As some of you might have noticed, the appropriate rank is higher than normal. The reason for this is because the conversation writing style yields a rather high level and abstract discussion of the game that most beginner players would probably find bewildering. And since the last thing I want is for you to spend your limited time on something you&#8217;ll find difficult to understand, I chose to recommend it at a higher rank then normal.</em></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>In case it wasn&#8217;t apparent to everyone, this week has been entirely centered around boxing analogies along with handicap go. There hasn&#8217;t been as many ranked games as I might have liked, but the amount of go I&#8217;ve been playing/studying seems to be harmonizing much better with the rest of my life. Still fine tuning a number of things, but just glad to not feel overwhelemed by go anymore.</p>
<h2>Games</h2>
<ul>
<li><span style="line-height: 13px;">KGS &#8211; 2 games (2 wins : 0 losses)</span></li>
<li>DGS &#8211; 2 ongoing games</li>
<li>Nova &#8211; 3 ongoing games</li>
</ul>
<h2>Training</h2>
<ul>
<li><span style="line-height: 13px;">20 tsumego problems each day.</span></li>
<li>Worked <em>Mastering the Basics: The Basics of Go Strategy</em>.</li>
<li>Started reading <em>Kage&#8217;s Secret Chronicles of Handicap Go.</em></li>
</ul>
<h2>Lessons Learned</h2>
<ol>
<li>When attacking, strike at the vital points while maintaining strength and not overextending yourself.</li>
<li>It&#8217;s okay to let things live or give your opponents points, as long as you are getting more in return.</li>
<li>Don&#8217;t over think your moves in turn based go. Rather than spend hours staring at the screen trying to make the perfect move, you will learn and gain more by playing more games and learning from your mistakes.</li>
</ol>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As I dive further into handicap games, I&#8217;m beginning to gain an appreciation for them. Instead of being something I used to detest and feel powerless to play against, I see each game (regardless of whether I&#8217;m Black or White) as an opportunity to prove that I can elevate my game another notch.<br />
When playing as Black, my goal is to maintain a proactive role while keeping an eye on the connections between my groups while ensuring that my attacks are generating profit at the same time. I do not let overplays scare me into spreading myself out to thin which only serves to White&#8217;s advantage. In addition, I always try to remember that I don&#8217;t need to kill White in order to win. I am already ahead, as long as the territory I gain is more than White is getting, my victory will be assured.<br />
On the opposite end of the spectrum, when I&#8217;m white, my goal is is to aim for any weaknesses in my opponent&#8217;s strategy and position and exploit them while trying to catch up one point at a time. Contrary to my prior approach to playing white in handicap games, the goal is <em><strong>not</strong></em> to make numerous overplays in hopes of the opponents making some tragic mistake.<br />
In addition, one of the hardest things I have found about playing White in handicap games is that the feeling of being behind can become very difficult to handle at certain points in the game. In fact, I feel like for most of the first half of the game, it&#8217;s pretty much an uphill battle the entire time. The crucial point in victory often comes when there are more stones on the board and you can utilize your reading and planning abilities to finally turn the tide.<br />
Anyhow, those are my findings for now. Looking forward to see what else awaits me in the depths of handicap go!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Over the last couple months, one of the things I&#8217;ve been really wrestling with is my aversion to handicap games: regardless of which side I was on. I can&#8217;t really pinpoint the reason for this fear of playing handicap games, but it was leading me down a path where I was starting to avoid playing handicap games all together.<br />
There&#8217;s a quote that my brother has on his phone: &#8220;Life begins where your comfort zone ends.&#8221; Although I was not thinking of go when he first showed it to me, it recently dawned upon me that &#8220;getting stronger in go begins where your comfort zone ends.&#8221;<br />
<figure id="attachment_2726" style="width: 300px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2013/05/gru_lightbulb.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-2726" alt="Credit to DespicableMeForum" src="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2013/05/gru_lightbulb.png?resize=300%2C169" width="300" height="169" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Credit to <a href="http://www.despicablemeforum.proboards.com/index.cgi?board=movie&amp;action=display&amp;thread=391">DespicableMeForum</a></figcaption></figure>
At that moment, any negative emotions I had about handicap go was instead replaced by excitement for the possibilities that lay beyond the world of handicap go. It&#8217;s not such much that I want to become an expert in handicap go, but there is so much to be learned through playing it that it could mean wonders for my growth. Oh the possibilities&#8230;</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">Both players: 3-0, and I was facing my worst nightmare: <strong>another</strong> 4 stone handicap game.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">In terms of competitive play, this is probably the most intense of all scenarios. Both you and your opponent are aware that only one will emerge victorious, so there is a huge pressure to fight with everything you have till the very end because neither will yield in this kind of game. And as someone who has never been in this situation before, it was an overwhelming feeling that made me shake with anticipation.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">As the game was coming to a close, we had a pretty big crowd watching the game. And let me tell you, the only thing that could make losing a crucial game like this even worse would be to do so in front of a crowd of people.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">When we finished counting the score, I couldn&#8217;t believe my ears when I heard: &#8220;Black has 59 points. White has 88.5 points.&#8221;</p>

<p>In all my naivety, it never occurred to me that I might end up giving my opponent handicap stones. After all, the majority of the time spent playing online were either even games or against stronger opponents who would give me handicap stones, not the other way around!! To make matters worse, I had spent so much time studying how Black should deal with handicap games that I wasn&#8217;t quite sure what to do as White. And as if that wasn&#8217;t enough, my familiarity with handicap games extended as far as 3 stones. Now that I was facing an opponent with 4 stones, I couldn&#8217;t help but feel the blood begin to drain from my face as I stared down the menacing board.<br />
&#8220;All four corners are gone&#8230; I don&#8217;t even have one corner of influence to work with&#8230; I have no idea what I&#8217;m going to do&#8230;&#8221;<br />
<span id="more-936"></span><br />
As my mind began to race, I tried to calm down as I tried to reverse engineer White&#8217;s strategy in handicap games:</p>
<ol>
<li>White must play aggressively to negate Black&#8217;s advantage.</li>
<li>White must therefore deviate from standard tactics.</li>
<li>White must do the best job possible to confuse Black and complicate matters as much as possible.</li>
</ol>
<p>Okay. I had my strategy now. Rely on my reading abilities to help me kill something and I&#8217;ll be able to catch up&#8230; (<em>Boy would this get me into trouble&#8230;)</em><br />
After the customary exchange of &#8220;Have a good game,&#8221; I took a deep breath and reached for my first stone.<br />
First move: <a title="Keima Kakari" href="http://senseis.xmp.net/?KeimaKakari">keima kakari</a> on the upper right star.<br />

<div id='glift_display2' style='height:500px; width:100%; position:relative;'></div>

<p>As we counted the points, I couldn&#8217;t help but think about the numerous times I was supposed to die. My opponent, Anderson, had played very well. In fact, he came very close to demolishing me that game. I had overestimated my abilities and underestimated his ability to play great moves and avoid a critical loss. If it had not been for the connection (Move 171), I don&#8217;t think I could have won that game. My spirit was already polluted with so much shame at that point that I would have resigned had he cut off the groups properly.<br />
As we moved into the final stages of the game, I noticed that there was a man who was staring intently at our game. When I realized this, I felt an urge to cover the board in order to hide the shameful game that I had played; but we all know that such a thought is silly, so I did my best to focus on the remainder of the game. When the game was over, Anderson was kind enough to offer to eat lunch with me since we were one of the last to finish and I was alone, but I had some calls to make so I had to decline.<br />
I sat outside eating some rice and fries from a local Peruvian restaurant (<a title="El Pollo Rico Yelp" href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/el-pollo-rico-arlington">El Pollo Rico</a>) and stared aimlessly into the distance as I recalled the game I had just played: the miserable moves, the miraculous connection, and the empty victory. I was exhausted, and thoughts about calling it quits even crossed my mind.<br />
Somewhere amidst my pity party, I saw Anderson sitting down to eat lunch with the very man I saw intently watching our game.<br />
&#8220;That must be the guy he was telling me about that helps to review his games,&#8221; I thought, &#8220;No doubt they are probably talking about the game that we just played.&#8221;<br />
I felt a bit of envy as I wished that my buddy Nate was with me, just like the time at the New Jersey Open. I knew that if anyone could help knock me to my senses, he could do it. Alas, I knew that it was only wishful thinking. As I sat there, seriously considering the idea of going home for the day, I was reminded of the tagline that I used in my blog at one point, &#8220;Embark on an impossible journey with me as I attempt to become a professional go player before age 30.&#8221;<br />
I smiled as I realized how stupid I was being. Was this all I was capable of? After all, what kind of pro wins the first two rounds and calls it quits because the last game was not a game that he/she was necessarily proud of? In fact, even if I had lost the first two matches, I want to be the kind of player that who has the strength to overcome his failures and weaknesses and continue to play the best game possible till the very end.<br />
With a renewed confidence, I made my way back to the tournament room and looked at the pairing list for the third round &#8211; Ben [8k] vs. Black [9k].<br />
My first even game with +0.50 komi. A chance to prove that the first two games were not a fluke&#8230;</p>

<p>My opponent made his first move: upper left star.<br />
I stared at the board as I recalled memories of playing with my friend Nate: the various approaches I tried before, the numerous times he gave me advice as to how he tries to play as white, and how I should try to play as black. I wasn&#8217;t sure what was in store for me, because this was not going to be a fun casual Monday night game. This was a game that neither of us wanted to lose. After all, I&#8217;m sure that neither of us wanted to start the tournament off with a loss. Nonetheless, only one of us would come out a victor&#8230;<br />

<p>As we were cleaning up the stones, I felt dazed as I was still in disbelief that I had managed to pull of a win, and a narrow one at that. Before I could even really collect my thoughts together however, I heard that the next pairings had been posted. I walked over and scanned the list &#8211; Ben [8k] vs. Black [12k]. At first I was relieved since I wouldn&#8217;t be playing an SDK, but then it hit me: <em><strong>I have to give him 4 stones</strong></em>.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Update: Upon analysis as a 7k, my 14k self was very wrong about my mistake. The position is seki either way. So there was nothing to be so sad about. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></em></p>
