<h2 style="text-align: center;">Happy Halloween!!!</h2>
<p>So over the last week or so, there has been quite a bit development in regards to exciting things like <a title="New and Affordable Go Equipment!!!" href="//new-affordable-go-equipment/">GoGameGuru releasing new affordable go equipment</a> along with a bit of realization on my part on how to continue improving the blog. Out of all that thinking and such, I am happy to announce the following:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Weekly Go Wednesdays (WGW) is coming back!</strong> &#8211; Although I love just rambling on about my thoughts and emotions, I&#8217;m sure that it would be appreciated if there were more go-related advice on this blog. As a result, I decided to bring back WGW. However, in order to prevent the series from going on hiatus again, I&#8217;m changing up the format to reflect an informal advice column as opposed to a structured and well edited articles (that are incredibly time consuming to produce). I&#8217;m hoping that you all will find this series to be a welcome addition back into the blog.</li>
<li><strong>Equipment Review Updates and Redesign!</strong> &#8211; I had talked about this a few times in the past, but it&#8217;s really happening this time around since I have purchased a ton of new products from GoGameGuru and want the review layout to be more useful. So be on the lookout for new reviews along with a new layout!</li>
</ol>
<p>Hope you all have an awesome and fun Halloween!</p>
