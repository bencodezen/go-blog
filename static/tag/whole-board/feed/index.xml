<h2 style="text-align: center;">Get Strong at Joseki 2</h2>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> In the third volume of the Get Strong at Go Series, Bozulich familiarizes the reader with 8 josekis that commonly occur around the 5-4 and 5-3 point, how to handle them in regards to their variations, choosing the correct joseki given the whole board, and how to play after the joseki is completed. A great book for players who want a better grasp on joseki as a whole.<br />

<strong>My Abilities</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>I have had some exposure to joseki, but for the most part I have avoided the study of joseki for a long time. As a result, I would consider my knowledge and ability to use joseki to be very weak, ESPECIALLY when it comes to the 5-4 and 5-3 points.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>My Perspective</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>After reading <a title="Book Review: Get Strong at Joseki 1" href="//book-review-get-strong-at-joseki-1/">Get Strong at Joseki 1</a>, I was looking forward to what this book had to offer. And to be clear, I was hoping to get more exposure to more joseki and continue familiarizing myself with it.</li>
</ul>
[/expand]
[expand title=&#8221;Synopsis&#8221; trigclass=&#8221;expandTitle&#8221;]
<strong>What did I enjoy about the book?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>I enjoy the fact that Bozulich includes some common trick plays and how to handle them.</li>
<li>The problems contain variations on different scenarios that really help acclimate the reader to seeing how just one slight chance in the sequence can completely change the outcome.</li>
<li>There is a whole section devoted to choosing joseki in regards to the entire board.</li>
<li>Proper attention is given to how to play once a joseki is finished.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What did I gain from reading this book?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>An increased liking and familiarity with joseki.</li>
<li>A better understanding of how to apply or even deviate from joseki in my own games.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What is the format of the book?</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Similar to the Get Strong at Joseki 1, there is an introduction section that familiarizes the reader with the featured joseki in the book. Afterwards, the rest are practice problems accompanied by their solutions to help the reader gain a better grasp on the joseki.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>What aspects can be improved on?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>No complaints here!</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Is this book easy to read?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Yes and no. The explanations are short and concise for those who are familiar with much of go strategy and its terminology. For those who might be unfamiliar with things such as a &#8220;severe pincer&#8221; or how moves are &#8220;pressuring another group&#8221; might find it a little hard to comprehend.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Bottom Line</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Excellent format for players to familiarize themselves with joseki.</li>
<li>Gives great practice for trying to see the board as a whole instead of localized sequences.</li>
<li>A fantastic way for players to gain a better handle on using joseki instead of simply memorizing them.</li>
</ol>

[expand title=&#8221;My Review&#8221; trigclass=&#8221;expandTitle&#8221; expanded=&#8221;true&#8221;]
Overall, I was very happy with the continued quality of problems in this book. Similar to the previous volume, I found that the first section regarding joseki variations was rather hard for me to work through. Though to be clear, Bozulich acknowledges that this will be common for many players at first due to unfamiliarity with the material. So it&#8217;s nothing to fret about.<br />
The favorite part of my book continues to be the section on &#8220;Choosing the Right Joseki and Playing the Right Joseki&#8221; since it is geared toward getting to the reader to take into account the whole board when making their decision. This is a wonderful change of scenery from the narrow perspective that players often practice on (such as focusing on just a corner or two groups for life and death). So much love for this section. Definitely hoping to see more of this in the next volume!<br />

[expand title=&#8221;My Review&#8221; trigclass=&#8221;expandTitle&#8221; expanded=&#8221;true&#8221;]
Overall, I was very impressed with this book. While the first section of the book regarding joseki variations was a bit difficult for me to work through (since my own knowledge of joseki is very weak), the other two sections were very helpful and enjoyable to practice since I was able to be exposed to a lot of new ideas and practice my whole board evaluation ability. As mentioned above in the &#8220;Before I Read This Book&#8221; section, I am someone who has always been adverse to joseki and have thus avoided the topic as a whole. So the fact that I did not find this book excruciating to work through speaks quite a bit about it.<br />

<strong>My Abilities</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Although I&#8217;ve had some exposure to joseki, I have avoided studying them like the plague. I really, really don&#8217;t like studying joseki.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>My Perspective</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>After reading the first volume, I was excited to get started on this volume to continue seeing how good my whole board thinking was.</li>
</ul>

[expand title=&#8221;My Review&#8221; trigclass=&#8221;expandTitle&#8221; expanded=&#8221;true&#8221;]
<strong>What did I enjoy about the book?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Really simple and easy to understand explanations for positions that were once foreign to me.</li>
<li>Does a great job keeping the opening to a realistic scenario that you might actually see in your own game.</li>
<li>Shows the reader that there can be more than one right answer in a position.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What did I gain from reading this book?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Improved understanding of how certain moves work with the board as a whole.</li>
<li>Reduction in kyu tunnel vision since I have more practice considering the whole board position.</li>
<li>Slightly better understanding of joseki patterns for the 3-4 point, high and far kakari. Though in all honesty, I&#8217;ve already forgotten most of it already. Haha.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What style of teaching does the book use?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Off the Cliff Style
<ul>
<li>There is no gradual progression into the material.</li>
<li>You learn through trial and error as you progress through the book.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Primary Learning Mechanism:
<ul>
<li>Multiple choice practice problems.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Other Learning Mechanisms:
<ul>
<li>Clear and concise explanations with an accompanying diagram to illustrate his point.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What aspect can be improved on?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>They need to come out with another volume on star point joseki! That would be awesome!</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Is this book easy to read?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Absolutely. The explanations are no longer than a paragraph long and are very clear and concise.</li>

<a title="Book Review: 38 Basic Joseki" href="//book-review-38-basic-joseki/">38 Basic Joseki</a>, like most joseki books, actually focuses on teaching the reader about the various sequences from joseki. There is some mention of how they affect the board as a whole, but there is a lack of illustration as to how it is truly impacted. Whole Board Thinking in Joseki, on the other hand, does a perfect job filling this gap.<br />
