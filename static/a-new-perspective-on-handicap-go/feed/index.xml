		<description><![CDATA[I remember something another go player on Sensei&#039;s Library once said about handicap go now that you mention this.  It was something along the lines of when you&#039;re white in a handicap game, your game needs to go above and beyond what it normally is to win the game (assuming no conscious overplays), and as black you need to stay quite calm and focused to maintain your lead throughout the game.  Your brother&#039;s quote on comfort zone reminded me of what this player said, and, like with your and Eyecather, reminded me that I should play more handicap go as well.  Thanks for the post =).]]></description>
