		<description><![CDATA[I tried using Yoo&#039;s Life and Death a little back then, but it was really buggy and I couldn&#039;t get it to work consistently and eventually gave up on it. It looked like it had promise though. Maybe I&#039;ll try on my iPhone again.
In regards to the other app &quot;tsumego,&quot; that sounds terrifying. I already think that the problem sets overall could use some quality assurance so having to play both sides sounds too intense for me. I mean I&#039;m sure it&#039;s great for studying, but I just don&#039;t have that kind of time.
I&#039;ll have to check out the &quot;go joseki.&quot; Thanks for the advice! Let me know if you ever find anything else!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[If you&#039;re interested in other tsumego apps, I can recommend (for Android, at least) Yoo&#039;s Life and Death and WBaduk (which has a big go problem set in addition to being a  client).  Both apps have their own bugs and issues.  WBaduk has more.  But they&#039;re both usable.
That&#039;s as opposed to an app just called &quot;tsumego&quot; which has a flaw so huge I can&#039;t imagine anyone ever using it (namely: you have to play the other side&#039;s moves as well, and correctly guess which doomed attempt at refutation the problem has in mind).  However, there&#039;s also a really cool and smooth joseki dictionary called simply &quot;go joseki&quot; by the same guy who made the unusable &quot;tsumego&quot;.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[For sake of portability and accessibility, I am a big advocate of doing problems on your phone. Especially if it&#039;s something like creating a habit, and the app I use it MagicBaduk. It has some quirks in its design and functionality, but i think it has very solid problem sets that every player needs to eventually know. Definitely worth the money.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Great question! I actually go for very simple problems that take me anywhere from 5 to 30 seconds to solve. My goal with problem solving this way is creating a disciplined habit where my reading becomes instinctual. An example would be when you see a bent in three shape and know immediately that it&#039;s dead. Does that make sense?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Out of curiosity what difficulty problems do you tend to go for? 300 problems in approx. 30 mins seems like quite a lot to me, but maybe thats because the problems I tend to do take me about a minute to solve. Maybe I should focus on doing more simpler ones.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[An excellent question. To be honest, the resolution kind of fizzled out when I stopped playing consistently. As you predicted, it ended up falling to the wayside as my focus kept returning to things like direction of play, life and death, etc.
To be honest, I&#039;ve tried to resolve to count more often, but I have to admit that I always find myself so low on time with my regular playing style that I never get around to doing it during a game. Perhaps I will need to change my approach to improving this aspect of my game through other means first before trying to implement into live games... Definitely food for thought. Thanks for reminding me!]]></description>
