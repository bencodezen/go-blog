		<description><![CDATA[Actually it&#039;s not so much not that I don&#039;t want to play against the Chinese. In fact, with the White formation in this game, if White is allows to enclose the lower left corner against the Chinese, it&#039;s actually very good in terms of countering the Chinese straetgy. So in actuality, it&#039;s Black who chose to complicate things by approaching and not forming the Chinese.
So when you consider &quot;violating principles of the opening,&quot; you have to remember that this particular case is done with the entire board in mind. Because essentially, it&#039;s a counter fuseki strategy that has been studied and researched by pros for this specific board position.
And the reason you generally want to avoid approaching immediately as White is that it gives Black the opportunity to determine the flow of the game.
Does any of this make any sense? I fear I may have rambled too much. Haha.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I suppose it makes sense if you just want to not play against the Chinese or mini Chinese, but aside from preference there seems to be little reason to need to avoid these fuseki. Professional players constantly play as white against these Chinese openings, and they would go through a lot just to disrupt it if they felt it were bad for white.
Violating an important principle of the opening for that reason seems wrong to me. However, we are not exactly pros, and if you can justify the opening through your own skill on the board you are more than fine. Its really just a small complaint from me I guess.
One question I would have is, if you want to disrupt the Chinese opening, why not approach the lower right stone instead of putting a stone on the 3-4 in the lower left?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hahaha. So yes, initially I was completely horrified at the idea of exposing my weak side to the opponent, but then frozensoul explained to me that it&#039;s okay as long as you are intending to get approached and start a fighting game. xD So hope that helps to clear up my intentions a bit. =)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Ah this was a good game. Although i cant help but think that your 3-4 stone is facing the wrong direction. It seems worse to me than allowing a mini-chinese off the 4-4. All of my opening understanding screams EW at it. :)]]></description>
