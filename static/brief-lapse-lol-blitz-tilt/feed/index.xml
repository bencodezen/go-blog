		<description><![CDATA[Haha it seems so. I apologize for the delay in my response to your comment, but it struck me and I wanted to take my time with it. And I can definitely say that League of Legends is definitely a different audience than I&#039;m typically used to from the go community. xD Definitely way more trolling teens and trash talking than I&#039;d care to see.
In regards to blitz go, I would have to say that overall, I would agree that it certainly is better to simply play blitz go than to spend the time on something frivolous. However, I would say that the tricky part is not letting the bad habits become part of one&#039;s serious go. Does that make sense? =) But then again, I am not one to talk when it comes to that. Haha. After all, my impulsivity gets me in trouble time and time again. XD]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[What&#039;s the story behind all the blitz go that the dans on KGS play? It&#039;s one thing that tempts me to say that blitz just can&#039;t be all that bad. I&#039;ve reluctantly accepted blitz go as part of my life - I just don&#039;t make enough time for full, thoughtful games, and the stupid-quick blitz games I play on a different account are, I suspect, an important part of the reason I&#039;ve kept improving (albeit slowly).
There&#039;s no question in my mind that if I spent the same amount of time playing serious games I would benefit more from the time. But that isn&#039;t the issue: blitz go lets me play go with energy that would otherwise go to something purely frivolous.
I also have diverted energy for the past month (or maybe almost two) into another game: I was hooked for a while on a MUD I used to play in the &#039;90s, and started getting ridiculously serious about it. It was thrilling to jump into something completely unknown and walk the path of growing understanding and strength. It was really fun, but I knew in the back of my mind that it had no rewards outside of itself. The player base was kind of obnoxious (I read more sexist, crude, and even racist comments in two months there than I&#039;ve heard in years) and no one would ever care about skills I developed there outside of a tiny audience. Compare that to go, where the community is so large, and the skills so timelessly relevant.
Luckily, a minor calamity occurred (I went on a disastrous run where the whole group was annihilated and we all lost our gear) that let me snap out of it and quit the game. Go&#039;s not as easy to pour time into - because it&#039;s harder, it can sometimes have the feeling of work - but its rewards are so much deeper.
Anyway - just an anecdote. As always, we walk similar paths.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I think if you had a really well disciplined mind you could use blitz to learn more about and get better at longer games. The problem is that it develops bad habits that are hard to break.
Although, I have to say, blitz go is just as much go as any other type. However, if your goal is to get good at either blitz or long time controlled games it is probably best to stick to one or the other.
We need to play another game some time. If you have time. A tie breaker. :D]]></description>
