		<description><![CDATA[That sounds great! I look forward to our games!
Ah, but the beauty of online play is your ability to choose your time settings! Just make sure you don&#039;t accept anything lower than whatever time limit you desire. (It sounds like you could use at least 20 min main time if not 30 min).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Perhaps we can help one another get over it some. I&#039;ll play you later on KGS if you like. You&#039;ll almost certainly beat me, but no worries. I play to learn.
BTW, one of the main things that bothers me about online play is that I don&#039;t really like fast games. I don&#039;t feel that I learn from them. They just reinforce bad habits. So, if you do decide to play me, be warned that I&#039;m no blitz player. ;-)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[You are most certainly not alone gekkoe. It&#039;s almost like I get a mini-anxiety attack when thinking about playing online; but it is something that we should realize that we are doing to ourselves. Haha. Just one step at a time, hopefully we won&#039;t have this problem in the future!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks for talking about your &quot;reservations about playing games&quot;. I have a bit of this as well. It&#039;s easy enough in person with a real board, or against my computer, but I still find stuff like KGS a little intimidating.
Something to get over eh?
Nice to hear I&#039;m not alone...]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Yep. I think they&#039;re great too. Inspired me to do the same with some of my own games. Seems a useful practice! :)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The decision to start commenting on every move came from my own reading of other blogs and commentaries and felt one too many times that I couldn&#039;t understand how the player got from point A to point B. After a while though, I realized that this was also a good exercise for myself as well. So to answer your question, it&#039;s both!]]></description>
