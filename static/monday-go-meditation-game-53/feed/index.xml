		<description><![CDATA[Haha. I would like to think so too! It&#039;s always funny how games inevitably circle back to Kageyama&#039;s emphasis on the fundamentals of being able to read out a ladder. And the great thing about it is that I don&#039;t think it&#039;ll ever get old. =D]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The cut at 25 is really a thank-you move, from white&#039;s perspective. After all, you deliberately left that defect in your shape in order to play light. When you do that, you&#039;re trying to tempt your opponent into going after part of your shape in order to get shape and strength in exchange. So the last thing black wants to do is offer you something of value in exchange for that defect: he wants it to stay with you, to become YOUR problem. Even a move like S16 is better for black - take the big corner, as you suggest, and let white&#039;s two stones with a cutting point hang out together, trying to figure out what to do. Want to connect? Now black gets to attack a much heavier shape. Don&#039;t want to connect? Then the cut lives on, and black can take it whenever black decides it&#039;s big enough. That&#039;s the advantage of thickness, and it&#039;s very important to resist an invader&#039;s temptation to give it up.
Thanks for posting the review - games this short aren&#039;t bad, as they offer a chance to focus on particular things. (And congrats on the win! Kageyama would be proud of the clear ladder reading.)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I never thought of 25 as a mistake, but I can see exactly what mean now. Perhaps it is best to simply keep White weak and secure the corner while harassing it to secure a nice outside position for later on.
Thanks for your insight man. Always appreciate it!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[White does a good job neutralizing the value of two thick black positions in this game - hard not to feel some sympathy for black, here. Black&#039;s big opening mistake, IMO, is cutting at 25. It represents full cooperation with white&#039;s plans and creates fighting that immediately begins to erode black&#039;s thickness up top and on the bottom. You&#039;re correct that the connection at A doesn&#039;t work, so it&#039;s time for black to look at the top, at P14 or O13 or something similar. It&#039;s overplay to try to deny white anything on the right... what black should want is for white to make a bunch of disadvantageous exchanges as he tries to survive on the right.]]></description>
