		<description><![CDATA[Nice review, see a similar, but (just) a tiny bit more negative... although my opinion is not totally negative... i did enjoy the movie... but i near the end show-Down i thought that all was a bit too fast and simple... story lacks a bit of depth and while some scenes are rich of flavour (the open gambling room ... some outside scenes) many indoor scenes felt a bit dry... for example the short &quot;love story&quot; scene... i think the movie could have needed a bit more extra money... but yes, i would see it again, although i expected a bit more :)))]]></description>
