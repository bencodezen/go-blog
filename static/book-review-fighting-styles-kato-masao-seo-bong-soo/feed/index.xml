		<description><![CDATA[I think the reason for the price hike on the printed version is that you are paying for analysis on two different players instead of just the one, but I also bought the Smartgo version and thought it was well worth the money as well.
And I&#039;m with you on feeling &quot;3 stones stronger&quot; after reading his books but then it magically disappearing when I&#039;m actually playing a game. xD]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I read &quot;Master Play, The Style of Lee Chango&quot; from Yuan Zhou. Yuan Zhou really has a way of making you understand the position without giving too much variations. Every time I read something from him I feel 3 stones stronger (I never was, but still: good feeling!)
I would say the Smartgo price is reasonable, but I wouldn&#039;t pay 17.50 for a book version.]]></description>
