		<description><![CDATA[What an incredibly insightful (and appropriate) quote! As time has gone on, more and more it seems like I may actually be frustrated with my strategic abilities more so than my fighting abilities. I will definitely need to look into Mitch Bradley&#039;s book in the future. Thanks again for an awesome comment. Hopefully I can apply it to my games in the near future!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Ben, since you seemed a little bit troubled with your fighting skills recently but commented on parallels between go and boxing I found you this little thing in the late Mitch Bradleys online book &quot;Improve fast in Go&quot;. Ever considered reviewing it btw?
Fighting Guidelines: In a fencing bout, every legal touch has the same value. So when the opponent thrusts, a fencer’s first response must be to parry! Only then does it become feasible to initiate an aggressive counter action. In a boxing match, every legal blow has the same point value to the judges, but more effective blows can not only steal the initiative from the opponent but can also serve to wear him down so that both his attack and defense become less effective. Equally important, they can also serve to instantly end the bout via a knockout!
And it’s much the same in Go. A move by the opponent which intends to seize Sente by making a threat that you can’t afford to ignore may be defended against as expected, but it also may be ignored in favor of a threat of one’s own which is in fact more serious. In each case, deciding what’s appropriate strategically and then achieving their desires requires accurate positional appraisal followed by precise execution by both sides, so in the final analysis a player’s arsenal of tactical skills is the foundation upon which his strategy is both built and realized.&quot;
