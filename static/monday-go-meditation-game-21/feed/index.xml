		<description><![CDATA[While you may say it&#039;s &quot;humiliating,&quot; I must say that this sort of all or nothing battle certainly gets the heart racing. The slightest misstep even by the attacker can result in all impending doom (as witnessed in this game). Not to mention I thought you handled yourself very well. =D ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The only thing I should admit is that it WAS nice to win a game by correctly reading a double hane on the side, considering my misread of the same phenomenon caught me in my workshop game against Nathan.

		<description><![CDATA[This was a rough game. There&#039;s something so humiliating about being caught in a situation where you have to struggle to find some desperate chance to save a cut-off group. I don&#039;t enjoy it, even when I manage to save my skin. (Though, to be clear, it&#039;s a lot easier than when I DON&#039;T manage to save my skin.) I want to always have a plan.
So, to me, white comes off better in this game - your whole-board plan for building potential on the top was great, and still looks great despite the end of the game.]]></description>
