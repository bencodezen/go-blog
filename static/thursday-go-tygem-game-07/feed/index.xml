		<description><![CDATA[Yeah I don&#039;t think it&#039;s a matter of right or wrong, but definitely more about style. And let&#039;s not forget that your whole board strategy makes a big difference in why you play the moves that you do.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[usually K17 or K16 (that one make san ren sei fuseki) are ideal extension from star points like was in game. tho when u usually play a move u think bout surroundings,
K17 in game was natural, like Ben wrote on higher like like K16 would make black invasion there a bit easier.
I dont dislike this move, but prolly I like more solid/passive positions than Ben, so its matter of taste/style, not quite sure about ones true :P]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[You&#039;re welcome Robbie! When hearing comments like yours, it definitely reminds me that my time and energy is well spent on these.
To answer your question: K17 was played in order to provide flexibility at building both sides and building a top moyo as well. The reason it&#039;s on the third line is in order to provide balance to both high stones from both corners. If all the stones were high, it would be very easy for White to invade and make life.
Does that help to clarify things?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Ben, thank for posting all of your commented games. I really, really enjoy reviewing them and I look forward to receiving them so thank you so much for taking the time to do all of the hard work involved. I particularly enjoyed this game but I ended up having the same question &quot;afterbreak&quot; poses below. I too thought K17 was slow compared to your previous moves and the ones you made afterwards.  Actually K17 puzzled me even more since it seemed a bit far from the upper right corner. Please forgive me for having any opinion when I&#039;m such a poor player myself - I just concluded you were doing something I don&#039;t have the ability to comprehend properly. But nevertheless, thanks so much for posting your commented games. I learn so much from them and I am not kidding when I tell you I eagerly look forward to seeing them in my inbox.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[white R11 should be at Q12
white K17 is a bit to low, and to far from upper right corner, since ur corner still got big aji at P17 usually instead of K17 ive seen L16 move
your hane moves 48-52 was nice one, (even if those were misread I really liked it)
instead of L7 prolly should O5
just mine 2 cents here lol
overall game was nice, I liked game, tho pretty much very peaceful game from your side]]></description>
