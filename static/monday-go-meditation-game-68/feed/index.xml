		<description><![CDATA[Hey Ben,
Question: At move 52, would playing in the D10 area be a lot more beneficial before attacking the group?
Awesome review Ben! Can&#039;t wait to play you again :)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[These are just awesome, Master. I really appreciate you taking the time. Learned more from your MGM than all the Go books I have now. You&#039;ve created a unique &#039;genre&#039; of analysis, game thinking and stream-of-consciousness. They deserve to be a book, although you might not want Lee Sedol to get your secrets. ;)]]></description>
