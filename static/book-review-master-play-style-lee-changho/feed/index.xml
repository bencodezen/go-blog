		<description><![CDATA[When it comes to style of play, it&#039;s more of your general approach to the game as opposed to a rigid sequence like joseki for instance. But oftentimes, the play style you start with will have large implications on future play (which is to be expected since the opening determines what the middle game looks like).
So while you should always adapt in your games, realize that a style of play is more of a general approach to the game that carries out for most of the game. For example, most of the time, when you start playing a territorial style, you will find it near impossible to switch to moyo later on.
Does that make sense?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Great review. Is the style easy to change throughout the game in case you need to adapt to a new situation? (This question is under the presumption that you have already played with style.)]]></description>
