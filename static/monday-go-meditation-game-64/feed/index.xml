		<description><![CDATA[Haha. Well I assure you it&#039;s not the easiest venture to compete moyo v moyo as White. But if it&#039;s what you enjoy, there&#039;s a thrill in daring your opponent to see who can make the bigger moyo!
YSD as a spectator would be a great choice if you&#039;re interested and have the time to make use of the archived lectures and join in on the reviews.
Glad you enjoyed the review!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[You make it look so easy, Ben! Your affection for moyo reminds me of my own hero, Takagawa. Perhaps I join YSD as a spectator when I am done with my visualization/reading pre-learning exercises.
As always, I find the every-move and stream-of-consciousness annotations extremely helpful. Thank you!]]></description>
