		<description><![CDATA[At this point, I&#039;m not even sure it&#039;s the fact that concepts are not integrating into my game naturally. Instead, it&#039;s more like I just play moves carelessly without any  real thought as to potential consequences, which is different from instinctual play where you know the potential outcome. Does that make sense?
Your point about correspondence Go is right on the dot. I definitely haven&#039;t found a happy medium for getting in and out of the &quot;zone.&quot; Definitely something I will have to work on. Thanks for your valuable insight!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Personally, I go through a cycle like this: After lots of games, some aspect of Go clicks. Let&#039;s say it&#039;s patience with weak groups: I&#039;ve seen enough and tried enough things that I&#039;ve got a better handle than before about when settling a group is urgent, and when I can tenuki or fight with the weak group. This helps my game, and importantly, it&#039;s new and exciting so I&#039;m reading and thinking deeply in general. So I play well.
Then I get to a point where the insight has been integrated into my game. Now instead of looking at a position and thinking &quot;hmm...interesting&quot;, I think &quot;jump into the corner now!&quot; I have improved my instincts, but I&#039;m leaning on them now, which isn&#039;t nearly as good as reading and thinking with slightly worse instincts. So I spiral downwards again until a new bout of inspiration strikes.
I don&#039;t have a solution to the cycle: Approaching your games playfully can help. Trying to imagine you&#039;re 4 ranks stronger can too.
Also, correspondence Go is tricky, because you&#039;re trying to get into and out of the go &quot;zone&quot; all through the day. Playing it a lot, I find I&#039;ve developed a better sense of when a position demands deep thought, and whether I&#039;m capable of deep thought at the moment. I usually have enough games going that if when I&#039;ve got a couple free minutes I cycle through the 3 or 4 games where it&#039;s my turn and see which, if any of them, can be played somewhat instinctively. There are a lot of moves in a go game that are obviously forced, or where your instinct is so strong you&#039;re going to go with it in the end no matter how long you think. But the moves that are complicated or involve life and death are deadly if you breeze past.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[You have a good point there. I would normally take a break in times like these, but those have been occurring at a rather high frequency lately and I&#039;m hoping to get to the bottom of my issue. Haha.
Regarding your go teacher&#039;s advice on not studying professional games, you make a great point about how the subtlety of moves are often missed by even dan players, so how could kyu players have any hope? Haha.
Thanks for your encouragement! I hope to be out of my slump soon too. =D]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Whenever I have gotten into that sort of playing I have found that a break does pretty well in helping you get out of it. At least a break from playing, continuing to study games of those better than you can help you regain the inspiration to your play.
One piece of advice that I have found useful: My go teacher had always strongly recommended me to not study professional games. Instead he insisted that I study high Dan level amateurs, especially of their longer games. These players play good solid moves, but more importantly, they play good solid moves that I can hope to understand. In professional games, even a high Dan level player will often miss most of the subtlety of a lot of the game&#039;s moves, and they might have no idea why many moves were played whatsoever. What hope can we kyu players have?
Anyway, I hope you can get out of your slump. :)]]></description>
