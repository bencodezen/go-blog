		<description><![CDATA[Todd, great to hear you&#039;re enjoying the set.
We used to sell the bento bowls and stones without the board. In late October, we replaced that product with a complete set, that also includes a lightweight board. In other words, this is a slightly different product to the one you ordered earlier.
People have been asking to buy the boards individually, so (if you want one) we&#039;ll be adding them to the store, as a very cheap board, soon.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I didn&#039;t receive any sort of board with this, just a brief Baduk pamphlet in Korean which I barely glanced at before tossing out.
I keep mine in my &quot;go backpack&quot; in the box it shipped with.  It doesn&#039;t keep it so tight that there aren&#039;t stones spilled over into the wrong colour after kicking around in my backpack, but it keeps them pretty well separated.
They get tiny chips rattling around in my go backpack, but are still playable so far. I did end up with a couple shattered stones after the inevitabe knocking over of a bowl onto a coffee-shop tile floor.  Still well worth the money, though, when I&#039;m already carting a bunch of 9x9s with stones in lock n locks, a folding 19x19, and a few go books around in my backpack.]]></description>
