		<description><![CDATA[Yeah. Definitely not recommended for kyu players. If you really want to get a book on direction of play, definitely check out my review on Direction of Play from Kiseido. It&#039;s still a bit advanced, but I think it&#039;s much more in line with teaching someone direction of play than this book.
And for your second question, I realized that I didn&#039;t actually finish my thought on the second bullet, so it&#039;s updated now. Let me know if you have any other questions. =)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[So what you&#039;re saying is that we (kyu players) shouldn&#039;t read it? I still need to work on my direction of play so can you recommend any other books at the moment?]]></description>
