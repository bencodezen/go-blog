		<description><![CDATA[For me, your invasion at c17 was the crucial moment in the opening. It completely solved my potential problems on the top and put me in a position to attack, the benefits of which really lasted the whole game. An attack like g17 instead might have changed the whole game.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I agree with Moboy78 that move 33 wasn&#039;t slack. It was a strong attack, and my cut in response was probably premature.
I&#039;m pleased (I have to admit) that my kakari at R14 troubled you - it was my attempt to put Shifu&#039;s comments about its purpose into practice. But that&#039;s easier said than done. It&#039;s one thing to say that black&#039;s development is flat, but another to take advantage of it. (Note: my attempts to try out things from workshop often end disastrously.)
I have felt recently, though, that my attempt to have faith in strong positions, thickness, and whole board development have been producing results. It still comes as a surprise to me - where did that territory come from? But I feel like I&#039;m really getting away from being such a fixedly territorial player and it&#039;s helping me move forward.
That said, I had to fight my feeling about how big your right side was the whole game.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hey Ben, on move 33, when you said you thought you wasted a move attacking him, you really didn&#039;t.  When you draw a line from q10 to k11, you see that white&#039;s group doesn&#039;t quite poke out from behind that line.  If white wants his group to be secure from attack, he has get out from behind enemy lines.  If he doesn&#039;t, it becomes black&#039;s game to win.  With this in mind, your move wasn&#039;t a  &quot;non-threatening attack&quot;, but a good move instead =).]]></description>
