		<description><![CDATA[I think Cho&#039;s book is probably the most universal book I would recommend. Jasiek&#039;s book is a lot more heavy hitting and might end up being overwhelming for most people. If you&#039;re used to academic-type studying, then I think you would be able to survive Jasiek&#039;s; otherwise, it&#039;ll probably end up collecting dust due to how detailed it is. Does that make sense?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks for the review Ben.  Is it right to infer from the comment here that you might suggest starting with Cho&#039;s book and then moving on to Jasiek&#039;s?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[If you like studying things like you would a textbook, then I recommend Jasiek&#039;s book. However, if you like a more general overview that&#039;s pretty short while doing a good job covering Positional Judgment, then I would choose Cho Chikun&#039;s. Does that make sense?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hey. Seems like a great book to have, I am wanting these time to read something about positionnal judgement, I&#039;m pretty sure it could help me a lot (with more focus on reading in my games, of course, but haha, I don&#039;t expect to get at pro level right now, and I still think my &quot;brain shape (mostly, sleep) isn&#039;t at his very very best, anyway).
  My question is : what about the comparison with Cho Chikun&#039;s book, which one would you recommend more ?]]></description>
