		<description><![CDATA[Thanks for the support! It can be hard at times when I&#039;m trying to scramble for a post to do, but I think you&#039;re right in that the game commentaries are probably the one thing I should work hard to keep up this year. After some brainstorming, I think the best approach is to stockpile them instead of trying to wait to do them week by week since it allows a buffer in the event something happens.
Any personal thoughts on anything else I should keep/change to make this blog even more impressive? =)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[You&#039;ve been a phenomenally productive blogger this year, and I think all the great comments you receive are a testament to how successful you&#039;ve been. As someone who&#039;s never been able to be more than a sporadic blogger, I&#039;m impressed. Now it&#039;s time to figure out how to make it sustainable! Keep the best parts, reduce the effort on the others. For me, personally, the game commentaries are the most valuable thing you do, though I know from personal experience that those take a lot of time. The benefit, I think, is that they also help make you stronger.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[You&#039;re absolutely right. I will be sure to start adding more photos so that the posts will be more dynamic and colorful! Thanks for the suggestion! Will definitely be including that one for 2014. =D]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Sounds as though you&#039;ve sorted things out pretty well Ben. :)  Appreciated reading your summary.  Some important lessons for all of us to remember here.
One idea that came when reading the appeal for suggestions is to maybe do some photo&#039;s from the field now and again?  Often enjoy seeing the photographs folks include with their tournament write ups, or any go gathering really.  The internets needs more fun go photo&#039;s!
