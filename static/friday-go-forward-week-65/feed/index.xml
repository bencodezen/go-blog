		<description><![CDATA[Yes, Go Seigen games are about freedom and trades. That is why why studying his games You need to remember that both of those items are equal. Can say that Go is only about it. I still recall some game of master Go, that he traded his corner stone to gain upper hand in another part of board just to see few move after his stones killed half of enemy groups in game.
The most important thing I did learn from his games were:
tenuki is always good
and that tengen is important of tenuki move and/or first move as black hehe]]></description>
