		<description><![CDATA[Thanks!
I&#039;m glad to see that I&#039;m not the only one who suffers from this. It definitely can be tough to deal with, but hopefully you and I will be able to overcome it properly one day. I know that with me personally, it&#039;s the whole fear of having a bad mark on my &quot;permanent&quot; record.
Best of luck with your &quot;overthinking&quot; and hope to see you around the comments more!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Nice post and nice blog btw.
If I can reassure you about this I can tell you I suffer this at the extreme :(
I can&#039;t play a go game at all, even against a bot (only exceptions are some teaching games). But everything else is perfect in my case and not so bad. I enjoy doing tsumego, reading books and watching tons of video and games (and seeing some live self commented video of games is the top for me because that&#039;s the way I play game by procuration).
This fear of playing come insidiously step by step in my case so I think it&#039;s a good thing to be in alert with it.]]></description>
