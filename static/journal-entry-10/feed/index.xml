		<description><![CDATA[Indeed Ben. You&#039;re hardly slacking with that schedule. We can only do what we can. I&#039;m betting the hard work pays off...
Hopefully it&#039;s fun too.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I just started AYD. Loving it so far.
One of the great things about being a bit weaker player  (8-9k or so) is that progress can come so quickly with the introduction of some key ideas, and In-seong has some very good ideas, as you know. :)
I feel I&#039;ve already gained a stone or two after only 12 days. Granted, I&#039;ve watched and re-watched a lot of lessons in that time, but still, that&#039;s a great result imo.
Now to stabilize my game some. It can be rather...erratic in terms of strength.
The cost is pretty heavy, but well....I don&#039;t buy cable tv.
By the way, as you may recall, I found out about AYD from your site. Thanks for the useful tip!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I absolutely agree about the value. Alas, part of my issue is the inability to commit the proper time I would like to it in order to get the full value of it. Towards the end of the season, I barely had enough time to simply play my games and even failed to watch the review of my last game. Pretty sad huh?]]></description>
