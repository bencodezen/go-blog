		<description><![CDATA[Well in all fairness, what allowed me to find all these restaurants was withdrawing from the tournament; so I think it&#039;s totally understandable that you zeroed in on a few places. The foodie in me is too ravenous for me to not venture out into NY when I know so much good food it around me. Haha.
If I get to go, I&#039;m sure a few pictures of the college campus cafeteria food will most likely be gracing the series yet again. After all, for me, the food is a big part of travel!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[You did much better with finding good food than I did. I pretty much zeroed in on a couple of places. I should have been more adventurous. We won&#039;t have these options next year in Minneapolis. I&#039;ll look forward to your photographs of college campus cafeteria food in your Congress recap posts. :-) Maybe we will be lucky and have a congress in NYC again soon.]]></description>
