		<description><![CDATA[Thank you for the advice! I definitely don&#039;t plan on trying to copy him by any means. xD Haha. The man&#039;s reading ability was nothing short of incredible. His strategies are often planned many many moves in advanced. I have problems even planning 5 moves ahead! =D
I will definitely add 9-Dan Showdown to the list! Thank you for the recommendation!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Be careful.  One piece of pro advice I&#039;ve heard is that Go Seigen&#039;s games should be appreciated, not emulated, because if you try to play like him you will lose a lot --because you are not Go Seigen.  And that&#039;s apparently even true at the pro level.
If you want to see a lot more of such trades, read 9-dan Showdown by John Fairbairn.]]></description>
