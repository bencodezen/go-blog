		<description><![CDATA[Yeah I&#039;ve heard that as well. And while go may be popular in certain areas, it seems that Chinese chess is more commonly seen as opposed to go even though you&#039;re in Asia. Might be different in Korea though. Haha.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Unfortunately not. Go wasn&#039;t really that high of a priority on that trip, and with my nonexistent Chinese language skills it would have been very difficult to do anything related to that. It also seemed like it was not part of the culture there. I saw plenty of people playing Chinese chess, but never once a go board.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hey Todd! Long time no talk! I also stick to vegetarian food most of the time, but as you can see I just had to make an exception this trip. There were just too many opportunities I couldn&#039;t pass up! Haha. Hope you&#039;re doing well!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I am soooo hungry now.  I try to stick to vegetarian food, but I&#039;d have to be off my diet if I got a shot at some of that sashimi.  Or even some of that good looking ramen!  Or pretty much anything you took a picture of...:)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Oh nice! My Chinese teacher lives in Xi&#039;an. Haha. But that is totally what I would prefer when traveling. It&#039;s definitely great to have someone who lives in the area. Did you get to do any go related activities when you went to visit her?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I love hole in the wall type places though! Those are sometimes the best places you can go. It&#039;s just that you usually need someone to recommend it in order to know where to go, otherwise the risk of food poisoning is just way too high. Hahahaha.
It was a lot of fun! Definitely should visit sometime!]]></description>
