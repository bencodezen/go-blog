		<description><![CDATA[Certainly W14/22 is a bit special purpose, but W10 does get played in very open boards. White ends up looking pressed low under the normal joseki, all down on the third line. If you can play on the fourth line and defend the cut, why not? It also creates some height to better support a peep at your tiger mouth.
Professionals also have deeper reader and strategy when choosing a common joseki. And we make many mistakes following up on joseki moves at our level.
I guess my point is that rather than thinking a common joseki means the opponent is fine here, and an uncommon move meaning there&#039;s something to exploit here, you should try to find followups to make the move look bad either way. And also know that you might not get better than a balanced outcome either way. If that happens you didn&#039;t &#039;miss an opportunity&#039; to punish necessarily, they just played a reasonable exchange.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Well if we learn anything about professional play, it is that they usually have some deep reading or strategy behind it. I think it&#039;s important to remember that most of the times amateur players play moves like this as a mistake instead of using it for some special purpose. And so vice versa, I need to be able to take advantage of a joseki mistake when an opponent makes it. All part of building a strong foundation before venturing off into the uncharted territory of weird moves. Haha.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Sigh, I can&#039;t count ;)
I was referring to your comments/&#039;bad moves&#039;, but actually meant white 10/14/22. 10 seems &#039;almost&#039; joseki and the others are good enough to warrant occasional professional play. My comment was intended to be advise not to get to caught up in &#039;punishing&#039; joseki mistakes]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[You make excellent points. I guess it&#039;s not so much that they are &quot;wrong&quot; per say, but more along the lines of that my lines of thinking behind them was wrong. So even though they might have been played before in pro games, the rationale behind them doesn&#039;t match up so it&#039;s not a good comparison.
And also, it&#039;s not so much that I wanted to &quot;punish&quot; the joseki, but I really should have known better to take advantage of the situation because it&#039;s not as if the concepts are foreign to me. I just ignored my first instinct.
Though on the upside, it&#039;s good to know my &quot;creativity&quot; wasn&#039;t completely crazy. Haha. Thanks for researching and sharing your findings!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I knew I&#039;d seen 19 in a professional game before, and a quick search reveals it certainly gets played. 29/39 shows up as well, though rarely and essentially only when white wants to jump to O5. Neither of white&#039;s followups were joseki anyways.
19 leaves behind the weakness at E17 which you exploited, but apparently having to avoid exposing the weakness is playable.
Some moves are joseki mistakes with known refutations. But sometimes it&#039;s a less traveled path that isn&#039;t inherently inferior. Personally, I try to approach unknown moves with caution as I step off into the unknown rather than anything to punish.]]></description>

Thanks for going the extra mile ro insure everybody can easily understand plus the attached &quot;good&quot; and &quot;bad&quot; move in invaluable.  Must have taken you a solid 10-hours to perform Akkad of this very professional effort but I can tell you, &quot;The slowest ship in the convoy&quot; understands. I plan on keeping this one for many years. :)]]></description>
