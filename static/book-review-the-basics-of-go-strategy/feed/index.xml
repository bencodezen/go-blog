		<description><![CDATA[Hey! To be honest, I think the order that people read books is highly dependent on their playing style / what they are motivated to improve at the moment. As someone who likes to push the limits of my territory or frameworks, attacking and defense was the more interesting topic to me.
On the other hand though, this book does provide a great overview of basic strategy which can be useful across more of the decisions you make during a game.
Does that help?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Ben, appreciated your review of this book, was wondering would you recommend reading this before Attack and Defense? (will probably read Fundamental Principles of Go before either).  Hope things are going well off in development world and that there are chances to enjoy go now and then there.]]></description>
