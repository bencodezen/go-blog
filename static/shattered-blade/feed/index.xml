		<description><![CDATA[Hahaha. Don&#039;t worry man. It was a necessary wake up call. And perhaps you&#039;re right, my attacks probably are more analogous to a club than anything else. But no more! I will forge a blade worthy of legend! xD]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[D: I didn&#039;t mean for it to sound like that.  &quot;After all, up until this point, I always thought that I simÂ­ply had misÂ­guided attacks that were strong while lackÂ­ing in preÂ­cise and accuÂ­rate moveÂ­ments. In realÂ­ity though, I may have been entirely delusional.&quot;  I have to disagree with you here.  I guess I wasn&#039;t as specific as I should have been earlier, but what I meant was that you attacked with a club, not a sword.  Sure, you attacked when and what you needed to, but what I had meant was that your attacks didn&#039;t strike the vital points.  For instance, in our last game, when I tried to live on the right side in your moyo, I felt like I was being herded by a shepherd dog rather than being attacked by wolves.  At least in my eyes, it&#039;s not as bad as you say.  =)]]></description>
