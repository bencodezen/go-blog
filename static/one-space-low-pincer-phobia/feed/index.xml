		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m right there with you, but with more moves than just the 3-4 pincer!  I have an instructor that says to simply find the best move that benefits you.  That in and of itself makes sense.  It also relieves the pressure I sometimes feel to just start busying myself with memorization.  But at the same time, how do you know what&#039;s the best move in the beginning.  Understanding is better than memorization sure.  But understanding is not as easy to come by as memorization in my experience.  Thanks Ben!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[To be honest, it very well might have been. The only problem is that I didn&#039;t really respond well to the Get Strong at Joseki series since my knowledge was quite limited and the methodology wasn&#039;t suited to my learning style.
In case you&#039;re thinking about getting it though, it seems to be more promising than the original Dictionary of Basic Joseki by Yoshida Ishio 9p since its more contemporary and pretty straightforward. I&#039;ll be sure to post a review once I&#039;ve gotten a better handle on it.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m very jealous that you were able to get that book! My own library has helped me immensely, but it is much too small.
Was this not covered in Get Strong at Joseki?]]></description>
