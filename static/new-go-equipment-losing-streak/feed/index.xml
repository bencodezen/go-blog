		<description><![CDATA[I applaud your perspective! I have to admit that although I would love to maintain such a vision, but I know I&#039;m still caught up in the competition of it all. Haha. But I will try and think about what you said and focus on the enjoyment of playing (instead of the winning aspect). =D Thanks for the advice!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Over time I am trying to worry less about competition and focus more about learning as much as possible about go (as this is what I enjoy about go).
Worrying about competition has begun to seem silly right now in a game were there is a world of difference in my play when compared to even a dan level player. Why should I care if a single person has bested me when so many can do the same in an even more convincing manner? Separating winning games from enjoying playing seems necessary to understand the game to me.
This is my aim, but i think it will be harder to implement when I am playing than I think.]]></description>
