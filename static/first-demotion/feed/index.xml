		<description><![CDATA[Thanks Todd! I will be sure to try and enjoy myself in League B. I guess it can be tough having reality not match your expectations. Ah well, I want to gain true strength anyways. Don&#039;t want to be a fake dan when the time comes. =)
Yes yes! Let&#039;s fire our bow onwards!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Lots of nice advice already.  I&#039;d just like to add: remember to enjoy yourself in the B league. Being upset about the bad things is okay for a little while, maybe, but after you see the demotion, the B league is just where you are.  Start where you are, over and over again, and remember to enjoy it!  Dreaming of when we&#039;ll be stronger, that is nice, but it shouldn&#039;t take away from where we&#039;re at: here we are, where we are, aimed toward the future ... let go of the bowstring!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks for such a thoughtful response. I think you are absolutely right in that the panic and sadness can be helpful in breaking our habits. Though obviously as you mentioned, the trouble with go is sometimes you have a hard time distinguishing between the good and bad habits.
I have no idea what next month has in store for me, but I plan on giving it my all so that there will be no regrets at the end of it.
Thanks again for your feedback. Really appreciate it!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Your last post was about the struggle inherent in learning: congratulations on an excellent learning opportunity ;)
If you can master the emotional up&#039;s and down&#039;s of Go, you&#039;ll have gained a vitally useful skill for most aspects of life.
Everyone&#039;s unique, but what I strive for is to feel the icy stab of sadness and remorse as soon as I see a game has fallen apart. So much stronger the regret when the game is big like yours was! For a few moments I revel in self doubt while running through a checklist of everything I know I did wrong: missed tesuji, playing too late at night, cockiness or fear. Then I nod to myself, accept the outcome, and try to reach inner calm again.
I believe the panic and sadness and anger are actually very useful. They&#039;re accompanied by dopamine withdrawal from your brain which breaks bad habits (hence thinking about what went wrong). But Go is a subtle game and too much, I think, breaks good habits along with the bad. And worse, your brain might decide to break the habit of playing Go(!!!) So a little, productive, negative emotion. And then calm again. (easier said then done...)
Losses are chances to refine our game, demotions doubly so. So congrats on the opportunity, maybe you&#039;ll be lucky enough to get stuck at B class next month and feel it again ;)]]></description>
