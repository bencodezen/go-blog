		<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s pretty rare for an amateur to have the time and resources to devote to the game, as well as the raw talent and insight required to become truly great, and not end up crossing over to become a pro.
So, while most amateurs likely have little chance of beating a pro in an even game, and some books even feature pros saying it&#039;ll basically never happen, there are noted exceptions.
One such is Fernando Aguilar 7d, who has, at least twice now, beaten 9p professionals in even games.
By convention, he&#039;s called a 7d amateur, since there simply isn&#039;t a higher available rank of amateur to call him. But it appears no one informed his game of that. ;-)
For reference see http://senseis.xmp.net/?FernandoAguilar and the (out of print?) Suji Magazine #3, Page 8.
It&#039;s a big world...]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thank you, Master! (Takagawa was once asked who was stronger Sakata Eio or Go Siegen - since they both sort of owned him. He said something to the effect, &quot;Go Siegen, but if someone else said Sakata Eio it would be difficult to argue.&quot; Very Japanese although Takagawa was especially humble - and at least this poor ddk has at least a vague idea of his style. :))]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Aren&#039;t you so funny Molokai? I don&#039;t imagine I&#039;d ever be deserving of ever being called &quot;Master.&quot; Haha. Just a humble go player embarking on the journey we are all on.
To answer your questinos though:
(1) 7 dan amateur is generally considered to be the strongest amateur rank one can achieve  in person (excluding online systems which can run up to 9 dan). There have been claims that strong 7 dans can play professionals with a 1-2 stones handicap, but I wouldn&#039;t go as far to say as they are equivalent.
(2) If by honorary you mean a title that is won through competition, then yes you would be correct. But otherwise, it&#039;s not a title that&#039;s simply bestowed upon a selected player. Think of the 10 dan designation (aka Judan) as Meijin or Kisei. Does that make sense?
I&#039;m glad that you enjoy my go commentaries, but I still have a long way to go. Be sure to let me know if you ever have any pointers on things I can do to improve the value of the game reviews!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I have questions for the Master, please. 1) Is 7d amateur equivalent to 1d professional or latter one level higher? 2) 10d professional is &#039;honorary&#039; title or something similar? I was looking at old Oza Sen match in Go Review (Feb 1973) between Sakata Eio and Hashimoto and Sakata is listed &#039;10-Dan&#039; to Hashimoto &#039;9-Dan.&#039; Looking forward to studying your Monday Meditation game this weekend! You are the best Go analyst, Ben!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Ben, I think you&#039;re doing a superb job and deeply appreciate every journal entry. I sure don&#039;t blame you for trying your best to improve in this beautiful, absorbing game because even as a rank amateur beginner it&#039;s grabbed me like an octopus around my face. I do think it is a tremendous service to the Go playing community when you publish your absolutely superb game reviews in your blog.  I cannot get enough of them and must have six open right now because I keep going through them over and over again.  I look forward to seeing you in the future at one of the tournaments downtown.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Same here! Alas, I can&#039;t seem to pull myself away from it though. It seems I am obsessed with getting stronger and can&#039;t quit the pursuit. Haha.
And it might not have been clear, but I&#039;m just going to be releasing a book review. However, if I ever do get into book publishing in the future, I can guarantee you that it will be available in all popular formats!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s hard (for me) to find the right balance when studying Go.  The more I study, the more I realize there is more to study!  I try to always keep it fun.  If it&#039;s not fun, I&#039;m not doing it right.  Will your book be kindle-able?]]></description>
