		<description><![CDATA[Thanks for your feedback Todd! The new review layout will definitely be including pretty much everything you mentioned.
In regards to the section regarding expectations before the book, that was something I had felt iffy about before. After some other people&#039;s feedback, it&#039;s being changed to focus more on where I stood going into the book in order to give more context to my review. Example: I&#039;ve already read 3 other books on attack and defense or Life and death is a strong suit of mine. Do you think that would be more useful?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[General teaching style (lots of raw variations vs. lots of exposition on a few key concepts, for instance, or lots of full out games in multiple figures vs. small set pieces in diagrams) is good to know, as well as if that style seems to fit the topic.
I also want to know what you personally liked about it and what you disliked about it.  How difficult was it at your level, and did the work pay off in the end in your opinion. Because there ARE other places I can read reviews, but if I&#039;m reading YOUR review, I want to know what YOU thought of it.
How much do you see the book being of use to different ranked readers, how hard would it be for a second or third or fourth Go book, which books might be better at different levels, how it compares to other similar books in general.
Measure that all up as pros vs. cons, and give an over-all rating based on your personal opinion almost regardless of the list of pros and cons.  If the number really does ignore the list of pros and cons, tell us why!  That makes for an interesting review!
The one thing I really didn&#039;t like about the review was a section on your expectations before reading the book.  That&#039;s only really interesting if the book either was a total let down or a surprise masterpiece, it doesn&#039;t usually add much to the review to list out every expectation.  That&#039;s my taste, anyways.  But heck, I also like Angry Joe  video game reviews so maybe you shouldn&#039;t be asking me.:)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I realise I&#039;ve rambled on about what I expect in a Go book, rather than a review - I suppose how well the author has avoided the pitfalls and managed the positive would be what I&#039;d like to see in the review!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Please - not an information dump - clearly written - preferably with relevant examples, similies and metaphors - most people still find Go obscure in the extreme, once the initial rules are set out. The progression has to make sense - I&#039;ve seen too many Go beginner manuals showing an empty board on page one and page two is a board littered with numbered stones. Most people will throw this down and run away.
Graded Go Problems for Beginners series is good and progresses well. Janice Kim is also good for the beginner.
I think too many Go players have forgotten how it felt at the start and always assume more prior knowledge than most of their audience possesses.
Once experienced players are reading specific books on particular areas these initial problems reduce, however I think vast tracts of dense text, obscure comments, assumed knowledge and a humourless and convoluted style lose many potential Go players early on.
Kalli Balduin&#039;s Big Book of Go Problems allows real stones to be placed on the pages and discussion and experimentation to take place. An excellent idea.]]></description>
