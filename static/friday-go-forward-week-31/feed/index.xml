		<description><![CDATA[Haha. I would definitely say that playing at least one game every other day would be great if i could manage it. Sometimes I feel like it&#039;s hard to even get in one or two games a week. Going to have to fix that somehow. Haha.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[My problem is probably the opposite. I study just enough to get my go fix, then waist my time on other things. Leaving almost all those potential go games unplayed.
I think i need to stop studying and just play the damn game. :)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s certainly quite a bit to juggle. =D This week has been crazy though. It&#039;s been tough. Haha. But on the other hand, don&#039;t forget that I don&#039;t get to play as often. So I got to get my go fix somehow. =P]]></description>
