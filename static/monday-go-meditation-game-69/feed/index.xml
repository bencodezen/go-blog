		<description><![CDATA[Well said. I&#039;ll be sure to keep these things in mind as I continue reviewing my games. Perhaps I will try and add more rationale to each move as I go through them instead of just commenting on my mood at the time. Thanks for your in depth insight!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[well, you SHOULD strive for 100% efficiency. That&#039;s what professionals do. efficiency, by definition is ALWAYS good. but if you go for 110%, you lose :) so never settle for low efficiency... but a game of Go cannot be won several times in a row without the result reversing in the middle... you can&#039;t win, and win by more, and then by more... there&#039;s only &quot;win&quot;... so if you&#039;re not sure you&#039;re not stretching beyond the 100% efficiency and want to make sure... THEN it&#039;s the time to ask if you really need it.
I think in the opening in this game it seemed clear that your position is quite good if you just play normally. if you didn&#039;t think so, then you were correct in trying to play something else. if you thought so yourself.... then why? :)
Because telling yourself you&#039;re just looking for more efficiency can easily be a self comforting lie - as you will notice - you provided no explanation as to why you thought the tenuki seemed better than the normal variation, or why you didn&#039;t like the position itself, so it doesn&#039;t seem like there was any attempt to improve efficiency there... just experimentation... which can be nice sometimes, as long as you realize that&#039;s what you&#039;re doing...
and that the immediate result is often not good :)
The difficult part of playing well (not near perfect...just well), is in forcing ourselves to not lie to ourselves, to have the self discipline to go over our options, and their ups and down, to ask ourselves the right questions, and to avoid playing on instinct when we have time to check if it is misleading us...
I fail that all the time myself.
Most people do.
How often do you play something only to tell yourself afterwards that you actually missed something you have encountered many times before and that you just played too fast not realizing it? or that you ignored something you&#039;ve seen a hundred times? for the vast majority of people, the answer is - quite often indeed. Myself included...
Reading ability may come with practice. The same could be said of shape recognition, counting, openings etc.
self discipline is the one thing which will always be a foe to most people, regardless of how knowledgeable, skilled or trained they are.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Fair enough. I think part of my issue is that I try to do everything as efficiently as possible. So when I feel like I&#039;m only getting like a 70% efficiency rate, I abandon it because of my greed for the 100% efficiency. Haha. A flaw that I will certainly have to work on.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[actually, complications are fine... and often correct. it&#039;s just that going for them if you have an easy solution without them seems strange to me. I still like to complicated things a lot (basically since my fellow equally ranked players won&#039;t let me get simple solutions (that I can find) that easily... so complications is often the way to go :)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thank you for the in depth advice! Though the game ended up being a big difference, the game overall still held a bit of a challenge for me as I tried to figure out what to do. You make an excellent point about how &quot;complicated continuations tend to be overplays.&quot; I am probably quite guilty of that as I am usually eager to plunge into the abyss of a fight (though it probably leaves me at a disadvantage more often than not. Haha).
Glad you enjoyed the game! Hopefully we will have a chance to play against one another in the near future!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The opening was interesting and unusual... the position that appears on the bottom edge with the black shimari facing white&#039;s 4-4 appears in almost every (if not in all) opening theory book or opening problem book that ever came out... It&#039;s almost always the biggest edge on the board this early because it&#039;s 3 stones all wanting to develop on that edge.
So the normal theory is that whoever plays there first gets the edge (pun is totally intended...)
You actually have 2 options there. one is where you mentioned - right in the middle at K3. The other option is L3. It&#039;s actually a more modern, active way to handle that edge, where white leaves invasion space but gets to make black&#039;s part of the formation suffer more. Both are ok.
Not sure about the top right. I would personally finish the joseki once it started because I think it&#039;s a simple way to give white a better game as well :)
Interesting approach. Personally I treat complicated continuations as overplays if there&#039;s a simple one that works (and almost always play them otherwise :P )
but the star point on the left side... I can&#039;t bet my life on it, but I&#039;m pretty sure that showing it to a professional or a similarly strong player would get the response that it might be ok but the lower edge is still bigger... 3 stones want to develop there vs. 2 on the left... That&#039;s the way I interpret that anyway.
Once black decided to not take your base on the right side (he could have tried) and let you settle there easily, I think you needed to try hard to lose from that point :) you were far ahead.
Nice game. I enjoyed it]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Ah. Excellent point. For some reason I thought that Black would play there instead as a ko threat, but you are absolutely right. Thanks for the insight!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[nice and amusing game :)
About the ko at the top - you don&#039;t really need to descent first, since it&#039;s a ko threat for you, as if you take the ko and black played there, you just connect... and black suffers from too many liberty issues and cutting points to survive this. It would not be a ko at all if he does that :) So it&#039;s just a free ko threat.]]></description>
