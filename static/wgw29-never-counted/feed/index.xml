		<description><![CDATA[Absolutely. And you&#039;ll learn more about endgame when you&#039;re SDK too. Don&#039;t worry for now. A game with only 3.5 points difference is awesome!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Well, I can give you great example why counting counts ;) of course you will tell me that it will improve with time (books already in country, ETA tomorrow AM CET ;)) ) but yesterday in one rated game played, I was sure I was winning, and at the end I found myself loose by 3.5 moku ;) it is true that I had not that many options towards the end but if I knew I was behind, I would try some forcing moves to reduce opponent territory]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I also tend to avoid counting. I just finished reading Attack and Defense by Ishida and Davies. One thing that I learned is that when you&#039;re behind, it&#039;s time to make a risky, daring attack; when you&#039;re ahead, it&#039;s time to defensively solidify your lead. So I guess estimating the score is important.]]></description>
