		<description><![CDATA[My &#039;Conversation&#039; with Lee Sedol...
MC: Are you ready to play Bengozen?
LS: Never heard of him. New 9p?
MC: Perhaps even stronger!
LS: Noooo!!! What is his style?
MC: They say he is 21st century Go Siegen. He begins with 1.
L11.
LS: Ha! Even beginner know that is not a good first move. It
takes many stones to make territory in the center.
MC: But Bengozen has looked further. He says that is true
but it takes even more stones to surround it, kill!
LS: Ahh...!?!
MC: He also plays Reverse Moyo strategy.
LS: Reverse Moyo? What is that?
MC: Make influence from center. Then sides and corners
become his more easily, make territory. In regular Moyo only 50% become
territory. In Bengozen Reverse Moyo - 70%!
LS: How he discover this Reverse Moyo?
MC: He study Takagawa games standing on head, looking in
mirror.
LS: A genius! This Bengozen is too strong for me. Tell him I
am busy with Gu Li jubango!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Being able to learn your weaknesses through introspection is a great strength that is important to any competitive sport. I am happy that you now have a chance to overcome it.
This post also reminded me of some professional go players that were discussed in &quot;The Master Of Go&quot; by Yusanari Kawabata.
One player sat with his eyes closed while waiting for his opponent to play. The reason he did this was that during this time he was ridding himself of the desire to win.
Another young professional nonchalantly opened up and read a magazine while waiting for his opponent to play. Kawabata mentions that this player had later gone insane, and  he thinks that because of his precarious state of nerves he could not stand the time of deliberation while waiting for his opponent to play.
Just something to think about.]]></description>
