		<description><![CDATA[Well it is thanks to you that this article was written! I&#039;m glad you found it helpful! And for so you know what&#039;s coming in a couple of weeks, the next one will deal with playing as white with a 2 stone handicap! Be sure to let me know if there&#039;s anything else you ever come up with. =D]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The reason why area counting rules have 1 point more komi is because black is usually able to play 1 more stone in the game(and every stone is worth exactly one point using those rules). This usually ends up to be very close to the same result that would have been gotten in a 6.5 japanese rules game. It is exactly the same result in aga (aga rules were designed to be the same regardless of whether area or territory scoring is used), and often the same result in chinese rules. Using 6.5 komi in these rules would favor black a little bit more.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[In regards to your first point, no worries about it. The losing streak will pass and you will have learned from it. All in due time. =)
So in terms of a quick and sweet answer to your question about komi, it&#039;s because the value of having the first move has yet to be calculated to mathematical precision. Komi, in general these days, ranges anywhere from 5.5 to 8. Haha. The only two you really need to know about though are AGA (7.5 komi) and Japanese (6.5 komi). Other than that, I wouldn&#039;t worry about the slight differences between komi. They don&#039;t make a difference at our level. xD
To your third question, I do not think sanrensei is undefeatable. In fact, it has fallen out of popularity with professionals due to the fact it&#039;s very straightforward and it&#039;s been played for so long that counter strategies are well known. It&#039;s just a good fuseki to use to learn about attacking and moyos. =)
All you have to remember about star points is that they are never meant to take territory. You can lose the corner anytime due to any number of reasons besides the 3-3. =) Though I&#039;m not sure if that&#039;s what you were getting at, so let me know if I missed anything or if you have any other questions!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Good points. You know, this whole post reminds me of that one scene from Hikaru No Go where Hikaru and Sai find out about the komi rule. &quot;I have never lost a game when playing as black.&quot; Truthfully, I cannot remember the last game I took white and won in a real time game but that&#039;s probably due to the fact that I always play too fast in real time games have been on a losing streak for the past month or so. Anyhow, I have a question, and I am not sure if you have looked into this or not but why does the komi rule keep on changing (the go club dudes are getting confused because when we play against each other, for simplicity, we use 5.5 but sometimes, online, they play with 6.5)? I know its changed over the years. It used to be 6.5 and then 5.5 and in some places, its 7.5. Also, why do you think that the sanrensei is undefeatable? I have played numerous games where I have been able to take at least one corner without the 3-3. Thanks for the post! Enjoyed it a lot!]]></description>
