		<description><![CDATA[#16 - You are correct in questioning the book&#039;s answer key. As you suspected, the theme is that connected stones are stronger than groups that are split apart. And since the White stones are connected via bamboo joint while the Black stones are completely separated, the answer should be White.
#18 - In this problem, it is Black who is connected via bamboo joint and it is White who has no way of connecting his groups. As a result, the stronger group is Black.
Does that help clear things up?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hey Ben, I don&#039;t know if you want to discuss answers to specific problems and become Go tutor to the world, but I thought I&#039;d throw this out.  Let me know if you are open to this kind of thing, or if you aren&#039;t, please nuke this comment.
Level up 3, page 77, #16.  The general theme of these problems seems to be that connected groups are stronger.  Do you agree with the answer book that the black stones are stronger?
How about #18, which doesn&#039;t have an answer?]]></description>
