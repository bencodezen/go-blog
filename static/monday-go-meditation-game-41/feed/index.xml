		<description><![CDATA[Oh wow!  That was a magnificent game!  Watching really high-level games I have trouble following them, but this is just high enough to be really cool without being so lofty as to be beyond my comprehension.  Besides which -- so much drama!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Looking back, I displayed some insane hubris in letting the group on the right get so close to death. (I depended on at least two mistakes from white to live.) But I had two easy opportunities to keep it safe: http://eidogo.com/#3RwGrUkt:0,99 and http://eidogo.com/#3RwGrUkt:0,0,1. I don&#039;t know what I was thinking. Anyway, my claim to be 2k will really be put to the test at the NJ Open. If I can get three wins at that rank, I&#039;ll be strutting like a peacock.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Glad you enjoyed it! I think a lot of players have a tough time when playing against the Chinese Opening, so I&#039;m happy to show these games where I show a counter strategy to it.
And in regards to the double hane reading mistake, I can definitely attest to making that mistake numerous times and forgetting my opponent doesn&#039;t have to sacrifice. Haha. Ah well. At least we know what we&#039;re doing wrong! =)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[That&#039;s a pretty epic game - full of ko fights and exchanges, and a nice example of early development strategies against the Chinese opening. I echo your advice to always open facing black, rather than diagonal from him. Simply asserting that you are happy to accept a cross-fuseki as white seems to me like a positive, confident way to begin a game.
It was also reassuring to see your reading mistake at W132 with the double hane on the second line - I&#039;ve made that same mistake at least five times. It&#039;s like the joy of discovering how powerful that double hane to cut off can be runs ahead of my carefulness in checking if my opponent can simply fix in the original direction and leave my reckless stone adrift.]]></description>
