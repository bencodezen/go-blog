		<description><![CDATA[To be honest, I think it&#039;s been a long time since I&#039;ve played a game of (online) go where I&#039;m free of distraction. I have a feeling that you both are onto something in regards to the position I&#039;m putting myself in before each game. I&#039;ll be sure to try and make sure I&#039;m calm and free of distractions the next time I play. Thanks for your advice!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I think Nate has a good idea there.  Although I don&#039;t do those same things, I learned a while ago that if I&#039;m going to play a serious game of go, I need to be somewhere where I won&#039;t be distracted, and I also have to be calm.  I don&#039;t know if this is true for other people, but when I play games, I&#039;ve noticed that if I&#039;m feeling very sad, angry, distracted, or even happy about something, then I simply can&#039;t play as good of a game of go as I could when I&#039;m calm.  So while focus is a big part of my go, I&#039;ve found that unless I&#039;m calm, free of distractions for the duration of the game, and, when I&#039;m online, have a good internet connection, then I can&#039;t expect to do well. For me at least, the mindset I&#039;m in will determine how focused I am.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hmm... You bring up an excellent point. Perhaps it&#039;s not so much that I need to &quot;focus better to improve my go,&quot; but instead I need to put myself in the proper mindset (i.e., the rituals you mentioned) in order to allow myself to give the proper attention that each game deserves.
Thanks for your insight. I definitely think it&#039;s a step in the right direction for me. Looking forward to seeing how it impacts my play.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I saw Ken Burns speak at PBS a few years ago, and he said that one of the reason he&#039;s dedicated his life to making long movies is that he wants to fight against the war on our focus. &quot;Our focus is the most precious thing we have.&quot;
For me and for many people our age (if I may be so bold - I know you&#039;re almost a generation younger), this is the defining struggle of our adulthood. How can we give enough sustained attention to the things that are most rewarding?
(I really wish I could track down the translation of the words that are hung in the tournament room of the Nihon Kiin that&#039;s shown so many times in Hikaru no Go. I think they say something relevant...)
For me, I don&#039;t try to focus better in order to improve my go. I play go because the way it teaches me to focus is one of the most important things for my soul. When I approach an important game, I go through rituals that help me prepare for something deep and all-consuming. I make tea, or I make myself a place to sit. I close down other apps (if I&#039;m on the computer), then I place the computer where I can see it but where I have to rise in order to play a move. Then I try to imagine Shifu sitting over my shoulder, like Sai. And then I tell myself to smile. &quot;Onegaishimasu!&quot;
I don&#039;t do all of this every time, but when I do I find I get to a better place with my go. And it serves as a model for how to approach anything important in my life.]]></description>
