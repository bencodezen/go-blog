		<description><![CDATA[Thanks Rob! This is definitely something that also plagues my game as well and if I ever discover a cure for it, I&#039;ll be sure to let you know. =) Glad you enjoy the reviews! I&#039;ll be sure to keep posting them! =D]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This game pinpoints my worse bad habit.  Sometimes it seems I make moves with a great theory or idea attached to them only to need to abandon my concept in the face of my opponents better plays.  sigh...  I do admit being angry with myself when this happens.  every game.  many times.  Still, I learned a lot from this kifu and appreciate you taking the time to make it available. Keep up the great work, Ben.    Rob]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I thought K12 was pretty direct in removing eyes from Black. But in all honesty man, we all make those kinds of moves. =) And at the end of the game, it was a slaughter by White. So nothing to worry about! =D]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I made to many moves without thinking this game =(.  Moves like E7 and K12, both of which I&#039;m nearly certain I don&#039;t need and spent so little time thinking about, just really annoy me.  &#062;.&#060;]]></description>
