		<description><![CDATA[Not at all! You made some very good decisions throughout the early game that put you far ahead.  Your opponent made a desperate gamble and caught you in a series of mistakes, any one of which would have resulted in a won game for you (ko, connection to center, o9).  It&#039;s easy for me to critique in hindsight, but hard to execute under pressure =)
nice review, keep up the interesting content!]]></description>
