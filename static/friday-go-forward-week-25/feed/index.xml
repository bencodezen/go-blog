		<description><![CDATA[I think you&#039;re absolutely right. I definitely think that I&#039;ve been short changing myself when it comes to theory vs. application. I think part of it was due to a busy schedule, but in reality, it&#039;s all just one big excuse isn&#039;t it? Haha. So with that said, you&#039;re right.

		<description><![CDATA[I think it&#039;s great that you&#039;ve devoted so much energy to understanding the fundamentals and trying to get rid of any glaring mistakes in the way you play.  Fixing the little stuff can really add up over time and help you get stronger.  However, if I may say, I don&#039;t really get the feeling that you play enough games to really put all that extra knowledge you have into practice.  After all, you said it yourself, you play mostly handicap games, and in handicap games, its mostly about overplaying as white (unless you&#039;re a pro, than your moves are just straight up awesome and you don&#039;t need to overplay =) or, as black, trying to punish said overplays.  While there are valuable lessons to be learned as black in a handicap game, the same can&#039;t necessarily be said for white, so in most cases, only one player has a chance to learn anything.  And, the way most people play handicap games is different from the way they play even games, so assuming that that is true for you, you&#039;re not getting the chances you need to put your knowledge into practice.  After all, knowledge and application are two different things.  Though I doubt this will happen to you since these books aren&#039;t introducing very many new concepts to you, merely explaining them in a different way, let&#039;s say that you misinterpret a lesson in one of those books.  It&#039;s better to find out that you had the wrong idea on an online game than to go to a tournament and find out about it in a game there.  I guess what I&#039;m trying to say, and probably could have done with a lot less words, is that studying and playing are every bit as important as one another.  If you only focus on one, you&#039;re just short changing yourself.  Well, enough of my pontification, best of luck with your progress Ben =).]]></description>
