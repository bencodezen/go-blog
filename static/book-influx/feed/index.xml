		<description><![CDATA[I just almost bought the Jump Level Up series used, but they were sadly priced in Euros and had to ship from Germany, so I might as well pick them up from YMI after exchange and shipping.  Now I&#039;m really interested in picking them up (anything to keep me moving through this plateau I&#039;m at!), once my Go book budget recovers from the books that only just got here last week.;)  I&#039;m looking forward to seeing what you think of them: maybe they take things slow but maybe that&#039;s good for someone who just keeps bouncing between 7 and 10 kyu for months at a time?]]></description>
