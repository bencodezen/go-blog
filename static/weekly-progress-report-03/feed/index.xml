Wow. A second endorsement! Now I really have to check it out now. Thanks so much for taking the time to share your opinion. I hope to see you around the comments again in the future!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m enjoying your blog Ben!
I&#039;m going to join Terri&#039;s comment.  I&#039;ve been using Guo Juan&#039;s Training System for 3 months now - starting with a pre-release version.  I use it every day.  It&#039;s fun and it&#039;s *exactly* what I&#039;ve needed to improve.  I watch one of Guo Juan&#039;s lectures, such as her fantastic series on Joseki for Beginners (Which I&#039;m sure any 1 Dan will learn tons from), then add the problem set for that lecture.  I&#039;m very comfortably studying 1500 problems now, and almost never forget them before they come up for another review.  Here&#039;s a link:

		<description><![CDATA[I say you should review games more than play them. Tsumego and others are a great way to lose yourself in small, territorial questions and forget the fundamentals, as well as global state of the board. I think I linked you this book before.

		<description><![CDATA[I am so glad you asked about the problem review. Ordinarily one would be taking problems from a book or some other source. That would allow one to measure his review in terms of number of problems or amount of time spent, so your question is a natural one to ask.
With the Training System over at Guo Juan&#039;s internet Go School, however, things are different. The Training System takes care of the details for you. You can accept the default parameters for how many new problems to be shown each day, or you can set your own parameters. Then once you have started to use the system it will present you with review problems based on how you rated them previously, new problems based on how many you want to see each day, and your review will come to and end when you have been presented with a certain number of review and new problems based on your parameters, or a total number of problems, which is also in the parameters. I often click a new problem as being &quot;hard&quot; which will force the system to present it to me again within ten minutes. I think that each of those individual presentations will count as a problem for the purpose of bringing the review session to an end.
So basically, you hit the button to start reviewing. Then you do the problems in the order in which they are presented. You rate their difficulty so they will show up again on a schedule that is suited to your particular review needs. You keep going until the system gives you a message saying you are done for the day. At that point you can stop for the day or you can override the system and ask it to give you 15 more questions. You are also reminded that you can set new parameters if you desire.
It takes all of the guess work out of reviewing and it prevents you from seeing problems that are too easy too often. I have problems that are set to show up in 43 days based on my ratings of their difficulty.
I would love for you to at least try the two free lectures with problem sets so you can experience this. Read about the details over at the Internet Go School.
I did time myself once, and my problem review takes me approximately 20 minutes each day. That is a reasonable amount of time for anyone to devote to problem study.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I am working on crafting my own Training Regimen. So far I have two things in place.
1. Two hour lessons with Yilun Yang on alternate Thursdays
2. Daily problem review using the Training System at Guo Juan&#039;s Internet Go School.
The next thing that I want to add to my training regimen is going to be rated 19 x 19 games on KGS. I am thinking that I want to have a game per day, but I think I might phrase that as seven games per week, which would allow me to meet my requirements early in the week. or to play catch up at the end of the week.
I want to start those rated games soon.
I think this comment is going to get fleshed out and become a blog post :-)]]></description>
