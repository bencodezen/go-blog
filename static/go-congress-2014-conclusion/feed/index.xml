		<description><![CDATA[True true, but at least that would require some digging. And to be honest, I am probably just concerned with games that are one-sided where it could be embarrassing for my opponent. And since I think it would be a tad odd to ask every opponent if they are okay with me posting the game on my blog with their name on the kifu, I usually just anonymize it unless it&#039;s a friend (just to be safe).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hahaha. I think it&#039;s great you ask them for permission. And I think it&#039;s great that you almost got every single one of your opponents! For me, my key memorabilia from each match is the kifu. And I don&#039;t know if it&#039;s just me, but I&#039;m always worried people would rather be anonymous than be identified (since I post all my game records on the blog). Maybe it&#039;s just me being crazy though. Haha.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I do ask permission to take their picture before we play. I explain that I am taking pictures of all of my opponents in the US Open. I don&#039;t say I will post the pictures on my blog, but maybe I will say that next year, or I&#039;ll just do it. I think people like that kind of thing.
I forgot to take a picture of the Round 3 opponent, and never did track her down to get one later. I didn&#039;t take one of my 5th Round opponent until after the game was over. I had won it, and we went to report the results and then I asked him if he would return to the board for a photograph, which he did. He was really nice so I felt as if I could ask him. I said, &quot;Pretend the game hasn&#039;t happened yet&quot;. Or something like that. I had a perverse impulse to say, &quot;Pretend you still have a chance to win.&quot; because he was a really nice guy, and was taking the loss well, but that would have been way over the top, so I held my tongue.]]></description>
