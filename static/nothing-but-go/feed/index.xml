		<description><![CDATA[No no. You definitely reminded me of how important it is to enjoy the current moment of go instead of constantly pursuing kame no itte.
As you articulated so well, the journey to gain another stone is never ending. So it&#039;s really important we enjoy every step of the way. =D]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Well, it&#039;s not that I&#039;m reminding you; I don&#039;t think it&#039;s a point you&#039;re forgetting.

		<description><![CDATA[What a great point. After all, I can never see myself going, &quot;Look at me everyone! I&#039;m so strong!&quot; In fact, I&#039;m pretty I&#039;ll always be gazing above going, &quot;Wow... those players are so strong!&quot; xD
It&#039;s definitely true that we need to focus on what makes go worthwhile now. Thanks for reminding me!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ll add a point I often harp on: it&#039;s important to ask what strength would satisfy you. One dan? Three dan? Seven dan? Professional?
As you say, most of us will never be professionals, but I&#039;d add something: would we want go to be something where becoming a professional is the only really satisfying goal? Isn&#039;t it better - and in fact a beautiful feature of go - that its incredible vitality and fascination is amply available to amateurs? To those of us who fit go in with already busy lives?
I will never be terribly strong at go, but I do think I have a pretty reasonable shot at reaching shodan before too many years have passed. And if I&#039;m lucky and continue to work at it, I might be able to nudge myself up a couple stones above that. But will I ever stop, put my hands on my hips, and say, HOW STRONG AM I!
Nah. So it&#039;s important to pay attention to what makes go worthwhile NOW.
Anyway. I know I&#039;ve ranted about this before.]]></description>
