		<description><![CDATA[Thanks, good to hear it.  To be honest, even though am a fairly new follower of the blog, was feeling a little guilty about never having said thanks for all the cool stuff I&#039;ve enjoyed here.  Glad those demons were put to rest. :)
Never actually played an OTB game but am really looking forward to it (seems like it would be fun to be able to play tournaments someday too).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Sounds interesting (for the primary reason you listed) as do these: http://senseis.xmp.net/?WholeBoardThinkingInJoseki   Probably not appropriate for my level, but something to look forward too. :)
Gonna take the opportunity to say thank you - for all the love and fun you put into this blog!  It&#039;s one of the best mind sport pages I&#039;ve run across.  Have found a good deal of useful information and even a little inspiration here.
For example, am just about to finish up with GGPFB vol 2 and read somewhere on here (in the comments I think) were you suggest starting with 1001 Life &#038; Death Problems at least before moving on to GGPFB vol 3.  Have noticed 1001 sitting on my shelf and thought, &quot;that book is gonna learn me something about this game once I finally get to it&quot; - the day will come a little sooner then anticipated. :)  Your enthusiasm for the game is infectious (in a good way).
Thanks again and, best wishes in your journey with Go!]]></description>
