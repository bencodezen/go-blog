		<description><![CDATA[Based on what I&#039;ve researched, insei training is very geared towards playing lots of games and game reviews by stronger players. Of course, this is a proven method that has produced many professionals; however, the flaw I find in this program is the fact that amateurs cannot engage in this type of study the way insei do. So my goal is to hopefully build a program that is catered to the non-professional go community. =)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Ah I see! I will be sure to consider your blueprint as I&#039;m formulating one myself. I&#039;m hoping to design guidelines for players who need a more detailed training menu:
Example:
- 50 Easy Life and Death Problems
- 10 Intermediate Life and Death Problems
- 1 Full Game Review where you must determine the purpose of every move.
- And so on and so on...

		<description><![CDATA[You make an excellent point. I think part of my search is also determining the actual training menu that allows a person to make consistent progress. Similar to the boxing training menu, I&#039;m hoping to design a go training menu as well to make consistent progress. =)]]></description>
