		<description><![CDATA[As always, your comments are always incredibly kind and I can&#039;t thank you enough for taking the time to write such a great comment. They always serve as a beacon of motivation when I feel a little discouraged from writing.
Thanks again for your kind words. I hope that we will get to see each other at a tournament in the near future!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Ben,  Thank you so much for posting this game for everyone to review. I know many people are not as humble as you. Heck, even in my personal journal no one will ever see until after my death it seems that I walk on water and never do anything wrong because I tend to only write about successes versus failures when of course I can learn much more from my failures. That&#039;s one of the things I love about your post, you don&#039;t hesitate to show the good,bad, or ugly. In this particular game your comments were very helpful to me. For example, I never realized the sanrensei opening is an attacking formation until you mentioned it. Also, I did not know or understand that blacks number four move was too low because of Black&#039;s opening positions. I appreciate you opening my eyes yet again my friend. Keep up the great work Ben, your posts are fabulous.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[In all honesty, Move 25 is a super overplay on my part that happened to work out for me due to a little hastiness on your part. =P Otherwise, I have to admit that playing 3 stones against you is such a pain. xD Hahaha.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I really enjoyed that game. Sometimes a battle of recovering from mutual blunders can be quite exciting.
Your points on the opening were interesting. I played shimaris with the theory that in a 3 stone handicap match I was better off developing slowly but solidly.
Move 25, punishing me for possibly reducing too far in reads better to me at O15 instead. In retrospect it makes sense you&#039;d resist, but I expected you to solidify your position at m16 and aim at the weakness of the deeper extension later.
That ladder was a killer for me. I&#039;ve got to learn to listen to the voices that encourage caution when ahead. If you play m14 the ladders all work for me, but you had L15 of course. At some point I should look deeper at losing stones to ladders more often, though. Getting two forcing moves in the center out of it helped me alot coming back.]]></description>
