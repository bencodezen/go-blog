		<description><![CDATA[Unfortunately the others I have are in Japanese, so it probably won&#039;t help you.  I have books authored by Yuki Satoshi and Lee Changho.  I imagine both are ghost written but the one by Yuki does include comments on his own games, so he probably had some input.  The Lee Changho one is also quite good at explaining how to value common shapes and invasion points.

I also have a much deeper book aimed simply at how to count by O Meien which is much more about the math of how to value areas with plays resulting from sente/gote and what order to play.

I don&#039;t have a review for the Yuki Satoshi one, since that&#039;s one I simply picked up at a used book store that looked interesting.  I was thinking of doing some write ups of other Japanese books when I had the time.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Awesome! And just so you&#039;re aware, I own a LOT of books and have worked through more than I&#039;ve reviewed. I just haven&#039;t finished the books so I don&#039;t feel at liberty to post a review just yet, so if you ever have any questions on what to get next (even if it&#039;s not on the review list), be sure to let me know!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thank you so much for recommending this! I&#039;ve only started a little bit of it, but considering that it&#039;s free content, it seems like it&#039;s very well done so far. After I finish going through it, I&#039;ll be sure to write a post about it if I feel it is as good as people have said it is. Thanks again!
PS. What other books have you read on positional judgment? I only have the one by Cho Chikun.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I haven&#039;t really read these, since I&#039;ve read many books on positional judgement.  However, I&#039;ve seen them recommended by many.

		<description><![CDATA[Sounds like a good plan.  I&#039;ve read Lessons at least twice, though I will be re-reading it soon.  I&#039;m using your reviews to make my wish list!!]]></description>
