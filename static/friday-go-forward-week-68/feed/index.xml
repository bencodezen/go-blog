		<description><![CDATA[You are too kind Molokai! And don&#039;t ever worry, if I am ever taking a break from blogging, I will be sure to let everyone know. I hate it when bloggers disappear with no intention to come back and never let their readers know. So no worries there!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Starting a game is a battle for me too man. It might seem like I&#039;m fearless to keep playing, but I realized that nothing will change unless I dive head in to the battlefield.  In order to get rid of the fear, I decided to challenge the fear till it became second nature.
Thanks for sharing the video! I&#039;ve added it to the list and will be sure to check it out soon. You can be sure that I will not give up, so no worries there!]]></description>
