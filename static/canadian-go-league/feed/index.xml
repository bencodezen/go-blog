		<description><![CDATA[I finally joined! xD I will be interested to hear your thoughts on my games with your old rivals when the time comes. Till then though, I will refrain from asking you about their styles. Hehe.
Thanks for breaking down the Canadian overtime for me. I never thought to break it up like that, but giving me the time per stone is really help and puts things in perspective. Thanks!
And yes, come up and catch up to me! I&#039;ll be waiting for you! =D (And in case it wasn&#039;t clear, I was trying to make a Hikaru No Go reference.)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[You finally joined!  You&#039;re only two divisions ahead of me, I must endeavour to catch up to you.  You&#039;re up against a couple people I&#039;ve played league games with in the past, it&#039;ll be fun to see you play my old rivals.
Canadian overtime in the league is 10 mins for 25 stones...you just need to average out to 600 secs/25 stones= 24 seconds per stone without going over the 10 minutes.]]></description>
