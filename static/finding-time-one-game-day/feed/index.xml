		<description><![CDATA[I remember doing this same thing last year, and with pretty good success if I do say so myself.  Though I no longer have the time to do it, I think that you&#039;re right about one game a day being beneficial for all players.  At the moment, though, I just want to be able to find the time to play one game before September is over =).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[That&#039;s awesome! So glad to hear that other people are doing it too. Haha. I personally prefer long games as well, but time is just not on my side lately. xD I&#039;m looking forward to seeing your games when you are ready to play on your main account again!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Nice! I figured that there was no way the only time you played go was during workshop and the occasional game with me. =P I would say that studying is only as good as the application. Granted, some players get by with studying and no playing; but I find that they are the minority. Especially since those kind of prodigies are generally insei anyways. =D
But I would say it wouldn&#039;t hurt to add tsumego to your &quot;study regimen&quot; if you wanted to feel like you were balancing it a bit more.  =)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve also been playing on a secret KGS account. I&#039;ll switch back soon, but I really wanted to weed out some of the more obvious embarrassing moves that have been happening from lack of playing. I have been successful in a game a day since that first post.
I use all time settings except blitz. I hope for a long game, but don&#039;t mind the practice at thinking quickly if a 10 minute one comes up.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Yeah, I&#039;ve been wondering whether I should just accept that my secret account for irresponsible blitzing might be responsible for my continued progress. It&#039;s at 4k, a solid notch below the 3k I can maintain with my playing carefully account, but I probably play at least six quick games a week, sometimes more, which means I&#039;ve gotten a lot more games in than I otherwise would have. Anyway, I don&#039;t know. It&#039;s so hard for me to say whether I think it&#039;s good or bad. I guess it&#039;s probably better than doing nothing related to go. But is it better than spending the corresponding amount of time studying? I don&#039;t know.]]></description>
