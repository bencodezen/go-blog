		<description><![CDATA[To your first point, I would have to say that KGS shodan is most certainly not unlikely for you. Haha. I certainly see it in the cards for you!
And to your next point, I think you&#039;ve hit on the important point: you&#039;re happy with the way things are now. Perhaps goals are just overrated and end up causing more frustration than anything else with something like go.
I don&#039;t think it has anything to do with you being an undriven person. In fact, I think your steady habits that produce consistent results is extremely admirable and something not enough people do. Oftentimes I see players try to put forth extraordinary amount of effort and then drop it all when they don&#039;t see results of relative scale and size.
In the end though, I know that one thing I will always be able to count on is a great game with you. =)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hmmm, reaching KGS shodan would be nice, but unlikely for me, given my pace over the last two years. Not impossible, I guess: reaching solid one kyu status isn&#039;t too much of a reach, and this would be just a stone beyond.
But, to be honest, I don&#039;t know how much setting a goal for myself would help. I play about as much go as my life will possibly allow, and I&#039;m making progress this way. I&#039;m actually feeling pretty happy with how things are going right now.
I know that reveals how undriven a person I am, but I think there&#039;s something to be said for settling into habits that steadily produce results vs. trying to summon the will to make extraordinary efforts. I have no doubt that I&#039;m doomed to never be an extraordinary player, but that wasn&#039;t REALLY in the cards for someone who started at my age, anyway. I think it meshes pretty well with my goal to enjoy go in a deeper and more profound way throughout my life pretty well.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[You bring up an excellent point. I guess to clarify, it&#039;s not so much that I&#039;m now confused about whether I&#039;m actually a fighter / power player, but more along the lines of realizing how much farther I have to go to truly hone my skills.
I think your example of how a players who are a few stones stronger can often blow away our strongest skills with their weakest is spot on. I definitely have to be careful of letting that mess with my self-perception that for sure.
However, at the end of the day, I know that both you and I are aiming to leave behind the kyu world in the near future (in fact, I wouldn&#039;t be surprised if both you and I have a similar goal to attend Go Congress as dans =D). So it&#039;s been a great reality check as to what I need to do to get there. =)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I dunno how strongly you should take this &quot;I found out I can&#039;t attack properly&quot; thing. Attacking skill is on a spectrum, and it involves a number of different parts. Maybe you ARE a fighter / power player, but you found someone whose defense is much stronger than your attack. That&#039;s gonna happen - go more than a few stones above me in strength, and most players&#039; weakest skills are going to blow apart my strongest.
It might be good to have your confidence checked so that you invest energy in honing your ability, but I would caution you against letting it alter your self-perception too much.]]></description>
