		<description><![CDATA[Thanks a lot for the advice. This is just the kind of post I needed because I just lost a game on Pandanet-IGS and the game has been bugging me all week. Also, I like the part about how we make mistakes. &quot;We make mis­takes. We fall. We get back up. We learn. We grow. We get stronger. And the cycle goes on and on…&quot; I&#039;m going to give this advice to the people in my go club. Thanks again for the advice!]]></description>
