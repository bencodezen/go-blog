		<description><![CDATA[Thanks! I&#039;ll be sure to try and capture as much of the trip as humanly possible. And if you&#039;re thinking about trying to learn Chinese again, I&#039;d recommend eChineseLearning. I&#039;ve been with them a few months now and have found it worthwhile. Talk to you when I get back!]]></description>

Hope you have a great time, and I&#039;m looking forward to both Go anecdotes and pictures of Hong Kong delicacies when you get back.:)  Makes me want to take another run at learning Chinese, just to have an excuse for a trip to that part of the planet!  Maybe someday.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Glad to hear it! I will definitely make a trip out to the go association. I think I&#039;ll probably call them when I get to Hong Kong. Haha. And I do know Chinese! But I&#039;m pretty sure they speak Cantonese, which makes my Chinese useless. xD]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hong Kong is great! Hope you have a good time :). Definitely check out the go association, super nice people there, though you might want to contact them before since I don&#039;t think there is always someone there. (And I don&#039;t know if you know Chinese, but that will definitely help, haha.)]]></description>
