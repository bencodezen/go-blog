		<description><![CDATA[The best approach that I&#039;ve found to overcome losing streaks is to play less, but not stop for a break entirely. I find that setting aside at least an hour to really focus on playing just one game per day works best. Golden rule: no blitzing during slumps]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Your quote has certainly made me stop and realize that perhaps I am that person who is chasing the butterfly all over the yard and trying to catch it. Each time I think I&#039;ve caught it ends up in frustration and disappointment. Perhaps it&#039;s time for me to simply work in the garden and let it come to me.
Thank you for your words of support and helping shed light on my problem. I have a feeling it&#039;s going to help alleviate the frustration I&#039;ve been feeling lately.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s funny you should mention that because that&#039;s probably one of the reasons for me consistent losses recently. I&#039;ve been doing a lot of different things and playing in sort of an atypical fashion, so that is probably partially the issue. Hopefully it&#039;ll expand my understanding as you mentioned. One can only hope!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Try completely changing styles.  If you&#039;re big into fighting, start trying to build moyos peacefully, or vice versa.  If you usually pincer, extend away from the approach.  Decide which direction play is going in and, instead of playing in that direction, interrupt your opponent&#039;s direction, or do it the other way around.
Then you can&#039;t expect to win for a while ... but you can expect to expand your understanding.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Reading the last few posts made me think of something a friend told me once (not sure where it comes from).   &quot;You can chase a butterfly all over the yard and never catch it.  But if you go quietly to work in the garden it will come and sit on your shoulder.&quot;   And this one.  &quot;Butterflies are self propelled flowers.&quot;  ~R.H. Heinlein
Just wanna  also say I appreciate your go, instructive content, and everything else you share with us!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The problem is losing most of my games in addition to having a very battered mentality.
I think that the enjoyment of the game is hidden all in my mass of confusion and frustration, so it&#039;s not as if I hate playing the game. Instead, it&#039;s more of I get frustrated at playing poorly or not being able to keep consistent till the end.
It&#039;s true that I wrote things like &quot;it&#039;s just a game,&quot; but I will have to say that go has become more of that to me because I really treat the game as a reflection of myself. So the havoc and instability I see on the board is a reflection of my mind.
Does that clear things up a bit?]]></description>
