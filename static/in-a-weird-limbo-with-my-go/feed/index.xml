		<description><![CDATA[I think your comment got cut off short. Haha. But I think you bring up an excellent point. Playing against friends or people who consistently watch my progress are a much better measure than against strangers.
And to your point about creating new accounts, I considered it in the past; but I found that keeping my games on the same username was the best for readers trying to find me and see how I&#039;m doing. =) Luckily I&#039;m not as obsessed with online rank as I used to be, otherwise this would have become a problem long ago. Haha.
I will be sure to keep this in mind as I am working through limbo. Thanks for your advice!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I think it can at times be very difficult to estimate your own progress, especially if you play often against random strangers. If you have friends, some of whom are stronger and some of them weaker, you can easier see if you&#039;re getting stronger, for example if you suddenly win two serious games in a row against a stronger friend you play regularly and have to adjust to a lower handicap in the next game, or maybe even if you win against a weaker friend more often so you have to give him one or two stones more or in even games. So what I am saying, maybe you&#039;re getting stronger, but you haven&#039;t realized yet? Online rating systems aren&#039;t perfect, often it can take a while to adjust and sometimes it is then better to make a new account with a new rank instead of waiting for your visible rank to catch up, especially to avoid bad habits if you&#039;re already stronger than your equally ranked oponnents. Of course the best would be a strong teacher who follows your games and can easily estimate your progress, but I think playing regularly with Friends who have]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks for the advice Todd! I think part of it is that I&#039;m not actually to worried about my strength anymore. It&#039;s kind of an odd feeling. Instead it&#039;s more like I&#039;m unsure of how to grow next. But regardless, you&#039;re right in that I just need to keep at it. I&#039;m sure it will make sense in due time. =)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Maybe you&#039;ve hit a plateau.  It happens!  It just means that you keep around the same strength while coming to understand different facets of the game you might not have connected with before.  Like, you studied the hell out of tesuji but have yet to actually learn to apply it to semai in actual play.  Or you studied life and death but didn&#039;t realise fully that you need to form shapes with your stones inside enemy territory.
Those were sources of plateau for me at my level of the game, along with a bunch of other stuff that I&#039;ve learned more about over the last year through actual experience.  After a year, I&#039;m finally gaining strength again, but it was necessary to consolidate my strength before continuing to improve.  Which I didn&#039;t fully realise was happening until I had already almost finished consolidating my strength; it felt just like you said: &quot;It&#039;s not helping/I don&#039;t know what else to try/should I keep bothering since I&#039;m not improving&quot;.
Keep at it, and keep trying to understand your game better all the time; keep an open flexible mind, and you&#039;ll get past the plateau and head further up the mountain.  How can you expect to climb higher until you slog across the plateau?:)
