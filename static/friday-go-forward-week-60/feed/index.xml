		<description><![CDATA[The reason I&#039;m doing Korean servers instead of KGS is because the style of play on KGS has become a bit monotonous for me as of late. You can always expect a similar style of play whenever you get a game. Korean servers provide a completely different cast of players that will force you to really rethink the way you approach the game if you&#039;re used to KGS games (which I realized I desperately needed after the last tournament).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Yeah it really sucks that neither Tygem or WBaduk is Mac friendly. I mean the iPad apps are okay, but I don&#039;t really care for playing on a tablet since it&#039;s hard to get records off and misclicks are a lot easier. Hopefully they fix that in the near future!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I think this is a very good decission man! For me its the same, but as being a mac user i can tell you, it is not very easy and comfortable like kgs... both have html client , but the tygem one seems to ve not working (?!) any more... the wbaduk client works, but you definetly can&#039;t save kifu!!!! But maybe it is good training replay them or record them just after the game. I use vmware fusion for running the clients on windows.. but it slows down my mac enorm! So i can&#039;t &quot;just play a quick wbaduk game&quot; if i want to save the kifu.... and i can&#039;t chat or comunicate much with anybody.... but the games are strong and nice and i will, like you, more and more move to tygem&#038;wbaduk nevertheless.
Ps: i have i ipad and both have ipad apps... but the tygem can&#039;t export ir save kifu in any way and no chat at all! The wbaduk app saves kifu but can&#039;t export. ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Well, I hope I&#039;m not the first to admit that about 75% of my studying go is tesuji, life and death, etc. so this helps.  Thanks a lot :)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I had multiple ones for Tygem at one point, but I&#039;m using &quot;bengozen&quot; on both servers now. (Fair warning, they haven&#039;t been played on in a while so the rank is pretty low).
The most significant thing that he told me was to play games more often. About 50% of my studying of go should be playing. There were other tidbits, but that&#039;s the main thing.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Sounds cool Ben. What usernames do you play by on WBaduk and Tygem?
Also, what did Myung (9p) tell you to change? I&#039;ve been doing pretty much what you have been doing so I would love to change my training regimen if you change yours :)]]></description>
