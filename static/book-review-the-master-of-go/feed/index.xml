		<description><![CDATA[Well, not really ... ;-)
But, as you want to make a living out of go and you are very good in writing in a journalist style it might be a good idea to also consider other options than becoming pro. Maybe you&#039;re more another John Fairrbairn than another Go Seigen? Just a thought ... :-) ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I think you bring up an excellent point. In many ways, comparing the two books is like comparing apples and oranges. To clarify though (which I will probably go back into the review to fix), it&#039;s not that I thought the book was bad by any means. It&#039;s just that I went into it with a slightly different expectation since I read First Kyu before. But yes, there&#039;s definitely a reason why it won a Nobel prize. =D]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[IMHO what is important to know / notice is that &quot;Master of Go&quot; is not really about go, but &quot;First Kyu&quot; is. In Master of Go the game is a methapor for the clash of old and new Japan in a time where the nation just has started the most suicidal war in the history of mankind but nobody wanted to hear about it. Insted they played incredible slow go in spas ... First Kyu has a completly different focus, it&#039;s really hard to compare them at all. But one thing for those who disregard &quot;Master of Go&quot;: There will never be a Nobel prize for &quot;First Kyu&quot; - that&#039;s for sure. But Kawabata got one for Master of Go (and other books), so maybe it&#039;s just not that bad ... ;-)
And last but not least my personal feelings about the books: I love them both! :-)]]></description>
