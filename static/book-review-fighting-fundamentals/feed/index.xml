		<description><![CDATA[Absolutely. Pick a first-shot typeface (a nice, solid gothic one with decent heft) and type the title. Adjust the size several times until we find a pleasing ratio between the size of the letters and the margins that also feels neither too heavy nor too light, visually speaking, in balance with the graphic at the bottom. Nudge it to exactly the right spot where distance from the upper left corner of the first F to the size equals the distance to the top. Pick a color for it -- grab several colors using the eyedropper from the graphic. Then add the author name - decrease the size a bit, then place it beneath the title. Hmmm, too much space between the lines. Decrease the line-height of the title, then bump the author&#039;s name closer to exactly equal that distance. Perfect. Now change the color of the author&#039;s name... none of the other colors from the graphic really look great, so let&#039;s try a darker version of the color we chose for the title. Nice.
Now let&#039;s briefly try all of that with another typeface -- ehhhhh, it&#039;s just for a blog comment, and the first typeface looks good. That&#039;s a wrap!
Hell, yeah, that took five minutes. Anything less and you&#039;re not paying attention, or you&#039;re very clear on what you want before you start, in which case you&#039;ve just front-loaded some of the work.]]></description>
