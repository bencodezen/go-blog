		<description><![CDATA[Interesting! I have tried studying more amateur dan games at one point, but then someone pointed out to me that the commentary on them can differ greatly, so I thought I&#039;d switch it up for a bit. Thanks for the advice!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks for your support Rob. It&#039;s been rather tough lately, but word of encouragement like yours are helpful in picking myself back up. I&#039;m hoping all is well with you and that I will be able to see you at a tournament soon! Let me know whenever you plan on going to another one!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Great idea! I just need to find time to play actual games where I can think like that. Haha. Usually 10 minute games don&#039;t allow for too much reading ahead or counting territory, but it&#039;s definitely a great idea. Thanks for the advice!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Yeah. The detachment part has been difficult. Hopefully I can fix it sooner rather than later though. It&#039;s been rather painful seeing the way I play lately. Haha.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve heard it suggested before that bad shape and mistakes should invoke a sense of revulsion in you. That they should look ugly, like rotten food. Then Go has rooted itself deep into the primal learning center of your brain.
So being nervous isn&#039;t quite the right emotion, but you&#039;re close to a good one. A little more detachment, but the strong reaction itself isn&#039;t bad. I think that&#039;s one of the benefits of studying pro games, in fact: Whenever you react with a strong, negative emotion to a position you&#039;re probably looking at an error in your judgement you can now begin to mend.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I would suggest cutting down on the studying but instead playing games with a specific goal in mind, which isn&#039;t &quot;winning the game&quot;. More like: This game I&quot;ll try to think before each move if I&#039;m playing the biggest move. Or I&quot;ll read at least 5 moves ahead, or &quot;whenever I&#039;ts not my move I&#039;ll start counting territory&quot;. This way instead of learning technique you&#039;ll learn better game mentality. Just a thought, it&#039;s what I&#039;m trying to do at the moment and it&#039;s fun.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I just last night carefully reviewed) a 13-kyu game you posted only a week ago.  Because I deleted it I can&#039;t perfectly quote one of your comments, but basically you said upon noticing the white player had all of 3-stones in the top left corner, how to you to your 13-kyu self no so very long ago, &quot;the corner is now lost&quot;.  Of course it wasn&#039;t lost at all but to you back then it looked fairly impenetrable so you convinced yourself it was lost. Later in the game you beat the guy up pretty good in that corner but at first blush you felt it was all over for you in that corner.  Same person still playing the game, albeit playing much better nowadays, so no surprise you feel the same way still when you are looking at somebody else&#039;s pro game. I believe you haven&#039;t changed at all - you are still the same guy, but now much more capable on the board when faced with complex options and conflicts during a game.  Frankly I think you need to cut yourself a little slack and absolutely do study professional games not to get better but rather to enjoy them more. Getting better will be a natural consequence. You&#039;re doing fine buddy don&#039;t beat yourself up so much. Rob]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[No matter the position, or how it got there, there are still good and bad moves to be played on the board. Spend time looking for the good one instead of worrying if previous ones were bad.
One early piece of advice that struck me was that I should study slow high level amateur games instead of professional ones.
The idea is that high level amateurs are masters of the basics, and most of their moves should be tactically and strategically sound and straightforward. Professionals however must absolutely squeeze every bit of usefulness that they can out of their stones. This results in very complex and hard to understand games. Pretty much only a pro could tell you why another pro may have played x sequence instead of y sequence.
I wish you luck with your game.]]></description>
