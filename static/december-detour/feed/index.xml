		<description><![CDATA[I most certainly have been working on these details. Sometimes I think that it&#039;s a matter of having concepts marinate and bloom under different conditions. You know? It&#039;s as if constantly trying to frame everything in a go-related context is actually not helpful, and something different like a video game can totally make everything click. =D]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Have also been thinking about other games recently.  There&#039;s so many interesting ones and it&#039;s fascinating to see the ripple affect they have on each other across the gaming world (Batt&#039;s recent adventures with Trump for example).
May sound a tad curious but it&#039;s my belief that working out our equilibrium with the game and how it best fits in our lives can only improve our experience with it even if this means stepping away for a awhile.  From your posts over the last few months or so I&#039;ve wondered if perhaps you might be working out these sorts of details.  Can say I&#039;ve been rooting for you all the way.
For me the synthesis of organic, aesthetic, strategic and tactical elements of go and the rich artistic properties it conceives as a whole are with out equal in the mind sport&#039;s universe.  Still, if was younger and had more time for gaming there&#039;s a good chance I&#039;d pursue some of these others.  :D]]></description>
