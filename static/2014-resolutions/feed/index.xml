		<description><![CDATA[AHHH IT BROKE AGAIN!!! I don&#039;t know why it&#039;s being so temperamental!!!! Have you ever heard of any problems with Wordpress CSS going in and out?! GAH! It usually fixes after a few refreshes though. Then again, might be another problem with my hosting service. BLEH!
And to answer your question, I think that the design is just not quite what I&#039;m looking for yet. In addition, I really should take pride in my ability to design and create a layout and visual UI that&#039;s of my own volition instead of relying on free templates. And in addition, I think that the overall blog&#039;s user experience could use some enhancements. (Maybe I&#039;m wrong?) So those are my reasons for the redesign. =)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[A redesign is well and good, but is there a reason you&#039;ve gone CSS-naked today? ;)
More seriously: the impulse to redesign is something I&#039;ve felt *so* many times, but it&#039;s almost always something that gets in the way of making actual content. Is there a specific problem you&#039;re trying to solve with your redesign, or do you just feel that your current design&#039;s not quite as awesome as you&#039;d like?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The templates are quite clean and simplistic. The only downside is that they make you run on their own technology (which is actually great for most customers since it removes a lot of the headache of coding and what not). Unfortunately for me though, that would be a show-stopper since I&#039;m utilizing a different platform (i.e., WordPress). Thanks for the suggestion though!]]></description>
