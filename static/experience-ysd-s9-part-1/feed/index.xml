		<description><![CDATA[Hey Steven. Absolutely. In short, the issue came down to money and time. While there is a lot of value for those able to study and spend the necessary time on the program and all its benefits, it became more of a chore for me and I just couldn&#039;t spend the time I want to on it. Does that help?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[i was hesitant about it too, but when you consider the quality of reviews you are getting along with the mass of lectures, I think it&#039;s actually a pretty fair price. And of course, as you might expect, if you are going to join, I&#039;d recommend just joining for the season since you&#039;ll save money and not to mention it&#039;s hard to tell if you had any results after a single month.
Let me know if you ever have any other questions!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hey Devin! So lectures are normally 3x a month on Mondays at 10PM EST. So it&#039;s not too bad in terms of interfering with most daily activities. And in terms of games, 4x of the games are on Thursdays at 9PM EST and 1x game is on the last Tuesday at 9PM EST.
Of course, if any of those times do not work however, then you may reschedule with your opponent to a separate time, but those are the pre-ordained slots to try to maintain some consistency in the dojang.
And yes there is an American program! That&#039;s the one I&#039;m doing in fact. (Maybe I should state that explicitly in the report.) Haha.
Does that help to clear things up?]]></description>
