		<description><![CDATA[Amen to that! The fact that you can look at your old games and see what you would have done differently is certainly a sign of improvement. Keep on moving forward!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Looking back on this game, I realize that if I were put in the position of choosing move 109 again, I would do F8 instead of F10. I remember wanting to try out a tesuji but after doing some pretty important life &#038; death, tesuji and endgame problems, I probably wouldn&#039;t have tried it at this point in the game. Goes to show how your reading improves when you practice Go problems, no matter how annoying/redundant they may seem :)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hello,
Thanks a lot for the review. I just realized how many chances you actually gave me to live but I neglected them. As I&#039;m looking at the game now, I was perfectly connected with a large knight&#039;s move but just got a little proud. We should play again sometime. Thanks again for the review.
Bye!]]></description>
