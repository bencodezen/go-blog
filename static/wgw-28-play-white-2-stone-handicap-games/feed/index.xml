		<description><![CDATA[There seem to be lots of different styles. Weird approaches to get people out of joseki. I tend to tenuki a lot, but I&#039;ve also seen people play very diligently in one area to keep expanding a small advantage into game winning advantage.
I like to approach adjacent corners and kill side handicap stones or pincer stones in between (or just form large side territory).
I saw a great 9 stone handicap game by a kgs 4th dan at the local club. The opponent wouldn&#039;t let him create a base, and he just patiently ran two giant dragons across the board. I thought he&#039;d lose by 100+, but in the end the opponent had stretched too thin and the 4 dan used all the aji left and broke into a couple big areas, winning by like 20 points. It was very informative how comfortable he was with no eyes: he never played small gote moves to live, but just kept the other player from solidifying territory and trusted he&#039;d find life eventually (or lose, but you can&#039;t stop that from happening in high handicaps ;)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The nice thing with two stones is you usually get the first approach move as white. If you happen to hold on to sente, you get to approach another stone. Three stones always feels a bit like parrying an attack and looking for an opening, two stones lets you start developing the board advantageously immediately.]]></description>
