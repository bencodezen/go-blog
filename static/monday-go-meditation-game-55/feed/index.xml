		<description><![CDATA[Very nice hunt, Ã¤h game :) near the end i would have been in worries as black because of the capturing race with the p10 group... but you managed it well, and you had a few more liberties from the beginning. So what about 111? Do you still think the wedge was good? ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi! It&#039;s so great to meet a Vietnamese player! My family is from Cho Long so I&#039;ve visited Vietnam many times in the past. So exciting to meet a fellow go player from Vietnam!
Well the decision to comment on every move was to try and make the games accessible to players of all levels (particularly more beginner ones). So hopefully that explains some of it. But I&#039;m glad it could get you smiling!
B13 - Yeah I have very little experience with this joseki. Hopefully I&#039;ll have a chance to study it more in the future.
B29 - You are absolutely right. I should have taken one of the bigger points since it&#039;s not as if my turn to seal White in threatened him in any way.
Thanks for the great advice! Hope to hear more of your comments in future game reviews!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi. :).
You&#039;re so &quot;cute&quot; to comment on every move of the game. It&#039;s really interesting. I can&#039;t help myself smiling.
I can&#039;t follow the whole game but I can review something in the openning.
First, B13 in the game not joseki. You must atari at C15 first. Think that you&#039;ve researched this joseki after this game. Somewhat complicate joseki.
B29 to seal White in is very big move. But there is many urgent move on the board. You can directly approach with D5 or L17 (I prefer this move).

Nice to read your blog.

		<description><![CDATA[The move I prefer to q6 is p2, the classic Chinese attacking move. It takes a big corner and denies a base to white&#039;s stone. It&#039;s weakness, of course, is the other side - r6. But in this case, you have a stone at q10 already, which means if white tries to play r6, you can separate the two groups, and then look forward to the pleasure of attacking them both.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Yes. That will come with time and experience. So don&#039;t sweat it, you&#039;ll be able to analyze things like this before you know it!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[yes, of course. I did not want to say,t hat white has lost the game with mistake in 2nd move :D but still, one has to really understand this deep enough and not to play those moves kind of automatically, but still be aware what is behind it, what are the consequences, advantages, disadvantages]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[To be clear though, this sort of &quot;mistake&quot; is one that doesn&#039;t really affect people&#039;s game until much later in their growth. Especially at the kyu level, these mistakes go practically unnoticed since we normally make mistakes much worse than something like this (which is a mistake in regards to direction of play and nothing else).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[yes, I think so. partially at least. interesting how even first or second move can have such great influence, when you play it improperly]]></description>
