		<description><![CDATA[I like the idea of playing more for territory than for influence myself, and I think this change in play style coupled with an increase in the frequency of your playing will be really helpful. I think, however, that it might be worth trying in a month or two to start trying to play thickly.  I heard somewhere that pros play thickly because through an abundance of strength on the board they&#039;ll be able to control the match.  Might be something worth trying.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I see this:
When you have an overÂ­whelmÂ­ing advanÂ­tage, donâ€™t become overÂ­conÂ­fiÂ­dent and give your oppoÂ­nent a chance to turn it around.
so for me still bit misleading.]]></description>
