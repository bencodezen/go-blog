		<description><![CDATA[Thanks Molokai! I&#039;ve been tinkering with the review over time, so glad to hear that the stream of consciousness is actually something that&#039;s working! Be sure to let me know as time goes on whether I&#039;m headed in the right direction as I try to keep improving the reviews. Thanks for your support!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This particular game-study was quite valuable to me, thanks! I really like not only the analysis but the move-by-move &#039;stream of consciousness&#039; as it were. In chess there is a great book titled &#039;Logical Chess&#039; (by Irving Chernev) which offers a comment every move. Also seeing the Go terms in context was helpful. Thanks again and hope next week is better for you!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Of course. It is absolutely essentially not to rely purely on statistics, but it&#039;s good to keep in mind when making decisions. That&#039;s all!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I never said bout not using it, just said about ur corner shimari move :D
I am 99% sure I was using D15 move years ago, when I was using that tool. I stoped it using after hearing from Guo Juan that I should just play not search stuff on web based on statystic, your own experience is way more important than what other plays, cause u are learning creativity, not just go play.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Just checked the game. It&#039;s a completely different fuseki though since Black has alternating 3-4 while in Gu Li&#039;s game he had a star point. I wouldn&#039;t say that&#039;s necessarily an argument for not using D15. Haha.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I don&#039;t think Oren was necessarily saying it&#039;s the right answer, but instead was using the statistics as a way of helping show that we need to be more open minded about what options we have on the board. That&#039;s all. Haha.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[well after today there is 21 games with that move:P Gu Li played it today with his game ;)
If u read more about D15 move its a move that you play when youre afraid of playing or didnt want to play against chinese fuseki, and usually u get princered with D12 that make true sword of muramasa(?) - book to read for that &quot;The chinese fuseki - Kato Masao&quot;
sorry but statistic lie, cause there is other kind of trends in go, so does theory of play change a little in fuseki, long time ago like 100 years it changed slower than in last 10 years, you can see a lot of difference in opening and so on]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I looked the opening up in a pro database.
For move 5...
D15 - 1300 Games
C15 - 700 Games
P17 - 600 Games
O17 - 300 Games
Play style definitely comes into play, but what I like about databases at time is it is a way to broaden your ideas to what strong players consider.
Maybe I took your comment &quot;I had two choices&quot; too literally, but it struck an odd chord when I read it, so I had to comment on that.
There are just 20 games with your move to give a comparison, but I think that&#039;s enough to say it&#039;s playable if unusual.  :)]]></description>
