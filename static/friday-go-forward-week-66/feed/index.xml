		<description><![CDATA[Thank you, afterbreak. I think in Go you can differentiate between &#039;hard reading/calculation&#039; and &#039;soft reading/calculation.&#039; The latter is basically the recognition of patterns - you can see several moves ahead without calculating much at all. It is hard reading/calculation that I am very weak - although perhaps its a little less important in Go than in chess predominantly tactical in nature. Hard reading/calculation is really the ability to visualize and keep track of analysis trees. I am going to try to translate some chess techniques for visualization to Go, see if any of them offer promise.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Well odnihs is actually the person who pointed out how my &quot;creativity&quot; was actually hurting my game. Haha. So his response is essentially what I&#039;m referring to in the lesson learned.
My creativity is often more of an instinctive / inspired by emotion type of moves. While this is good in some regard, because I have such weak fundamentals, this inspiration can only go so far. As a result, the moves are often &quot;stupid&quot; and &quot;mistakes.&quot;
Experimenting and creativity do seem to go hand in hand, but the key lies in exactly what odnihs mentions, &quot;Creativity needs to be backed up by skill if it is to actually mean anything.&quot; And that&#039;s what I&#039;m referring to.
Does that clear things up?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I think that&#039;s certainly where I make a lot of stupid moves since it&#039;s often a &quot;feel like it&quot; as opposed to calculated reading. Will definitely have to break that bad habit!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[In regards to OGS/DGS, those are servers that are used to playing with friends or anyone else wanting to play a game with me that do not have time to play on live servers. They are not used as servers for playing super serious games and improving.
Thanks for the detailed feedback! I will be sure to keep all that in mind as I start strategizing my content on the blog.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Reading is definitely a tough skill to improve as it&#039;s not as methodical as most would like. As afterbreak mentioned, problems seem to be the primary way for improving reading.
If I ever find a better way to train it, I&#039;ll let you know! Thanks for the feedback MolokaiCowboy!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[That really helps! I&#039;ve been partially worried that the blog has become more scripted, so I really appreciate you being so specific. I will definitely take this into consideration as I begin strategizing how I&#039;ll write content in the future. Thanks again!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Right, if your moves are backed up by some kind of calculated thinking and not just &quot;because you feel like it,&quot; then I think it&#039;s okay. Just as it doesn&#039;t mean you should randomly cut and invade everywhere, it also means you shouldn&#039;t just make wider extensions or play on the 4th line when you should be playing on the 3rd line unless you have practical reasoning behind it.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[You got point to some extent odnihs.
If by experimenting you cut all cuts of ur opponent without second tough then u are right, if u invade everywhere and try to live there just for the sake of invading yeh, same story, u got right. But if by experimenting You try different style of playing, or different kind of moves for ur play like usually u played on 3rd line but switching to 4th, or makin more wielder extension then that is good experimenting, it only depends how much tough and effort u put in that move. thats just opinion of mine]]></description>
