		<description><![CDATA[Hahaha. If I&#039;m even playing consistently at a high SDK level, I think I&#039;ll be happy. But no matter, I think you are right that this will give me much needed time to let my subconscious mind recover and digest what I&#039;ve been learning since my last break. Though if you ever need anything, still feel free to reach out!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[There is a chess story about a famous grandmaster, Akiba Rubinstein. It is said as a teen he was a decent amateur but no more. He disappeared from the chess scene for a few months - and came back a grandmaster!
So, Ben. I expect you to come back to BenGoZen at least 3d. :)
Seriously for whatever reasons I do think giving your subconscious mind time to digest what you&#039;ve learned is the best thing possible at this time.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks Molokai! When I make my debut back onto the blogging scene, I certainly hope to have a more efficient system in place that will allow for consistent blogging at a lower energy and time cost. After all, it&#039;s clear that there is value in what I do here; so I&#039;ll be back before you know it!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thank you Jeromie! It means a lot to see such support as I take this time to really inspect what I&#039;ve been doing in my life. It certainly is no reflection on go, but in fact even inspired from all that I&#039;ve learned from go in the need to maintain balance and keep watch of the whole board at all times.
I hope that you find peace on the board and on life as well. And since this isn&#039;t a break caused by burnout, I certainly hope to be back sooner rather than later! Till then!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks for your words of support Todd. It means a lot to know that my time up to this point has been spent well and appreciated by people like you.
I absolutely agree with you when it comes to heartfelt blogging vs regular blogging. After all, stilted writing is no fun for the writer or the reader!
 I certainly hope that we can see each other online in the near future. Until then, best of luck with your games and still free to reach out to me if you need anything!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I came late to the game here, but have derived much learning from BenGoZen, especially the Monday Meditation. I&#039;ll miss all of that but think you are making a sound decision, Ben. Best to you and thanks much!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thank you for all that you&#039;ve already given the go community through your blogging. I&#039;ve learned a lot through your insightful analysis, and I&#039;ve really enjoyed being invited into your journey to get stronger at go. I hope you&#039;re able to return to regularly blogging about go soon, but even if that particular adventure does not lie along your path know that I (and many) are thankful for what you&#039;ve already given us. In the meantime, I hope you find peace on the board and in your life.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks for letting everyone know you&#039;re okay.
Regular blogging isn&#039;t as important as heartfelt blogging.  At least I hope so, because I&#039;m not very good at being a regular blogger! For a long time, however, you have managed to make your posts both heartfelt and on a regular basis at the same time. Write again when you feel it in your heart; until then, I&#039;ll miss your posts, and I&#039;ll see you sometime on a server when we&#039;re both having fun with Go.]]></description>
