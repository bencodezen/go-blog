&quot;White
 descends solidly to prevent Black from getting the sente endgame play.
(To see what I mean, go back to Move 179 and click D13.&quot;
It is D12.
(Hawkeye ;)
and thanks for the answer about games 6,7,8. We&#039;re waiting for it!
Good luck!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thought there is a lot of aji on top, I would have to say that I personally feel like the center required attention at the time and he would have had to have faith in himself to fight it out on the top.
But then again, they were probably having a tough time dealing with the altitude on top of the intense match. So I&#039;m in no place to judge. Haha.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I would agree with Arthur that your theory sounds pretty plausible. They were both fighting with altitude sickness. And according to GoGameGuru, Gu Li was more affected by it than Lee Sedol. So that may have something to do with it as well.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m no pro but I think your theory seems sound. Seems like there&#039;s still some aji for the O18 group to work with. To me, it looks like the even bigger loss is if B gets L18, his H18 group suddenly looks a lot healthier (in sente too, because it threatens to connect to O18). Feels like W decided he cared more about the top side than the center at that moment, and didn&#039;t want B to just make eye shape so easily.
An Younggil&#039;s commentary suggests that M14 would have been better though so maybe the center was actually bigger...]]></description>
