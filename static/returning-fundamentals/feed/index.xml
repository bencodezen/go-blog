		<description><![CDATA[well, thats only half true with rank/rating wise =)
I can say only something similar to old japanase saying bout learining joseki. When you learn joseki, u became weaker 5 stones, but when You understand it You gain 6 stones :P so its like +1 in rank, but not sure how much of truth it is.
When I was weaker - I learned only some basic josekis, most peacefull ones, and thats it. At this point I can say, for us SDK and some low dans players learing them is a waste of time, study maybe ok, but doing life and death problems and tesuji ones too is more important, that way You learn most of josekis.]]></description>
