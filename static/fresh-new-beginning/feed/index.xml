		<description><![CDATA[Ben, I&#039;ve been playing go (not continuously, sure) for, like, 11 years already. I&#039;d love to be 6d and crushing it, but my life took other detours. I&#039;ll eventually improve, it takes a while.
Also: I used to write a lot in my blog (not about go, about other things) but eventually realised it was far better to write when I wanted to *really* write and &quot;do things&quot; instead of just writing. Writing is good, but it&#039;s not doing the stuff you write about, if you understand what I mean.
So, take it easy, you still have 8.5 years to catch me ;)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Haha. You&#039;re a funny one.
Oo! If you don&#039;t mind, I would love to get a copy of that when you&#039;re since it would be great to get an idea the level of efforts I need to put forth to have a comprehensive review of the go books on the blog!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I will write &quot;Shodan at Any Age&quot; and dedicate to the Master - BenGoZen!
I am compiling an updated Go Books in English...appears to be about 600 of them - compared to 15,000 or so on chess. :(]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Whoa! I never knew that book existed! You&#039;ll have to let me know what you think of it!
In terms of endgame, I think that Western literature is a bit lacking. Maybe you&#039;ll become an expert and write your own someday!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I have at least designed my first Learning Module. I will do visualization exercises with a PowerPoint I built, similar to one I used for chess. Also, I will be going through the Ishi Elementary book on Endgames (your are correct, Chapter One is fierce!) and the Basic Endgame tutorial on Sensei&#039;s.
 I also bought Mathematical Go Endgames but its mostly a math book, not really what I seek - some basic local situation Go &#039;algorithms.&#039;]]></description>
