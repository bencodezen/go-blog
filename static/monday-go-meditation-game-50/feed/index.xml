		<description><![CDATA[As someone who has been trying to learn from the whole board school of thought, I definitely have a great appreciation for Go Seigen&#039;s view on that. Giving my opponent choices (that are not on my terms) is particularly rough.
I&#039;ll be sure to keep working on my ladder abilities though. They are clearly lacking as illustrated in my recent games. Haha.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This marks today&#039;s daily nod to the incredible utility of &quot;Lessons in the Fundamentals of Go&quot;.
I&#039;m glad you sympathize about the difficulty of reading ladders accurately. In a way, it&#039;s nice: it&#039;s a place where you can really feel the mental difficulty of reading, but it&#039;s very easy to do it correctly if you just put in the work.
Regarding the small knight&#039;s dive (good term), it&#039;s obviously not a bad move locally, but whenever you&#039;re dealing with the whole board, you&#039;ve got other considerations. And Go Seigen, whole board specialist, probably didn&#039;t like moves that gave flexibility to his opponent.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks Tomer! Ah yes! Well just so you know, I usually have to review these games in advance due to how time consistent they can be. In addition, this game was played back on March 7th, so I&#039;m still good for April! Haha. In fact, those games will probably show up in May based on the schedule I have going for MGM at the moment. Thanks for the reminder though! I will make sure to follow through on that and keep you all updated!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Agreed. It was definitely one of those sloppy decisions that he ultimately paid the price for. And one should definitely not call that &quot;reading,&quot; but instead a gamble on it being entirely in his favor or in yours. (I don&#039;t know about you, but I find that these kind of all or nothings are more common in blitz games).
I don&#039;t see how you&#039;re being arrogant! In fact, I was going to mention something about Kageyama&#039;s insistence on reading ladders and how necessary it is. Even with myself, I played a game this morning where I had to check the ladder like five times before trying to play it out. (It was actually quite similar to the situation in your game). Definitely still requires effort from my end to really read ladders out (and even then I still feel only 80-90% sure of myself).
It never occurred to me that it was a &quot;bad move,&quot; but in today&#039;s meta-game where it&#039;s all about taking the initiative, I can completely see the flaw in the small knight&#039;s dive now. The flexibility it offers the opponent is too great of an advantage.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[You&#039;re right: it looks like a misreading, not a total failure to read. Though maybe calling it a misreading is still a little generous: they looked across the board, saw a stone of the right color, and figured it worked.
I don&#039;t want to be arrogant, here: following Kageyama&#039;s imperative to read ladders, not just speculate, isn&#039;t trivial for me, even now. My head hurts a little after following things all the way across the board, and the imaginary stones drift a little bit. And the moment my opponent continues the ladder, I have to check a second time, a third time, a fourth time, a fifth time, because I&#039;m not confident enough to just know for sure. But it&#039;s simple reading, even though you have to force your way through a headache due to the number of stones. And getting the ladder right is always worth it.
Thanks for the comment about the attachment. Shifu always says that Go Seigen didn&#039;t like this move (http://eidogo.com/#dpyv7PYp:0,59) because white has so many choices about how to respond. Sure, white could follow the joseki, but white could tenuki, attach, pincer... so many options!
