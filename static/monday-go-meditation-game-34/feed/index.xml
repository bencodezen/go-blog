		<description><![CDATA[Haha. I experienced that numerous times, so I completely empathize with the whole &quot;feeling cheated&quot; somehow. Such is what makes go so interesting though. Even though there are 99 ways to kill your opponent, if you happen to give them the 1 route to life, it can completely change the game. =D]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Brilliant! :-)
I remember one of my first games, &quot;after&quot; the game was played and all my territory was secure and I was clearly leading my opponent started to invade on the second line on the side. He created a number of false eyes but I didn&#039;t realise I could make them false permanently by throwing in a stone. I ended up loosing and wondering how I could have killed the invasion (and feeling cheated somehow!)]]></description>
