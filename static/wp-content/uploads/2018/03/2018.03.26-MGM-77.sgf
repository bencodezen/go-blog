;B[pd]C[Since it's been a while since I've played online, might as well start simple. Star point!]
;W[dp]C[Simple star point with no opportunity for a cross-fuseki, though I have to be honest in that I rarely choose a cross-fuseki as Black.]
;B[pq]C[As I'm easing into things, I'm sticking with openings I've last used most frequently, so this gives me the option of the Chinese opening if desired.]
;W[dd]C[Ninrensei. Two star points.]
;B[fq]C[Time to see what White's intentions are!]
;W[iq]LB[cn:A][cq:B]C[I rarely encounter the two space low pincer, but the options I considered were: A (C6) to switch directions since my Q3 stone was already in a position to minimize White's potential on the bottom, or B (C3) to simply dive into the corner.]
;B[cq]C[Due to the time limit, I chose to keep it simple and dive into the corner.]
;W[dq]C[White descends to block Black from connecting.]
;B[cp]C[Black extends to get a base.]
;W[do]LB[co:A]C[White extends because the hane at A (C5) would get White into trouble]
;B[dr]C[Black threatens to connect underneath.]
;W[er]C[White blocks.]
;B[cr]C[Black connects.]
;W[fr]LB[eq:A]C[And then White defends against the cut a little oddly with A (E3). Joseki would say to connect at A (E3) instead and I imagine this is due to the potential aji of the Black stone at F3. However, it seems White wanted to try and maintain a connection with the J3 stone. ]
;B[cn]C[Jumping one space is par for the course.]
;W[co]C[But then White pushes down immediately which seemed a little early.]
;B[bo]C[Black must block.]
;W[dn]C[White extends.]
;B[cm]C[I extend once to prevent myself from being flattened.]
;W[dm]LB[cl:A]C[White extends once more and has nice influence while I took some territory. 

Now to be honest, I strongly considered playing A (C8), but thought I should try and and take initiative somewhere else on the board since my group is safe.]
;B[fc]C[So an approach to probe White's intention was what I went with.]
;W[ic]C[He pincers yet again.]
;B[cf]C[I have no intention of just giving him another wall, so I try the double approach this time.]
;W[ch]C[Pincer again? Hmm....]
;B[cc]LB[ef:A]C[Seems like it's time to take the corner, but perhaps I should have considered a more influence oriented move like A (E14).]
;W[cd]C[White blocks on the left side now, which seems like a mistake because there isn't much potential here compared to the top.]
;B[dc]C[I happily take my base.]
;W[ed]C[White extends.]
;B[fd]C[I play this with the intention of separating White's stones, but this is just immature understanding of the joseki here.]
;W[ec]C[White threatens to cut.]
;B[eb]LB[db:A]C[Black blocks.

For the normal joseki, click on A (D18).]
(;W[gb]C[Then White deviates from the joseki with this, but Black is very happy with this response.]
;B[fb]C[Becuase now I can connect and I'm not sealed in per the joseki variation.]
;W[ef]C[So White takes the key point to strengthen White's E16 stones.]
;B[bd]C[I decide to hane under in order force White into a shape that has some aji later on in the endgame.]
;W[be]C[White must block to keep Black separated.]
;B[bc]C[Black connects.]
;W[ce]C[And White patches the cutting point.]
;B[cj]LB[qk:B][cl:A]C[This was an overplay on my part. I was aiming to take advantage of the aji at C14, but this is too soon. If I really wanted to continue the left side, I should have played A (C8). But the reality is I should have looked on the board and played something like B (R9) or something. That is by far the biggest point left on the board.]
;W[cl]C[Now White takes the key shape point. Ouch.]
;B[bl]C[No choice but to hane now.]
;W[bm]C[White cuts as expected.]
;B[bn]C[Connect.]
;W[bk]C[Second atari.]
;B[am]C[Necessary capture]
;W[ck]C[And now White has sealed Black in from the left side and White's stones are actually worked quite well together.]
;B[mq]LB[qk:A]C[At this point, I did briefly considered a big move like A (R9), but White's influence and center potential seemed like it was getting quite strong, so I chose a solid two space extension to prevent White from getting an easy approach while growing White's framework.]
;W[po]LB[pm:A]C[When White approaches here, I debate pincering at A (Q7), but wasn't quite sure how I'd follow up if White simply jumped into the center.]
;B[qo]C[So I opted for the attach in order to settle some territory since that seemed like the style I was playing this game anyhow.]
;W[qn]C[White hanes.]
;B[qp]C[So I pull back.]
;W[pn]C[White repairs the cutting point.]
;B[pj]LB[qj:A]C[So I decide to pincer and take the last major point, but it's worth noting that A (R10) would have been better since it actually undermines White's base. My original intention was to negate the influence of White's wall on the left.]
;W[lp]C[White is clearly trying to expand the framework.]
;B[no]TR[pn][qn][po]C[So I take this opportunity to attack the Q5 stones.]
;W[oq]C[White attaches since my two space extension left a weakness here.]
;B[or]C[Hane under to keep the connection.]
;W[pp]C[White threatens to cut and take the corner to settle.]
;B[qq]C[So I connect.]
;W[nq]C[White extends and threatens to cut.]
;B[nr]C[I extend to maintain my connection.]
;W[mp]LB[np:A]C[Now White is about to connect, and I do debate cutting at A (O4), but the variation I read out didn't seem favorable to me. Click O4 to see what I saw, but upon reviewing the variation, I should have just cut.]
(;B[lr]C[I opt to protect this cutting point, but this just goes to show my reading abilities are still quite rusty.]
;W[lq]C[White gets a free atari.]
;B[mr]C[I have to connect.]
;W[np]C[And now White is very solidly connected.]
;B[ge]C[I decided at this point to bring out my corner group into the center since White's framework was getting pretty scary. At the same time, this separates White's stones on the top and weakens them.]
;W[lc]C[White takes a two space extension.]
;B[nc]LB[jb:A]C[So I protect the corner while aiming for the attack at A (K18) to undermine the group's base.]
;W[qg]C[White now invades the left.]
;B[qe]C[So I protect the corner while attacking the stone.]
;W[og]LB[nj:A]C[When White jumps here, I'm well aware that my Q10 stone is under attack, but I can't see a good way to settle my stone (although I could have considered A (O10))]
;B[mf]C[So my goal is to still keep the top group under attack.]
;W[ni]C[White continues the attack on the Q10 stone.]
;B[mh]C[I jump once more in preparation of attack the top group while aiming at possible aji with the Q10 stone.]
;W[nh]C[White connects to prevent any push cut nonsense.]
;B[jb]C[Well time to follow through on my plan!]
;W[ib]LB[jc:A]C[White descends here which I thought was a little odd. Would have guessed A (K17) instead.]
;B[lb]C[I decide to connect under.]
;W[mc]C[White threatens to separate Black.]
;B[mb]C[So I connect my stones.]
;W[jc]C[White covers Black and threatens to make an eye.]
;B[kc]C[So I push through to create some cutting points in White's shape.]
;W[kd]C[Atari.]
;B[kb]C[Connect.]
;W[le]C[And now White protects the cutting point while threatening to separate my N14 stones.]
;B[me]C[So I reinforce my connection while keeping the group under attack.]
;W[lg]C[White peeps.]
;B[mg]C[So I connect.]
;W[kh]C[With this, it seems like White is in the clear.]
;B[li]C[So I play the diagonal to prevent myself from getting sealed in.]
;W[ki]C[White extends solid while expanding the center potential.]
;B[lj]C[I extend once more to prevent the seal while eyeing the Q10 stone.]
;W[ok]C[White sees through that and plays a move to keep the right side area protected.]
;B[je]LB[gg:A]C[So I play here in an effort to take the shape point and threaten to cut White apart, but the bigger move would have been A (G13) since it would wipe out so much of White's center potential.]
;W[if]LB[gg:A]C[Now White threatens to separate Black, and while I end up responding to it, I should have just still jumped at A (G13).]
;B[ie]C[So I pull back instinctively.]
;W[hf]C[White follows, and now the center is really starting to look like White's area.]
;B[lf]C[So I need to take some sort of compensation.]
;W[kf]C[White can try to connect.]
;B[ke]C[But now White's top group is pretty dead.]
;W[jf]C[White solidifies the connection to prevent Black from pushing through, but this is pretty small in relation to the rest of the board.]
;B[jl]C[This elephant's jump was kind of weird. I'm pretty sure it's an overplay on my part.]
;W[ik]C[But White luckily obliged my reduction.]
;B[kj]C[So I get to fix my overplay.]
;W[jj]C[White blocks.]
;B[il]C[This is another overplay becuase White could certainly cut if White wanted to and there's little Black can do about it.]
;W[hl]C[I get lucky again since White is in "protect my territory" mode]
;B[hm]C[I hane once more because while I'm aware I could be cut at this point, the cutting points White has exposed would allow me to make a fair amount of trouble if White tried to cut.]
;W[gl]C[White extends to further protect the center territory.]
;B[jk]C[So now I repair my connection and threaten the double atari.]
;W[ij]C[At this point, I'm feeling pretty good and think I should be able to win the game; but I'm losing based on KGS estimate.]
;B[rg]C[I decide to try and reduce the right side in sente.]
;W[rh]C[White blocks]
;B[rf]LB[ri:A]C[So I pull back aiming at some potential clamp tesuji.]
;W[qh]C[White wants nothing to do with that and connects solidly.]
;B[nm]C[So I continue reducing while aiming at the Q10 aji.]
;W[om]C[White blocks.]
;B[nk]C[Same plan.]
;W[oj]C[White extends solidly to squash the Q10 aji.]
;B[ol]C[I threaten to push through]
;W[pl]C[White blocks, and while I'm about to connect immediately, I'm thinking I should play a bigger move.]
;B[gm]C[So I think I can further reduce the center, but this is almost the game losing move.]
;W[im]C[Because now White can cut and I'm in trouble.]
;B[in]C[Time pressure ends up having me misclick the ladder variation, so I'm stuck now.]
;W[jm]C[White runs.]
;B[km]C[So I atari.]
;W[jn]C[Runs as expected]
;B[kn]C[No choice but to atari again and try to make the best of it]
;W[jo]C[White's out and safe now, but oh how painful this was. Now White has territory in that entire G5 area...]
;B[jr]C[So I try and reduce the bottom in sente because I know that I'm behind for sure]
;W[jq]C[White blocks.]
;B[ir]C[So I extend once to reduce again]
;W[hr]C[White can now safely lock, and I'm sobbing internally at the state of things.]
;B[ko]LB[jp:A]C[So I just try to reduce here again in sente by threatening the atari at A (K4)]
;W[kp]C[So White protects from that. And now it's a question of whether I can still make something work.]
;B[fg]C[This is the second misclick at this point that was born out of time pressure. Sigh.]
;W[ff]C[White chooses the correct variation.]
;B[gf]C[I can threaten to connect.]
;W[gg]C[But White keeps Black cut. So what else can I do now...]
;B[bf]LB[ae:A]C[Time to expose the aji I was aiming at earlier in the game...

But for those who are stronger, they'll see that this shouldn't work. Click A (A15) to see why.]
(;W[df]C[But luckily White is under time pressure too and can't spend time to read it out properly. This is White's losing move.]
;B[ae]C[So I get to connect under.]
;W[ad]C[White throws in for some reason...]
;B[ac]C[So I capture.]
;W[cg]C[White tries to seal the center and prevent further territory from being reduced.]
;B[ag]C[But I know shapes pretty well, and I have another trick up my sleeve.]
;W[bg]C[White ataris]
;B[bj]LB[ai:A][ak:B]C[But now I'm going to rescue this stone because now I have miai for connections]
;W[dj]C[So White tries to prevent me from reducing the center further.]
;B[di]LB[dk:A]C[But I can hane because of the weakness at A (D9)]
;W[ej]C[So White extends.]
;B[ci]C[And now I can connect]
;W[ah]C[White cuts off one of my connects.]
;B[ak]C[So I connect under]
;W[ei]C[Now White continues to try and seal me off]
;B[dh]C[Extend]
;W[eh]C[Block.]
;B[dg]C[Atari.]
;W[af]C[Capture.]
;B[eg]C[Now I save another stone!]
;W[fh]C[And then White seals me in here. ]
;B[rn]LB[aj:A]C[I end up going to find some endgame moves, but it's worth nothing that White could start a ko with the shape on the left now. Click on A (A10) to see the variation.]
(;W[rm]C[White blocks.]
;B[so]LB[sm:A]C[So I form the tiger's mouth with the aim of possibly starting a ko fight with A (T7)]
;W[sm]C[But White wants none of that.]
;B[sh]C[So time to reduce here in sente!]
;W[si]C[White blocks.]
;B[sg]C[Connect while threatening the cut]
;W[rj]C[Protects the cut]
;B[lh]C[Threaten the atari (which seems small) for some potential shenanigans.]
;W[kg]C[But again, White is defending solidly.]
;B[nl]LB[oe:A]C[I play here but it seems small now. I should have considered A (P15)]
;W[nd]C[Nice hane by White since it aims at a cutting weakness in my shape]
;B[oc]C[So I extend to also avoid any unnecessary capturing races]
;W[oe]LB[of:A]C[But now White gets this pretty nice connection. I make a mistake next, but the correction respond should be the wedge at A (P14).]
(;B[pf]LB[qf:A]C[This was played impulsively, but it's bad because of the sente push at A (R14).]
;W[of]C[White connects solidly.]
;B[md]C[And Black has to cut now to maintain the lead.]
;W[he]C[White threatens to save the top group]
;B[hd]C[So I block]
;W[fe]C[Atari.]
;B[gd]C[Connect.]
;W[mn]C[Nice reduction here by White since I can't cut off the stone]
;B[on]C[So I atari first to try an get something.]
;W[pm]C[Connects solidly]
;B[nn]C[So I connect as well.]
;W[kl]C[Then White plays this cutting sequence to end in sente]
;B[kk]C[Have to atari here.]
;W[ll]C[White extends]
;B[lm]C[And now Black turns to ensure the three stones don't get captured]
;W[mm]C[White threatens to connect]
;B[ml]C[So I have to block here to keep my four stones alive]
;W[ln]C[White gets the atari]
;B[lk]C[And Black captures in gote]
;W[sn]C[Atari]
;B[ro]C[Connect]
;W[kr]C[Threatens to capture two stones]
;B[ks]C[Atari under]
;W[kq]C[White connects the ko to threaten J2.]
;B[ls]C[So I connect]
;W[js]C[White throws in to get sente.]
;B[is]C[I capture.]
;W[hs]C[Decend to atari and protect the territory in sente.]
;B[js]C[Connect]
;W[rr]C[And now White is clearly just trying to see if Black will mess up. ]
;B[qr]C[I was 95% sure I didn't have to respond, but I wasn't about to lose the game over a mistake like that.]
;W[qf]C[White now gets this push.]
;B[re]C[I have to protet.]
;W[pe]C[And White gains 3 points. Sigh.]
;B[nj]C[This extension is to gain a point]
;W[oi]C[White protects the cut for fear of some tesuji that doesn't exist as far as I'm aware.]
;B[od]C[So I atari here to prevent any random cutting in sente]
;W[ne]C[White connects.]
;B[eo]C[This is my third misclick. **hangs head in shame**]
;W[eq]C[White thinks I'm up to something apparently]
;B[ai]C[I play here thinking I'll gain a point, but this is silly because the ko would allow White to completely turn the game around.]
;W[bh]C[Apparently White doesn't see it thankfully]
;B[al]C[So I fix up my weakness]
;W[bi]C[Atari]
;B[aj]C[And connect]
;W[qc]C[Now White is just grasping at straws]
;B[qd]C[Again, not going to let anything happen at this point because I'm pretty sure the game is close.]
;W[pb]C[Trying to make life]
;B[rc]C[Again, probably not necessary, but I don't have time to read it out]
;W[rb]C[Forms a potential eye]
;B[sb]C[Hane to make it a clean kill]
;W[ob]C[Threatens to cut]
;B[nb]C[Connect]
;W[qa]C[Makes an almost living shape]
;B[oa]C[And I could walk away but I really don't want any random capturing races to start at this point.]
;W[sa]C[Tries to start a ko]
;B[sc]C[But no thank you]
;W[ds]C[Reducing hane]
;B[cs]C[Block]
;W[es]C[Connect]
;B[oo]LB[mi:A]C[Destroys a point, but A (N11) would have been better]
;W[op]C[White connects]
;B[hg]C[I cut because I think maybe I see something..]
;W[gh]C[White connects]
;B[ji]C[I cut but I'm pretty sure there's nothing there]
;W[ii]C[Yep. Nothing there.]
;B[ad]C[So I connect the ko, but again, not the biggest thing on the board.]
;W[mi]C[White destroys a point.]
;B[mj]C[I protect a point.]
;W[ng]C[Dame]
;B[lo]C[Atari]
;W[mo]C[Connect]
;B[nf]C[Fill in dame]
;W[id]C[Grasping at straws again]
;B[ld]C[Clean capture.]
;W[da]C[Trying to induce a mistake]
;B[db]C[Connect solidly]
;W[ba]C[Clearly trying to start a capturing race]
;B[bb]C[Well unfortunately for White my life and death skills aren't that rusty]
;W[ca]C[White prevents the ko and stone crushing technique]
;B[ea]C[I could probably just live in seki, but I really just want to squash any notion that White has of my group potentially dying]
;W[jd]C[Atari]
;B[le]C[Connect]
;W[gc]C[White hoping for a miracle]
;B[aa]C[But I'm one liberty ahead]
;W[sd]C[White ataris as if it's a ko threat]
;B[rd]C[Just connect solidly]
;W[ab]C[And White thinks there's a ko for some reason]
;B[cb]C[But there's none]
;W[hc]C[Still hoping for a miracle]
;B[aa]C[And that settles that]
;W[el]C[White protects the cutting point, but there's nothing there]
;B[]C[So I pass]

Whew!])
(;B[of]C[Once Black wedges.]
;W[qf]C[White can threaten the cut first.]
;B[rd]C[Black will defend.]
;W[pe]C[White can try to connect.]
;B[ne]C[But now Black can threaten to cut.]
;W[pf]C[White should take this connection.]
;B[od]C[And now Black gains a couple extra points.]))
(;W[aj]C[White ataris here and Black has to respond]
;B[ai]C[So Black captures]
;W[bi]C[And now White can start a ko here since Black can't connect due to a shortage of liberties]))
(;W[ae]C[White can cut]
;B[ee]C[And Black can aim for this wedge]
;W[df]C[But this calm extension negates any shenanigans...]))
(;B[np]C[So I atari.]
;W[op]C[White connects and here I'm left thinking I have to take care of the both cutting stones.]
;B[nn]C[So I can try something like this]
;W[mr]C[But I was worried about this cut.]
;B[lq]C[However, if we play this out, we'll see that Black is fine.]
;W[lr]C[White can atari again.]
;B[kq]LB[kp:A][kr:B]C[But now Black has miai for safety.]))
(;W[db]C[So White is supposed to cut]
;B[cb]C[Black has to atari]
;W[fb]C[White cuts again]
;B[da]LB[gb:A]C[Black must capture. Now White could theoretically extend at A (G18), but click there for the variation to explain the issue.]
(;W[fe]C[But White is supposed to hane here to be consistent with the direction of play.]
;B[gb]C[Black will then atari the cutting stone.]
;W[gd]C[White will atari once.]
;B[fa]C[And now Black is sealed in and White gets influence.])
(;W[gb]C[So like this you might be thinking, "Oh, now Black is weak right?"

Well for one, Black is already alive in the corner. Worst thing White can do it reduce the territory.]
;B[fe]TR[ec][cd][dd][ed]SQ[fb][gb][ic]C[Once Black extends here, the marked group (E17) is now in trouble and the square group (F18) isn't settled yet either. Black may not have a base, but Black is out in the center and should have no problem living.])))
