;B[pd]C[Let's keep it simple with a star point.]
;W[op]C[Huh... already have a 5-4 opening by White which I'm not as familiar plaing again. ]
;B[dd]C[Since I have a feeling that the opening will be far from standard, I stick with ninrensei so I can focus more on White's corners and allow myself some comfort with the josekis in my corner.]
;W[eq]C[See? Not a standard opening at all...]
;B[cp]C[Ah well, time to approach!]
;W[dn]C[Apparently, this is the taisha joseki (which is one of the most complicated joseki). I have heard of it and glanced at it a few times in the past, but I honestly had no idea what to do from here.]
;B[ep]C[Since this was a Tygem match and I wanted to use my games on Tygem for experimenting and learning, I decided to look up what a proper sequence for the taisha would be. And it starts with this attachment here. 

My basic understanding is that since White played a large knight move, then Black's here is to keep White separated.]
;W[dp]LB[do:A][dq:B]C[White wedges to separate Black.

So now the question is, atari from A (D5) or B (D3)?]
;B[do]C[You must atari from this side in order to keep the fight going. Otherwise, White is going to end up with a favorable result.]
;W[dq]LB[co:A][eo:B]C[White connects. 

Next question, should you connect at A (C5) or B (E5)?]
(;B[co]C[Correct. You need to connect here in order to maintain the balance of this fight. If you connected on the outside, you would allow White to easily settle in the corner while relying on the ladder to stabilize the group. See the variation for what I mean.]
;W[eo]C[So White cuts here as anticipated. After all, this is a fight remember?]
;B[fp]C[There is a variation for ko, but this is the most popular variation from what I read. And to be honest, there's no ko at the beginning anyways, so I would have extended regardless.]
;W[fq]C[White extends her base and keeps Black's stones at two liberties.]
;B[cq]LB[gp:A]C[At this point, I would normally be tempted to extend at A (G4) in order to prevent White's atari, but this is the correct move since it maintains that balance in the corner. You'll see that both White and Black have similar formations which must be critical with complicated fights like this.]
;W[gp]LB[gq:A]C[White's atari here is actually a mistake as far as the joseki goes. White should simple extend at A (G3).]
;B[fo]C[I obviously run out and atari at the same time.]
;W[en]C[White must connect to keep the fight going on.

Now of course, where should Black play next?]
;B[gq]TR[fo][ep][fp]C[In this entire game, I'm the proudest of this single move. It seems scary to play since the marked group only has two liberties. But remember, this joseki is a fighting joseki, so complications are inherent in it. And my instincts and reading told me that I had a fighting chance, so I had to see it through with the cut!]
;W[hq]C[White ataris from the top.]
;B[gr]C[So I descend.]
;W[hp]TR[dp][dq][eq][fq]C[White protects the cutting point. 

Now the question to Black (which I read out when I cut), can Black capture the marked White group even though the F4 group only has two liberties?

Hint: You have three ladder variations to read out. I have added all three variations after the next move for you to read out if you can't see them all.]
;B[dr]LB[fn:A][go:B]C[My reading said I would be okay, but there were three ladders to consider before making this move.

See A and B for the ladder variations to read out.
]
(;W[pe]LB[gn:A]C[White is able to read it out as well and plays this ladder breaker. And I consider playing A (G6) as a response since trying to outread the ladder breaker would prove difficult for me since it was late and I knew I couldn't spend all my time on this fight.]
;B[fr]LB[gn:A][hr:B]C[I chose the more simple capture here since it takes away White's sente play at B (H2) which would better solidify White's bottom influence. However, part of me thinks that plays A (G6) may have been better since it would have keep White's group separated.]
;W[qd]C[Nonetheless, now the battle in the upper-right begins!]
;B[qc]LB[qe:A]C[I debated the crosscut at A (R15) before playing this hane, but I couldn't see a variation that would play out in my favor. So I wanted to simplify this position as much as possible since I knew that White still had weaknesses I could exploit in the lower left.]
;W[od]C[White ataris immediately.]
;B[pc]C[So I connect.]
;W[qe]C[White connects here as expected.]
;B[oc]LB[nc:A][rc:B]C[So I decide to extend solidly instead of the one point jump at A (O17) since I know that there could be potential shape problems if White gets B (S17) later on. In addition, this would keep my group very strong. 
]
;W[nd]LB[mc:A]C[White extends as expected.

I debate jumping to A (N17) to get ahead once again.]
;B[nc]LB[md:A]C[But I didn't like the shape I would get if White pushed through. Now granted, seeing this move now, perhaps I would have been okay with jumping. So it was probably a little irrational, but this shape is quite solid and threatens the follow up of A (N16).]
;W[md]LB[lc:A][qk:B]C[White extends to prevent me from hitting the other head of White's two stones.

Now at this point, the natural move should probably be A (M17). However, I'm feeling like White's thickness is pretty good and maybe I should be splitting the right side with a move like B (R9).

However, I also have the nagging feeling that White has weak groups that I can exploit.]
;B[gn]LB[dk:A][kp:B]C[So I choose this move instead to aim at either A (D9) or B (L4).]
;W[mc]C[White's turn here is painful since it seals my group in. However, my reading tells me that my group cannot be killed. And if I respond now, I will probably end in gote which is not what I wanted at all.]
;B[dk]C[So I ignore White and decide to attack instead.

Now upon reflection, I'm debating whether the bottom would have been better, but at the time, my thinking was any thickness I might get from this attack could be benefited by my upper left star point.]
;W[gm]LB[fm:A][hm:B]C[White attaches to make sabaki.

For a moment, I debate trying to cut immediately with A (F7), but the variations seemed to be in White's favor.

I debated B (H7) as well, but you can see the variation for why I didn't choose it.]
(;B[hn]LB[kp:A]C[So I just extended wanted to keep the shape simple since now I can aim at A (L4) too.]
;W[kp]C[Well looks like White saw that threat too.]
;B[hm]LB[el:B][gl:A][fm:C]C[So I turn expecting White to extend at A (G8), which I would follow up with B (E8) which would threaten the cut at C (F7).]
;W[el]LB[dl:A]C[White goes straight for the shape move. Should have thought of that...

I debate undercutting White with A (D8), but...]
;B[ek]C[I felt this would be better to harrass White while also starting to build up the upper right like I had originally planned.]
;W[gl]C[White now extends and has the shape I was trying to avoid anyways.]
;B[ik]LB[gj:A]C[So this is what I would call my first "mistake" in the game. The idea was that I would keep harrassing Whtie to build the left while gaining some influence in the center to make it easier for me to negate the potential moyo on the right.

However, I think this is the wrong direction. A (G10) would have been a more natural attack that absolutely would build the upper left.]
;W[dl]LB[gj:A][ck:B][fk:D][cl:C]C[I'm a little surprised that White does not jump at A (G10), but this makes sense since it starts to give White eye shape.

And for a while, I debate B (C9), C (C8), and D (F9).]
;B[fk]C[I decide to take away White's shape point, but again, I think I made another mistake here since I really should be undermining White's base so I can continue attacking it.]
;W[ck]C[Now White gets this hane.]
;B[cj]C[Which I have to block.]
;W[bk]C[White descends.]
;B[bj]C[I follow to at least get some sort of thickness for the upper left.]
;W[cm]C[And now White is very much alive.]
;B[bn]C[I decide to play this kosumi now since it would falsify an eye for White while also simultaneously expanding my corner territory. So a pretty big move.]
;W[bm]LB[gc:A][qk:B][qp:C]C[White of course responsd, but now White is very stable and one must question whether Black profited properly from this attack. And to be honest, I think my moves were too slack and this was too easy on White.

With this attack over now, the question becomes where to play next?

A (G17) - A move that would start to give the upper left framework some structure whlle negating the influence of the N17 group?

A (R9) - Splitting the right in order to prevent White from having the ideal formation?

C (R4) - Approach the corner and probe White's intentions?]
;B[qp]C[I decide to approach the corner since this felt like the biggest area and I have been leaving it completely uncontested at this point.]
;W[qq]LB[qo:A]C[I was surprised with White's attachment here since the outside attachment at A (R5) would work better with the thickness in the upper right.]
;B[rq]C[No matter. I hane to start forming a base.]
;W[pq]C[White pulls back to prevent the atari.]
;B[qm]C[I wasn't sure if this was joseki at the time, but it felt pretty safe to play here.]
;W[qk]C[White immediately approaches as expected.

My shape is a little thin...]
;B[om]LB[rk:A]C[So I decide to jump, but it's worth mentioning that I should have probably attached at A (S9) instead to better solidify my base. Because...]
;W[ro]C[Now White has this very nice invasion.]
;B[rp]C[I connect to prevent White from taking the corner.]
;W[qn]C[White's diagonal here is going to allow White to get out with good shape. I'm going to need to remember this technique...]
;B[pn]C[I hane to ensure all my stones are connected.]
;W[rm]C[White hanes and and is now safely connected to the R9 stone.]
;B[pp]LB[oq:A]C[So I further solidify my connection while threatening the cut at A (P3).]
;W[oq]C[White connects solidly.]
;B[oo]C[In hindight, I don't know this was necessary since my stones were connected, but I knew my group was weak since it did not have a base and I wanted to ensure my group didn't come under attack since they are still pretty far from their allies at H6.]
;W[ql]C[White ataris here, but I cannot save one stone only to end in gote.]
;B[mn]LB[mp:A]C[So I jump out looking to play at A (N4) and also start connecting back to my stones on the left.]
;W[nb]C[White now takes advantage of my tenuki from earlier.]
;B[ob]C[I block.]
;W[mb]C[White connects.]
;B[rd]C[I hane to expand my eye space.]
;W[re]C[White blocks.]
;B[rc]C[I connect since I'm pretty sure that White cannot kill me with my eye shape.]
;W[oa]C[White seems to disagree and hanes.]
;B[pa]C[I block.]
;W[na]LB[qa:A]C[White connects. And I'm left with another question of whether my group can live since the atari at A (R19) is something to look out for.]
;B[se]C[So I hane to expand my eye space.]
;W[sf]C[White blocks.]
;B[sd]C[And then I connect knowing that I'll get sente out of this and be alive regardless.]
;W[rf]C[White defends the cutting point, and I have sente!]
;B[gc]C[Now I get to play this big point to prevent White from getting an easy approach to the corner.]
;W[cd]C[White's attachment here is pretty slick. It probes Black's intentions and doesn't commit White in any particular way.]
;B[cc]C[They say use thickness for attacking, so I'll take the corner!]
;W[ce]LB[bc:A]C[I expected White to hane at A (B17), but this extension makes the probe now seem rather heavy.]
;B[bc]C[Once I take the key point, White's stones look a little out of place don't they?]
;W[de]C[White turns.]
;B[ed]LB[cg:A]C[I extend in order to further expand my corner territory, but i feel like a strong argument can be made for playing A (C13) instead which would really put pressure on White's group.]
;W[ff]C[White jumps out with the knight's move.]
;B[ee]C[This might be aji-keshi, but I had the intention of making White heavy as you'll see shortly.]
;W[ef]C[White pulls back to keep her stones connected.]
;B[dg]LB[cg:A]C[I peep here to make White heavy, but this move is questionable after you see the resulting sequence. I think in hindsight, I would have preferred to play A (C13).]
;W[df]C[White connects, and now looks very heavy right?]
;B[hf]LB[cg:A]C[I get ahead of myself and try to cap White at this point, but the better move would have been A (B13). Bad attack...]
;W[di]C[Ouch... I do not have a good response for this...]
;B[dj]C[Connecting solidly was all I could come up with since if I remember correctly, I was down to my last two byoyomi at this point.]
;W[cg]C[White's really starting to stabilize...]
;B[dh]C[This extension hits my own stones on the head, but I wanted to use this sequence to make some shape for my group as you'll see shortly.]
;W[ch]C[White extends as expected.]
;B[ei]C[So now I get this atari which repairs my shape a little.]
;W[eh]C[To my surprise, White counter-ataris.]
;B[ci]C[So I go ahead and capture.]
;W[eg]C[And White connects and ataris here.

Now there's no point in saving two stones at this point (especially because I will capture a stone in return as well). So they're worth maybe 2 points right now? Have to look for something bigger.]
;B[fh]C[My group is still weak and unlikely to survive and full blown attack if forced to make life, so I try to create some eye space while stretching out towards the center.]
;W[hg]C[White attaches.]
;B[ig]LB[hh:A]C[I decide to respond directly with the hane, but this move is questionable since H14 is not an important stone. Perhaps the clamp at A (H12) would have been better since it continues to help my group while responding to White's attachment.]
;W[gg]C[White pulls back.]
;B[ih]LB[hi:A]C[Again, I'm thinking too small here since I'm thinking I'll fence White in. I should have played a move like A (H11) instead to help run out my group.]
;W[gi]C[This jump gave me pause since I felt like my group was coming under attack and my time to analyze the situation was dwindling.]
;B[gk]LB[fi:A]C[I debated playing A (F11), but felt that White would constrain me and force me to live small, so I wanted to connect out into the center so I could focus my attention elsewhere.]
;W[bf]C[White makes guaranteed life with this move, so now I look to the biggest area on the board. Any thoughts where that is?]
;B[nh]C[This was the meeting point between both moyos is here, so this was a big point to get.]
;W[ph]C[White defends her right territory.]
;B[oj]LB[qj:A]C[I played here to further build out my center territory while threatening the attachment of A (R10).]
;W[ic]C[White ignored me though and extended up on top.]
;B[mp]LB[hb:A][ib:B]C[I decided to ignore and reduce White on the bottom instead. Though if I were to respond on top, I would have considered A (H18) and B (J18).]
;W[mq]C[White attaches.]
;B[lq]C[I hane here knowing that it will be sacrificed, but read out a sequence that would reduce White's territory in sente.]
;W[lp]C[White cuts.]
;B[nq]C[I can now atari here.]
;W[mr]C[White extends.]
;B[np]C[I connect to threaten the descent at O2.]
;W[nr]C[And then White blocks as expected.]
;B[js]C[This move was made a bit impulsively. If I remember correctly, I was in my final byoyomi count at this point.]
;W[jr]C[White hits my stone on the head.]
;B[hs]C[I jump back one space.]
;W[ks]C[White blocks.]
;B[is]C[And I connect, but I'm pretty sure that White does not have to respond to me which means I'm about to take gote.]
;W[kq]C[Fortunately White sees enough potential threat to still defend, so I get sente. Woot!]
;B[hl]C[This move here might seem slow, but I chose it because it was a solid move that would keep all my stones connected and strong.]
;W[qa]C[White turns her attention to trying to kill my group now. Hopefully my life and death skills are up to par...]
;B[ra]LB[pb:A][qb:B]C[I chose to go with this variation because connecting at A (Q17) instead would lead to either seki or ko (which I would almost certainly lose. And B (R18) would lead to a tough ko battle as well.]
;W[pb]C[White captures.]
;B[qb]C[Now I double-atari.]
;W[pa]C[White connects.]
;B[sb]C[And now I have three eyes and alive.

However, as far as everything is concerned, I'm pretty sure that overall my handling of this corner was pretty poor. As far as stone efficiency goes, I essentially played 13 stones for 3 points. No good.]
;W[fc]LB[ic:A]C[White's invasion here definitely calls into question my decision to ignore White's approach at A (J17) earlier.]
;B[fd]C[I block.]
;W[gb]C[But White has this easy hane for reducing my corner.]
;B[fb]C[I atari.]
;W[hc]LB[hb:A]C[White counter-ataris (which I believe is a mistake since it exposes the cut at A (H18). Instead, White should just pull back at A.]
;B[gd]C[I connect.]
;W[hb]C[White protects the cutting point.]
;B[qj]C[And so I tenuki because I think that this attachment will be severe.]
;W[qi]C[Except I forgot about the clamp variation.]
;B[pj]LB[pi:A]C[I could have made the tiger mouth at A (Q11), but I didn't like the shape I would get as a result of teh atari. ]
;W[rj]C[White blocks.]
;B[qr]LB[or:A]C[I'm running out of time and I'm trying to find sente plays. And from what I can tell, getting to atari at A (P2) would be a big win for Black.]
;W[or]C[White connects.]
;B[kn]LB[je:A][nf:B]C[I decide to prevent White from easily jumping into my moyo from the bottom, but honestly, I think that A (K15) or B (O14) would have been a better move.]
;W[eb]C[All my tenuki is starting to bite me in the butt...]
;B[ec]C[I can't descend, so I capture.]
;W[fa]C[Now White can connect under.]
;B[db]C[I atari, but I am losing a lot of territory that I originally sketched out. No good...]
;W[lh]LB[lj:A]C[White correctly ignores me to invade my moyo. The simplest move here would be to play A (M10).]
;B[mg]C[But I decide to try and attack White's stone instead. This is probably a mistake since the resulting sequence did not work out in my favor.]
;W[lg]C[White extends.]
;B[lf]C[I try to hane on top, but this won't work.]
;W[kf]LB[kg:A]C[White hanes as well and I realize I can't cut at A (L13) like I intended.]
;B[mf]C[So I connected.]
;W[jg]LB[lj:A]C[But White gets this great shape and I still have to worry about White's jump at A (M10). See what I mean by my attack being rather ineffective and a mistake?]
;B[ke]C[I hane to threaten the group...]
;W[je]C[But this only helps White make more shape.]
;B[le]LB[kc:B][jd:A]C[I connect to threaten A (K16) or the jump at B (L17).]
;W[jd]C[White connects with her stones.]
;B[mj]LB[ni:A][lj:B]C[This is debatable. I chose this move because I was afraid of the weakness at the connection of A (O11), but I really should have played B (L10) instead.]
;W[lj]C[Now White gets the attachment and my territory is just disappearing...]
;B[lk]C[I hane to prevent White from intruding anymore.]
;W[kk]LB[nj:B][mk:A]C[But White can hane as well, and threaten shenanigans with counter-atari at A (N9) and B (O10).]
;B[mk]C[So I connect.]
;W[kj]C[White connects.]
;B[kl]C[So I continue blocking even though my moyo has been decimated.]
;W[jl]C[White hanes here.]
;B[jk]C[And I think I can cut...]
;W[km]C[But White can atari...]
;B[ll]C[I have to connect.]
;W[jn]C[And on look, White is connected. Drats... ]
;B[lm]C[I descend toatari and better solidify my group, but alas, my groups are separated now. I'll have to be careful that I don't accidentally die.]
;W[jm]C[White connects.]
;B[io]C[I play the diagonal to threaten to cut off the group while also preventing White from turning this area into any significant amount of points.]
;W[jo]C[White extends to stay connected.]
;B[ip]TR[gp][hp][hq]C[I descend to threaten to capture the marked stones.]
;W[iq]C[White turns to save those stones.]
;B[og]LB[ea:B][ni:A]C[I'm a bit at a loss for what to do at this point and try to strengthen my connection at A (O11) while hopefully reducing White's territory in sente.

But this is a mistake, I should really have captured at B (E19). It seems small, but it means a whole lot as far as the group's stability goes and corner territory.]
;W[hj]C[Nice peep by White.]
;B[hk]C[I connect.]
;W[fc]C[And White is correct to ignore me and start this ko. My group is actually pretty weak and not quite alive yet. Oy vey...]
;B[fm]C[This ko threat was meant to threaten the entire White group...]
;W[fn]C[But I overlooked the atari which I have to respond to.]
;B[er]LB[go:A]C[I decide to capture directly, but this was a mistake. I should have connected at A (G5) instead.]
;W[if]C[White now cuts up my stones.]
;B[fb]C[I take the ko back in hopes of making solid life.]
;W[ea]C[But White just calmly connects.]
;B[da]C[I descend and atari.]
;W[ga]C[White connects, and now I need to find life with this shape...]
;B[bd]C[I turn once to expand my eye shape.]
;W[be]C[White blocks.]
;B[ba]C[And then I take the key point to make life. All in all, I did pretty abysmal in the two two corners. I really should have defended them much better.]
;W[go]C[White now cuts off my stones. Fantastic...]
;B[fl]TR[bk][ck][dl][el][bm][cm][dn][en][fn][eo]C[I have to capture now because my group is far from alive.The nice thing about this capture though is that it is sente since it threatens White's marked group.]
;W[em]C[White protects the second eye.]
;B[fi]TR[fh]C[White gives me a chance to save the marked stone while making a second eye for myself as well. 

Whew... no major groups dead yet... but I am sad that I failed to ultimately keep all my stones connected which I had worked on doing for most of the game.]
;W[ij]TR[ig][ih]C[White can now cut off the marked stones and make territory in the center...]
;B[jj]C[I push once to to reduce White's new territory.]
;W[ji]C[White blocks.]
;B[ki]C[And then I misread the upcoming double cut and end up giving up a few points in the resulting sequence.]
;W[li]C[White connects.]
;B[ii]LB[hi:A]TR[hj][ij]C[I atari here thinking I can capture White's marked stones with A (H11). ]
;W[jh]C[But I forget that Black will suffer from a shortage of liberty situation here.]
;B[gj]C[So I'm forced to atari here.]
;W[hi]C[White connects.]
;B[gh]C[And I have one more sente move to atari and threaten to connect.]
;W[hh]C[Which forces White to capture, but I'm pretty sure I lost a couple points in this misread.]
;B[pg]C[I now extend to reduce White's territory.]
;W[qg]C[White blocks.]
;B[he]C[I save my stone.]
;W[ol]C[Now White intrudes further on the little center territory I have left.]
;B[pm]TR[ol]C[I connect to threaten to separate the marked stone from its allies.]
;W[ok]C[White makes a nice bamboo joint.]
;B[pi]LB[ri:A][rk:B]C[Bad shape here, but I'm threatening the double cut at A (S11) and B (S9).]
;W[qh]C[White protects.]
;B[nl]C[So now I can hane and maintain the few points remaining here.]
;W[oh]LB[ni:A][nj:B][nk:C]C[White's push here threatens to expose the weakness of A (O11), B (O10), and C (O9).]
;B[ni]C[So I descend to prevent myself from losing any more points.]
;W[nk]LB[mi:B][oi:C][nj:A]C[White's turn here look inconspicuous, but it threatens the cut at A (O10) which would make B (N11) and C (P11) miai for cutting.]
;B[nj]C[So I have to protect yet again.]
;W[pl]LB[nm:A][no:B]C[This looks like a bad move for White, but it aims at the weakness of A (O7) and B (O5) later.]
;B[nn]LB[lo:A]C[I decide to protect directly against the weakness, but I think that A (M5) would have been the better defense in hindsight.]
;W[of]C[White expands his points a little bit with this tiger mouth.]
;B[kd]C[I threaten to do a lot of damage to White's top territory.]
;W[kc]C[White blocks.]
;B[ld]C[This was more of an impulsive move, but it's debatable whether White really needs to respond.]
;W[lc]C[Luckily White does, but again, not a good move on my part.]
;B[so]C[I'm happy to see this weakness here which is sente for me.]
;W[sn]C[White blocks.]
;B[sp]C[I connect. Can you see the weakness now?]
;W[rl]C[White sees it too and protects against the shortage of liberty situation.]
;B[qo]C[So I can atari in sente.]
;W[rn]C[And White connects.]
;B[bh]LB[am:A]C[I try to make some more points here, but A (A7) would have been better.]
;W[an]C[Now White gets to hane in sente.]
;B[ao]C[I block.]
;W[am]C[White connects.]
;B[jp]TR[jl][jm][km][jn][jo]C[I threaten to capture the marked group.]
;W[ko]C[White connects.]
;B[ln]C[I save my stone.]
;W[hd]TR[he][hf]C[White threatens to capture the marked stones.]
;B[ge]C[I connect.]
;W[nf]LB[oe:A]TR[og][pg]C[White threatens to cut off the marked stones while gaining at least one point at A (P15).]
;B[ng]C[I connect.]
;W[cn]C[White ataris.]
;B[bo]C[I connect.]
;W[bg]C[White solidifies her eye.]
;B[ps]C[I play the diagonal to threaten to reduce White's territory.]
;W[os]LB[rr:A][ns:B]C[White blocks. Now I debate the tenuki, but the cutting point at A (S2) is a big issue for me.

Click B (O1) to see the variation for why it's a problem.]

;W[al]C[White blocks.]
;B[ai]LB[ah:B][aj:A]C[I set up a ko shape since simply connecting at A (A10) would induce an atari by White B (A12) that would leave me in gote anyways.]
;W[ag]C[White descends to prevent me from easily gaining a point here.]
;B[ae]C[I destroy White's potential for a point here while also preventing any sente eye reducting move White might want to use later against the corner.]

I was a little sad to see that I was 5.5 points behind, but to be honest, I was actually happy that the game was that close. Perhaps my skills are not as rusty anymore!])

;W[sr]LB[sq:A]C[But when White descends here, Black also has no responds since Black suffers from a shortage of liberty situation and cannot atari at A (T3) without putting the whole group in self-atari.])))
(;B[hm]C[So I hane.]
;W[gl]LB[hn:A]C[White would extend, but now I have the cutting point of A (H6) to deal with. Don't forget that White has a growing moyo on the right I haven't dealt with it.]

(;B[eo]C[So you connect here.]
;W[co]C[White will cut here.]
;B[cn]C[You can certainly atari.]
;W[bo]C[White will descent]
;B[bn]C[You'll descent once.]
;W[bp]C[White will have to turn.]
;B[dm]C[And now you can capture this stone because you have the ladder, but this is inferior in my eyes since White is fully stable with a decent amount of corner territory while Black has at best a bit of thickness that is contingent on the D6 stone being captured (which gives White the opportunity to play ladder breakers later).]))
