		<description><![CDATA[I like IGS well enough. In particular, I love the fact that it actually works well on a Mac. I&#039;ve played maybe 10 games or so on it and have enjoyed the experience so far.
Yes. Ranking takes forever. I don&#039;t even know how the ranking system works in fact. I&#039;ve been 4k? for so long. And then there are ranks like 4k+. The ranking system just bewilders me. But yeah, it&#039;s fun if you need a quick opponent.
Hope to see you on there sometime!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I agree. They seem rather harsh at times, but my goal is to get stronger and not be told that &quot;I&#039;m so strong&quot; or whatever. Hopefully you can participate in YSD in the future as well! I think you would really enjoy it.]]></description>
