		<description><![CDATA[Hey Martin! Glad to hear that I&#039;m doing something right! Haha.
In regards to the sequence you proposed, White would capture and gain one eye. Then Black would have to connect at L14 to remove the second eye, but then White would get a ko with O18 / connect under. And I&#039;m not sure Black would have won that ko. Haha. So many threats on the board.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Ben! Nice game, I really like your commentaries on the games you post. One thing, I think you could have sorted out the connection of W100 and killed the dragon if you connected at P17 con B103 and saved the L15 stone with L14. The dragon would have only one eye after the sacrifice.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks! This fourth one hopefully won&#039;t be as time consuming as others, but I&#039;ll do my best to keep it up. Who knows, maybe eventually I&#039;ll have a post EVERY day. xD (Although more likely just every weekday, instead of the weekend as well. Haha).]]></description>
