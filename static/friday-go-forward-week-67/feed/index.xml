		<description><![CDATA[don&#039;t give up on ur plan of gettin stronger, every way is good if u enjoy it
just doing normal tesuji problems and life and death is a lot, just getting endgame tesuji part is pretty much hard, but it help you learn some shapes to make conection a bit easier from the point of ur groups, and its rather amazing thing.
there is a lot stronger ppl with reading that got weak opening but their middle game and endgame is superior for example Lee Sedol, on contrary  Gu Li is great at opening, and his middle game is great, but his endgame still is weak, thats why hi looses some of games currently.
Everyone got its own way of getting stronger, every way is different, and better than none.
Did you know that last minutes of life Fujisawa Shuko was great message for all Go players?
&quot;Make herculian effort&quot;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Not at all! The beautiful thing about go is that players of all strengths see the game from their own perspective. I look forward to your progress as a player and hope to continue hearing from you as you discover your own path! Best of luck and let me know if there&#039;s ever anything I can do to help!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I am a very weak Go player, so your expertise trumps on this subject, Ben.
But I am going to plot a little different path to improve, call on some conclusions I reached becoming at least a decent chess player. If one could become a dan player by just reading books and doing tesuji and life-death problems, we&#039;d all be there by now. :)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Huh... Perhaps this is similar to life and death problems where the games don&#039;t always come to that but it builds a basic reading pattern / library / paradigm as you mentioned. Thank you for starting this topic of discussion! Clearly it is an area rich with ideas and new perspectives.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Fascinating. I never thought of endgame that way. I definitely have a huge interest in getting very good at it, but currently am way too vested in other skills before getting to that. Not to mention there aren&#039;t that many books on endgame in English. Haha. Thanks for your input man.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I don&#039;t think whether you actually reach a lot of endgames or not is the issue. Same in chess - most amateur games don&#039;t get that far. But the point is (at least in chess) the endgame distills the core skills in portions manageable to amateurs. It helps build a solid&#039; thinking&#039; paradigm. When I taught chess, no one played a game until they mastered some basic endgames.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I actually think that afterbreak is right about the endgame being the hardest part of go to study; mostly because it involves very detailed counting/reading and the ability to be able to split moves into very small fractions of points.
Endgame is also a big asset for kyu players to study.  If their endgame is so bad that they can lose dozens of points because of it, they should work to fix their biggest weakness.  I remember reading a few years ago that the average go game lasts for about 240 moves, with the endgame taking up the vast majority of those moves (middlegame is usually over before move 100).  Something that lasts for such a long portion of the average game is undoubtedly worth studying in my opinion.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I would disagree in that it&#039;s not necessarily the most difficult part of go. In actuality, from what I&#039;ve heard, it&#039;s actually the easiest part of go to improve at (from an amateur perspective) because there are only so many variations.
More often than not, kyu players make the huge mistakes in the middle game and not during endgame. I know that endgame is a huge asset to a player if he/she can use it well, but I would practically never recommend it as a serious topic of study for any kyu player that still has a ways to go before reaching dan.
And don&#039;t forget, for endgame to be worth something, you have to make sure you don&#039;t make any big mistakes in the 200 or so moves it takes to get to the endgame. Otherwise no amount of endgame can reverse those mistakes.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Ben You forgot one thing, the most annoying and difficult part of go is exactly endgame.
You can make there even 40 points back, but its hard thing isnt bout only reading, its bout manage to count how much such moves are worth, finding tesuji in endgame is way harder than in middle game and so on, if I recall, long time ago when Lee Changho was &#039;invincible&#039; he said even tho he posses great calculation that was the hardest part on go to study.
In go the concept of endgame got bloom around 1990+ when Lee got a lot of international titles, cause he was superior in endgame, and his play style was fresh that time.]]></description>
