		<title>Comment on Book Review: The Basics of Go Strategy by Ben Hong</title>

		<description><![CDATA[Hey! To be honest, I think the order that people read books is highly dependent on their playing style / what they are motivated to improve at the moment. As someone who likes to push the limits of my territory or frameworks, attacking and defense was the more interesting topic to me.
On the other hand though, this book does provide a great overview of basic strategy which can be useful across more of the decisions you make during a game.
Does that help?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Ben, appreciated your review of this book, was wondering would you recommend reading this before Attack and Defense? (will probably read Fundamental Principles of Go before either).  Hope things are going well off in development world and that there are chances to enjoy go now and then there.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m right there with you, but with more moves than just the 3-4 pincer!  I have an instructor that says to simply find the best move that benefits you.  That in and of itself makes sense.  It also relieves the pressure I sometimes feel to just start busying myself with memorization.  But at the same time, how do you know what&#039;s the best move in the beginning.  Understanding is better than memorization sure.  But understanding is not as easy to come by as memorization in my experience.  Thanks Ben!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks Molokai. I certainly miss writing here and getting to see everyone&#039;s input on things. There certainly doesn&#039;t seem to be enough time does there? Hope that all is well with you, and still feel free to reach out should you ever have any questions. I&#039;m still a go player no matter what!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I think at the time my co-worker was speaking more in terms of the complexities of individual pieces. After thinking about it for some time, I realized that people who haven&#039;t played go don&#039;t realize that the complexity with go does not lie in single pieces; but the overarching connections and dynamic value that changes as the game progresses.]]></description>
