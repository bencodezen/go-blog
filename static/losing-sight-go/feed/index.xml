		<description><![CDATA[Interesting. As the person playing, it&#039;s hard to gauge what my moves are saying; but I appreciate you sharing your take on it. I tried to be as calm as I could this game, but now that you mention it, my game does look rather sad. I&#039;ll be sure to mull over this.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I am rather at a loss for words for how inspiring your comment is. I am still feeling like I&#039;m grasping at straws as I&#039;m trying to be completely present in the moment, but that is part of the journey.
Your bow analogy struck a chord with me. I shall certainly decide on a direction today, and will release the string with no hesitation.
Words of inspiration to be shared by all. Thanks so much for your guidance and motivation.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[A game with you would be great Brandon! Although it would certainly not be for winning purposes. After all, if I just wanted to win, there are plenty of stupid bots for me to demolish. Haha.
I certainly hope to be able to release this attachment to winning soon. I just had a bout with it during a game earlier today, but at least I was able to let it go quicker than normal.
Let me know if you&#039;re ever free to play a friendly game! Hope all is well!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[One reason I&#039;m not going to worry is that you recognize your attachment.  One cannot let go of an attachment they don&#039;t acknowledge having.  If I can get my schedule to be less hectic, I&#039;ll have to play a game or two with you.  Those should satisfy your winning urge for awhile, seeing as I never get to play other than a little basic skill builders with my youngest son.
I understand where you&#039;re coming from.  Though I expect to lose at Go, there have been other things in my life that would cause me to exhibit the &quot;win Win WIN&quot; mentality.  I tend to be a competitive person, but I do not like being consumed by winning.  Most of these things, I was able to take a step back and look at myself, and then settle into enjoying the game again.  Hopefully, now that you recognize this attachment to winning in yourself, you will be able to consciously release it and again just enjoy the game.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This post means a lot to me.  First, that.
I have been mixing zen and go for very many years.  I found go first, then I found zazen and zen.  I lost both over the years, and gained first one, Go, back.  Now, I&#039;m regaining Zen.
It is possible to find a lot of zen in go, and go in zen.  But first and foremost, in Zen, you must start where you are.  The practice of zazen is finding yourself again and again exactly where you are.  As the basis of Zen, this makes Zen to find yourself where you are.
This post lets me see that you just found yourself, again, where you are.  This is nothing to be ashamed of.  It&#039;s just where you are.  You could find yourself nowhere else.  Now, what direction will you move in?  Aim the bow and pull...release the string!
Be where you are.  Aim, but be where you are.  There is no where else to be, any thought along those lines is delusion which does nothing but cause suffering.
May all sentient beings be without suffering.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Well in this case it was a very obvious misclick. And though I understand the perspective of &quot;no undo, even if obvious misclick,&quot; I personally would like to win my games because I am stronger and not because of a misclick. Of course it would be ridiculous to give multiple undos to an opponent who keeps asking for it, but I think not giving obvious misclicks is kind of bad sportsmanship.
In fact, the perfect scene to depict this is Hikaru vs Isumi in the pro exam. He wanted the win so bad he took the forfeit, but it ended up hurting him more in the end because he couldn&#039;t gain back his mentality. So personally, I feel that players should be confident in their own abilities and believe in themselves instead of trying to win through a misclick.
And it&#039;s not so much that wanting to win is bad, but being attached to the idea of winning and being angry at losing is what I am drawing issue with. It&#039;s emotional baggage that is unnecessary for getting stronger.
I won&#039;t be taking a break for now. The meditation and breathing techniques are fine before the game, but it&#039;s during the game where I have problems. So that&#039;s what I have to continue working on. After all, you can&#039;t really meditate in the middle of a game. I&#039;d run out of time otherwise. Haha.]]></description>
