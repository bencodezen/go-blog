		<description><![CDATA[Last year I made me a half-board for tsumego solving ( http://www.lifein19x19.com/forum/viewtopic.php?p=150356#p150356 ) I have access to all kinds of leather, but no printing presses, sadly. I drew the lines by hand with a permanent marker (after marking them by pressure.) A few days ago I also made a 13x13 hex board, I want to improve my hex abilities somewhat (I suck at hex)]]></description>
