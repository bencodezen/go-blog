		<description><![CDATA[Great article! Her answers are a comfort to read since they confirm some of my suspicions of the plight I&#039;ve been in lately.
I sure am ready for shodan, but I&#039;m in no rush to get there. Haha. I plan on conquering each rank properly (and not do the easy thing which is to create a new account and simply jump to the rank).
Thanks for the encouragement. I&#039;ll be sure to let you all know how everything is going!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks for sharing that great anecdote! It certainly gives me some hope that my situation is not hopeless. Haha. To be honest though, the slump I&#039;m in is more or less a byproduct of the fact that I&#039;ve switched styles more or less. But no matter, here&#039;s to hoping I get out of this sooner rather than later.
Hope you had a great 4th!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I was about to write something to that effect but Molokai beat me to it. I remember reading about this in an interview with Natalia Pogonina (chess grandmaster). http://www.chess.com/news/your-questions-answered-by-natalia-pogonina-1256
It&#039;s the very first answer.
I see there&#039;s quite a blue tone on this blog recently, but fear not! You&#039;ll be back in no time. The fact that you keep studying but seem getting worse (or that you&#039;re not satisfied with your playing) might actually be a good sign.
Ready for shodan? :P
Good luck, don&#039;t stop to keep us posted!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Western interpretation: Your subconscious mind is absorbing and organizing what you have learned. But your conscious mind is fighting it (&quot; I end up ignoring my instinct&quot;).
About three years ago, Magnus Carlsen the current World Champion in chess had a bit of a slump. Many thought he had peaked and could rise no further. But he persisted - though he started playing some unusual (for him) openings. When he came out of the slump a few months late his rating soon soared to the highest ever in history of the game. So, perhaps persist if you must (I would leave it alone awhile, myself) but perhaps try some different joseki, fuseki, styles to let your subconscious work unimpeded.
Now off for an evening of fireworks! Thanks much to the Chinese for inventing them. :)]]></description>
