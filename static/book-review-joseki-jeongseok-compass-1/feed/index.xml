		<description><![CDATA[[&#8230;] After a tumultuous year I think I am finally solidly within SDK. It took quite a while to get to the point where I feel confidently about that. The biggest change in my game is I stopped trying to simply save my groups or simply kill a group. I play more &#8216;asking&#8217; moves, to see where my opponent will play. I lean on one group to attack another. I play to destroy potential rather than seeking to collect it. In addition to this I learned a dozen new patterns thanks to Baduktopia&#8217;s Joseki Jeongseok Compass 1. [&#8230;]]]></description>
