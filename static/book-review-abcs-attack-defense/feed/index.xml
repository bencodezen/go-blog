		<description><![CDATA[Thanks for letting me know! I hope that anyone who&#039;s interested will have a chance to pick up a copy. And in regards to the discussion at L19, man is it getting heated... Perhaps this is the nature of forums though. Haha. A little baffling to me though.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Slate and Shell recently found some beta copies of this book they had in the dim recess of their basements, it&#039;s the same book as the final out of print copy minus the cover art and some drawings by Redmond&#039;s daughter:  http://www.slateandshell.com/SSMR001.html
Mildly amusing discussion ensues at L19:  http://www.lifein19x19.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=17&#038;t=9111]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[His variations started out relatively easy to follow at first, but then it just got incredibly intricate for my poor kyu brain. xD
Well you are most definitely welcome to borrow the book! One of the many benefits of us being able to meet up in person. Haha. And that way you don&#039;t have to try and find an out of print book! =D
And when you&#039;re done reading it, hopefully you can let me know what you think of it!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I completely agree with your sentiments on this book. Though the title would suggest an elementary introduction to attack and defense, it just doesn&#039;t quite do it as whole heartedly as I would like. I&#039;m sure I will appreciate the book more when I am stronger, but for now I&#039;m still mixed on it. =D]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[That book was based on a series he taught on NHK.  NHK then condenses those lessons and makes books based on them.  The audience level intended for the lessons can vary a bit, so it can make it a bit awkward.  Otherwise I also really like this book, but it&#039;s not high on my list to recommend to people.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Interesting that your feelings were mixed on this one. I bought Redmond&#039;s e-book on the sanrensei and found that I just wasn&#039;t ready to follow the intricate variations he used to explain things. That said, the table of contents for this particular book makes me want to read it immediately - it&#039;s very consonant with a lot of the things I&#039;ve been learning from Yuan Zhou.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks! Let me know if you find an authorized seller for this book. I can&#039;t seem to find any at the moment since it seems to be out of print. Best of luck to you!]]></description>
