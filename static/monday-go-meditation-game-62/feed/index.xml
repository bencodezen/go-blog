		<description><![CDATA[After the numerous discussion points, I do have to say that I have to agree that studying endgame can actually have beneficial effects on multiple aspects of the game regardless of whether the game reaches the endgame or not. I certainly hope to hone my endgame skills in the near future!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[33 Q17 is definitely an option for Black. I think the reason I chose not to play it is because of my study of the Chinese opening. Taking the corner allows White to attach at R15 to start making sabaki in an area where Black is strong. In addition, from my understanding, the reason the knight&#039;s move is the normal response in this scenario is because you would like to make use of the pincer stone at L16 while easily making territory.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Good question. To be honest, this particular analysis was made using SE since I didn&#039;t actually count in the game. For most of this game in particular, it was more by emotion than anything else (which is actually a really unreliable way to judge the board position). The next time I do an in-game estimation though, I&#039;ll be sure to detail it out in the game commentary for you!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Excellent point! I was so caught up in being defensive of my territory at the time that I failed to realize that there were bigger points on the board to play. Thanks for your advice!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[That&#039;s definitely another option! I think I was more concerned with sealing White in at the time. However, that cut and ko might actually be good for Black. Didn&#039;t consider it at the time!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;d just like to point out, that I disagree with move #79. For me it&#039;s begining of endgame, and corners, first! C3 or C2 would be my choice]]></description>
