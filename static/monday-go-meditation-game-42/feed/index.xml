		<description><![CDATA[Interesting notion! The thing to keep in mind regarding the right side is that moving to the left side would let White settle down easily. If you look at the right side, if White is given a strong living group, Black has little to no territory after all his efforts to building of thickness. So since you want to make most use of the thickness, you must harass the group to make it work.
The left side looks big, but remember that&#039;s aji around D10 and an extension at K14 would make it difficult for White to solidify the left. It&#039;s a very thin moyo. Granted, that&#039;s just my take on it though. =)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[D17 is not a good approach to E16 since it contacts the stone and gives White the option to choose the best variation for himself.
When attacking the group, my plan was to keep the group weak (aka giving it no base and little to no eyes) and harass it as I built the right side. Does that make sense?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Looking at this game, I can understand what you&#039;ve been saying about your own bloodlust!  I&#039;m a lowly beginner, but I feel like you responded angrily to some things that maybe weren&#039;t worth it?  I&#039;m looking at around move 87 and I feel like black is overconcentrated throughout the right half of the board and further attacking in that area is kind of unnecessary especially if white is intending to crawl on the 2nd line and such.  That whole sequence you played starting at that move, I keep thinking, why is black even responding?  The right doesn&#039;t look endangered.  The left looks the more profitable place to spend a few moves!  Am I wrong?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This is pretty insignificant but would D17 have worked in response to is E16? Also, at move 14, how did you plan on attacking the marked group?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hey Martin! Glad to finally meet you and have you join the discussion! In regards to your question, you are absolutely right. The P5 cut is a much stronger move and is much sharper than my sloppy R5 cut.
Hope to see you around the comments in the future again! And if there&#039;s ever anything I can do to make the blog more enjoyable for you, let me know and I&#039;ll do my best to do so!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Ben, I&#039;ve been a fan of your blog since a long time now and this is my first comment here :D. One question, at move 221, wasn&#039;t it better to cut at P5? That way you make O6 and R5 miai and you don&#039;t need to rely on the semeai to win.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Just got done looking through the rest of the game though and after seeing how you used forcing the bottom left to live to kill the other stones, I must say that I like your idea a lot to :D.  Job well done!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I might be wrong about this, but for move 57, I&#039;m pretty certain you can play d2 to falsify his eye there since he has to capture your two stones then you throw in again to falsify it.  I&#039;m pretty certain he can&#039;t escape to the left, and if he can make a second eye there, it will be on the second line and he&#039;ll have few points and practically no presence in the center with a weak group in the top left for you to attack.  After white made move 166 this definitely would&#039;ve worked though.]]></description>
