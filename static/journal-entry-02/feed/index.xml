		<description><![CDATA[I imagine most here have seen this article. I found it off the USGO site last week. It is beautifully written and descriptive if - IMHO - a bit flowery in its prose. (Not even sure links will copy here...) http://goinamsterdam.nl/wordpress/wp-content/media/Go-with-the-flow-Katy-Kramer.pdf]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks for the reminder flippertie! It&#039;s something I&#039;ve been meaning to get back to, but I&#039;ve been missing the spark needed to find a solution for me to get back to it in a way that isn&#039;t so time consuming. Thanks to your comment though, I will definitely put effort to bringing it back ASAP.
PS. If there&#039;s anything specific about the game reviews that you like, please let me know since it helps me know what I should spend more or less time on!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[FWIW - I&#039;m missing your game reviews.
I&#039;m definitely one of the &#039;play more&#039; brigade rather than the &#039;review regularly&#039; folks.  Your analysis of your own thinking helped me put a little more thought into my games than &#039;hmm - that looks right....&#039;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Perhaps what you and I need are friends to motivate us to play more often. I think part of my issue is I have little interest in playing strangers at the moment due to the potential time burner that games can be. Playing against friends however brings up different emotions however.
Thanks for stopping by. I&#039;m glad to see that you are posting again. Looking forward to seeing more of your posts!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m glad to see that I am not the only one who is reluctant to play games. I&#039;m happier studying than playing. I need to find a way to add regular games to my study routine. I have a friend who is the exact opposite. He&#039;d rather play than study. I watch him play game after game on the server reluctant to stop and review one game before moving on to the next. I guess he and I are like Jack Sprat and his wife. It was nice to come across your blog through the DC Go Meetup Group. You are quite an active blogger. Nice theme.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[That&#039;s a good point. I think it would be fun to do that with some friends. Maybe we can play a game next time we&#039;re both online!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Whenever I want to play go but am doubting my play after a long break, I try to open up a game and start playing without thinking about it.
I think you will be surprised at how natural thinking about moves and playing will be. I have never been particularly disappointed in my play after a break. I usually do better than I thought I would have.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Fascinating! I think that&#039;s awesome that you find your chess has improved every time you go back to chess from Go. I certainly look forward to the day I get to look at one of your games!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi, Ben - As I said previously - don&#039;t rush it, do whatever it takes to get it all together. I know standing on your head and playing over Takagawa&#039;s games in a mirror is hard work! ;)
That said, on your return I fully expect you to be ready to breakthrough to Shodan!
Right now I am also taking a Go break, seeing if the visualization work and exercises I did this summer stick. My &#039;reading&#039; is a little improved I think - but still very poor.
It is interesting tho - whenever I go back to chess from Go, my chess is improved! I believe the Go study gives me a more patient and &#039;whole board&#039; approach to chess. I start to see &#039;influence&#039; on the board, also. Tiger Hillarp, a chess grandmaster from Sweden has noted similar.
Peace!]]></description>
