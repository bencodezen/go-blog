		<description><![CDATA[Same here but it&#039;s pretty much the only way I can play full games with Ben now. It&#039;s kinda hard to find a game on KGS for me (probably because of my rank). I come on once in a while but I never really get a game. Which room are you normally in, maybe I can find you and get a teaching or something sometime :)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Can I ask what your KGS username is? I&#039;d be curious to see what I think about your fuseki. I know that I frequently find that what I think of as the most important points of my own games is not accurate at all compared to what my teacher points out, so it&#039;s useful to get other people&#039;s perspectives on where your weaknesses actually are.
It&#039;d be lovely if you dropped by on my blog from time to time - it&#039;ll encourage me to post more!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I really appreciate the advice, Nate. I think that the main problem with my game right now is that my fuseki is horrible and I lose my advantage as black very fast. I think that I&#039;ll start reading your blog which I just discovered a couple of days ago. You seem to have explained everything quite well. Thanks a lot Nate. :)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Finding straightforward, good play is what the fundamentals are all about. My favorite Go book is Lessons in the Fundamentals of Go (http://senseis.xmp.net/?LessonsInTheFundamentalsOfGo) by Kageyama Toshiro. He talks a lot about the basic things that have to undergird any go player&#039;s style: keeping stones connected, clarity of reading, good shape, life and death, and a sense for tesujis. At my level (I&#039;m 2k on KGS), those fundamentals are still the primary determining factor in who wins or loses.
Often there are multiple good, playable alternatives, and a sense of style can start to form from your own ideas of what is best to play in those situations, but the necessary precedent to that is a clear understanding of what the good moves are.
I used to think of my style as being more territorial - when I learned how much territory I could grab by playing Hashimoto&#039;s opening, or dual komokus, I focused on grabbing cash and then just ruining the value of the influence I gave up later on. But that &quot;style&quot; has limitations, and in my case it wasn&#039;t so much a style as it was a lack of really appreciating the value of influence and thickness. As I came to understand that a bit better, my style shifted, and I started winning more games.
All that is to say that you may develop some sense of your own style, but it&#039;s important not to let your style *lead* your strategies, but to let your style follow the strategies you understand best. Make it a goal to understand the way your favorite openings develop into the middle game as well as possible. And if you enjoy the games you play, keep playing that way until your curiosity leads you another direction. Soon you&#039;ll find that there are a number of different ways you can play comfortably.]]></description>
