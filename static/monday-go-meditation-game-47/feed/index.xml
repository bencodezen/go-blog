		<description><![CDATA[Ah. So if White H18, Black can actually just connect at F19 and ignore the ko entirely (in terms of the local battle). So in that regard the eye would be falsified instantly.
However, when we account more of the board, there is a weakness at E18 which would actually probably end up forcing a ko later on.
Does that make sense?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Sorry,  I wasn&#039;t saying anything that complicated.  All I was saying was that in response to black h19, white h18.  Then it&#039;s a ko right there on the edge of the board.  If white wins, he captures black&#039;s h19 and makes an eye.  Right?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Capping is the right idea here since black has walls on the top and bottom of the board which will aid black in keeping white from escaping to his group on the left.  Black also has stones that undercut white&#039;s invasion, so it is very had for white to gain anything other than life once he&#039;s capped.
If white k17 as you say after black g19, then all black has to do is play h19.  White doesn&#039;t have an eye there.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks! I was starting to doubt whether the time I spent talking about every move was worth it, but it seems like it is. Haha.
I will have to say that sometimes during a game, I&#039;m not able to articulate my thoughts nearly as well though. Sometimes moves are made impulsively as opposed to thought out the way they appear in the game. I should definitely try being more patient about each of my moves though. It might make me play better. Haha.
Move 5 - Well clearly you have good intuition! Haha. These kinds of things started coming into my decision making after having my games reviewed a few times by dan players. I&#039;m glad that it&#039;s helping you develop more seriousness for every move you play!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Interesting idea! I hadn&#039;t thought of Move 58 as wrong when I was reviewing it, but perhaps you are correct. I think part of the issue at the time was that I didn&#039;t see myself making much territory by attacking it since he had a lot of room to maneuver in the center. And as you pointed out, the resulting sequence ended up not giving Black much anyway, so I think you are correct in that my original attack was misguided.
In regards to the eye around 159 (in the second variation), if White K17 then Black would H19. But if I look ahead, I am seeing a potential capturing race that is probably what you&#039;re referring to in regards to the ko. Nice catch! I clearly have some work to do on my own reading. Haha. Thanks for the feedback!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[At move 58, I&#039;m stunned you pushed him toward the edge instead of toward the center!  Running to the edge is a classic way to look for life, right?  You say it&#039;s cramped, and I guess it is, but it&#039;s not *that* cramped (as subsequent moves arguably showed).  But if he runs toward the center, what can he do?  He has no friends there.  The center is a harsh, empty desert to try to scratch out a living in.  He&#039;s flanked by you part of the way.  And you can build yourself toward the center while chasing him, plus blocking near the edge connected your top with your bottom!  Well, that&#039;s my thinking anyway.
And later in the game, I kept waiting for K18, and when it finally came, despite the variations given, I don&#039;t fully see how black can unequivocally prevent white from living.  At 159, I choose option 2.  After black 161, white K17.  Now the best black can do is ko, right?  Or am I (as usual) missing something critical?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Made it until move 49 ... will continue next time i have some time for go :)
I like your reviews very much, because they are so detailed and one is never lost...
and it says something about the way you play go: you do not play random, for every move you have reason ... one feels this when reading you review.
Move 5 : I play these kind of moves often just by accident/or intuition, without this kind of considerations ... but reading your reviews helps to delvelop more seriousness for -every- move i play.]]></description>
