		<description><![CDATA[Love the art for this one. And to your point, I think that the key to the success of &quot;setting up shop&quot; in places like book stores or coffee shops is marketing strategy and follow up. I plan to design business cards and probably design a brochure that is easy to follow and sells the game... There is more, but perhaps that gives you a little insight into my vision for the future. =D
And just for your knowledge before I manage to release the GSA Tesuji book, it surprised me and I found it that it&#039;s actually quite appropriate for beginners. Definitely don&#039;t hesitate to start on it. (And in case you come back and tell me there are some advanced problems in there... Yes. There are some advanced ones, but overall it&#039;s actually quite nice for people starting out with tesujis. =D)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Sounds the folks at your local Starbucks are pretty laid-back. :)  Back when used to play chess would sometimes meet a friend at Subway (the halfway point between us) which made it a little more interesting, the people there where super nice and every now and then someone would ask about the game and that might spark an interesting conversation.  Remember reading somewhere some time ago about a go club that would occasionally set up shop at a Barnes &#038; Noble with a similar idea, apparently they had a little success.  Anyway, I think it&#039;s pretty cool of you to want to do this.  Be sure to let us know how things go if you&#039;re able to follow through on the idea at starbaduk.  Good luck!
Looking forward to the Get Strong at Invading review, is one of the books that just came along with GSA: Attacking, Endgame  (needed something to keep GSA: Tesuji company on the shelf) will probably be awhile before I &#039;get&#039; to it though. :)
You&#039;re not alone with the HnG thing, put myself on restriction (it&#039;s just soo goood!).
