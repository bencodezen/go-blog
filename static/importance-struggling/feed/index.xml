		<description><![CDATA[Well to some degree, the &quot;struggle&quot; I&#039;m referring to is in regards to actually spending time to rewire those circuits in your brain. And so when you find those glaring mistakes and think about why you made them, that is considered a &quot;struggle&quot; if you think about it.
For me, learning has always been more like. &quot;Oh that&#039;s wrong. Okay I&#039;ll try and remember next time.&quot; Never really mulled over it or anything. Does that make sense?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I don&#039;t think &quot;deliberate learning&quot; has to mean a struggle. I&#039;ve had a lot of success finding the most glaring mistakes in a game and just thinking about why I made them. &quot;Oh! I thought I&#039;d win that semai because I didn&#039;t notice these stones would get into a shortage of liberties. I need to pay better attention to that.&quot; And then moving on. Under a minute of attention. Over time your brain starts fixing re-occurring themes.
For example, I&#039;ve been losing games lately because I get complacent with a lead and let my opponent seal off too much center territory. When that happens I try to find the key moves that gave up the lead, look at the board, and remind myself of the dangerous position that this is. Hopefully soon I&#039;ll have warning sirens going off in the back of my head before I give up a won game, rather than after =)]]></description>

You just opened my eyes to the right way of learning Go. I might just need to rethink my method of studying Go :)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[That is GREAT advice.  It says things that I&#039;ve been learning lately, but didn&#039;t have the words for.  It&#039;s like, it isn&#039;t perfectionism, it&#039;s just what you do when you love something enough to want to get it right: it&#039;s how you go beyond competent and move toward talent.
Great post.]]></description>
