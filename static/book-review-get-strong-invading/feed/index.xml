		<description><![CDATA[Thanks for the thoughtful response, some interesting things to consider.  What you said about sacrificing stones kind of stuck a chord (could be wrong but my impression is that that I sometimes sacrifice stones too willingly and am not getting the full benefit of the aji they may possess).  Anyway this is definitely something to continue to ponder as I move forward with play and studies.  Look forward to reading more of your thoughts on the subject in a future article. :D]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hmmm... if I were to give a summary of what I think is necessary for being a merciless marauder, it would be this: Learn how to sacrifice groups and not save everything. Now obviously this is an extremely loaded statement and not nearly as simple as it sounds, but when going over games of pros (or having your own games reviewed), you&#039;ll find that successful invasions involve using probes to exploit aji along with being aware of when it is okay to sacrifice the tail of the dragon so that the body can live.
If invading is something you are finding you enjoy greatly, than playing more territorially will make more sense since you will not create very many weak groups and can focus on making the invasion successful. On the other hand, if you enjoy your opponents invading and chasing them, then playing a moyo strategy is the other way to go.
I hope I&#039;ve given you some ideas as to how you can work towards becoming successful at being aggressive. I will be sure to jot this down as a future article though, since it&#039;s obviously quite a deep topic. =)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Nice write up Ben, look forward to reading it (need to get busy working on the pile of books that stand between me and this).
About your advice in the last paragraph.  Is there something other then practicing (in games) studying tsumego and such that could be recommended to polish these multiple aspects of becoming a merciless marauder.  Maybe reviewing games of pros who have an aggressive style?  Anything else?
This subject is one that interests me very much.  Even though a novice, have already felt that one of the great thrills of go is when both I and opponent try to stuff as many stones as possible into each others territory.  It feels like my attitude about being invaded is changing, like I want them to invade as much as possible, only holding out hope that I can occupy their arena just a bit more in the end. :D]]></description>
