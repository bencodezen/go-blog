		<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s funny you should mention this. You are not the first to bring up the fact that I should consider writing my own book. And just so you know, it&#039;s definitely something that has crossed my mind and something I am seriously considering the future. And when I do, you can be sure I&#039;ll let you know about it. Thanks for the encouragement!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks Robby! I&#039;m glad that you enjoyed the review. I know that sometimes my commentary is a little overly basic and could even be omitted, but I thought that it&#039;d be best to just be consistent in order to keep the reader engage.
And I welcome your quote! I definitely have no intention of letting your accolades get to my head. I&#039;m just glad that my work and effort is actually &quot;in service&quot; of my fellow go players. That is enough gratification for me. And I always strive to be better and know that will always be room for improvement. Thanks again for your feedback!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I do wish you would someday publish in a &quot;pay money to read this e-book or pay even more for a soft back version&quot; of say 100-of your wonderful game reviews split-up into chapters wherein several game reviews in each chapter serve to highlight various systemic &quot;weakness&quot; areas, or areas that seem to normally confuse kyu players between 10-kyu and say, 3-kyu.   That would be brilliant and you certainly have the ability.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Absolutely superb effort.  Thanks, Ben.  No way I would have ever had the kahoonas to try to review the greastest games of this decade but you did a brilliant job of it and I actually walk away having learned quiet a bit because of your comments and the fun questions you posted for us to puzzle through.  Thank you so much for taking time from your family and profession to serve the rest of us with your sharp mind and simple goodness.  You&#039;re a great man.  Now don&#039;t get all excited at me Ben - you know I&#039;m an LDS Bishop so I do hope you will forgive this quick quote from the Book of Mormon:  &quot;When you are in the service of your fellow man you are in the service of your God&quot;.  Superb work my dear friend, Robby]]></description>
