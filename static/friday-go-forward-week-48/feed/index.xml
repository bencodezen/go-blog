		<description><![CDATA[Very good experience overall. I ordered 1 dan of tsumego, and 3 dan of tesuji and tsumego (IIRC, the missing one was unavailable.) I also ordered some random Japanese books that seemed interesting (there&#039;s one I love with 270 problems about cutting and connecting.) Everything arrived in roughly 3-4 weeks, neatly packed and protected. Happy overall, the same with Yutopian by the way: I ordered Seigen-Segoe tesuji books from them and they also arrived quickly and neatly.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The GGPD (Kiseido English Version) I have runs roughly 1d to 3d. There are a couple of problems designated 1k, but we all know that rank is kind of abstract depending on the player.
They are overall not too bad. I will have to admit that I am approaching it more like a learning experience as opposed to practicing reading (due to time limitations). Based on instinct alone though, I seem to be doing alright. Haha. I hope to go through it more detailed in the future though.
How was your experience with yesasia?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Curious: the Japanese edition of GGPD (the one I have, ordered from yesasia.com) has books for 1d, 3d, 5d and 7d, each with 150 problems. I wonder if volume 1 is 1-3 or 3-5.
How are you finding them? I found the first 100 pretty easy (10-20% of failures) but somehow the latter 50 harder, even though Bill Spight said it&#039;s quite likely a feeling I got and that all problems are relatively similar.]]></description>
