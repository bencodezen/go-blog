		<description><![CDATA[Hi Ben I suppose I am good with this.. though the cut ends up being between the 5,3 and and 7,3 stone  (which is much further out) rather than the 3,4 and the 5,3 stone .. thanks again]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[In regards to a local exchange, White&#039;s corner is rather large in this problem; but this exchange could be excellent if we assume Black has a moyo/wall on the right already.
So one thing to keep in mind for the Level Up Series is that the key thing they&#039;re training is technique. Unless a whole board is presented, don&#039;t worry to much about global context. Does that make sense?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Alright. So for Page 64 - Problem 24 (Level Up 8). If White 2 at 5-5 point, then Black will take the 3-1 point to make miai for the second eye at 6-1 or 5-2 (since White has to throw in in order to falsify it. Let me know if it&#039;s still confusing.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[i&#039;ve noticed you have been catching a few of the mistakes in these series ... take a look at page 64 problem 24.. I don&#039;t think this is solvable.. as white has another move 2 that is at the 5,5 point.. am I missing something?]]></description>
