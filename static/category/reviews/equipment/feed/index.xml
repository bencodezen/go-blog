<h2 style="text-align: center;">The Dirt Cheap Go Set</h2>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> &#8220;Are you looking for an affordable Go set? Look no further. The Dirt Cheap Go Set is a complete, full size Go game set at an unbeatable price! Each set includes one foldable 19&#215;19 plastic Go board, 180 Go stones of each color (black and white) and two plastic Go bowls. Because the board can be folded and sealed tightly inside one of the bowls (with the stones) this set is also compact and portable.&#8221; &#8211; GoGameGuru<br />

<strong>What&#8217;s the best aspect about this product?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Price and affordability.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What is the weakest aspect of this product?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The stones come with a rather strong plastic smell that needs to be washed away.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Is it durable?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>It&#8217;s as durable as you expect plastic to be.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Bottom Line</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">Be mindful that with the cheap price comes a sacrifice in quality players tend to look for in their go sets.</span></li>
<li>Not recommended if this is your first set since it can warp your perception of what most go sets are like.</li>
<li>Recommended as a great go set for people looking to get started for club materials.</li>

[expand title=&#8221;My Review&#8221; trigclass=&#8221;expandTitle&#8221; expanded=&#8221;true&#8221;]
As always, we start with the product itself!<br />
<figure id="attachment_4605" style="width: 490px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/02/dirtcheapgoset02.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-4605" alt="dirtcheapgoset02" src="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/02/dirtcheapgoset02.jpg?resize=490%2C368" width="490" height="368" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">For those wondering what language is on the box, it&#8217;s Simplified Chinese.</figcaption></figure>
<figure id="attachment_4606" style="width: 490px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/02/dirtcheapgoset03.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-4606" alt="dirtcheapgoset03" src="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/02/dirtcheapgoset03.jpg?resize=490%2C368" width="490" height="368" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Box wide open!</figcaption></figure>
The following picture shows the contents of the box: the plastic go board and the go bowls (with the stones inside).</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/02/dirtcheapgoset04.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-4607" alt="dirtcheapgoset04" src="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/02/dirtcheapgoset04.jpg?resize=490%2C368" width="490" height="368" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Before opening the bowls, I was expecting the stones to be in their respective colored bowl; but this is nice in its own way since it provides contrast when looking into the bowl for stones. When I did open them though, I will have to say that a strong plastic / crayon like smell immediately hit me (which was rather unpleasant). So if you&#8217;re buying this for kids, please open it yourself and rinse the stones and wash it before you give it to them.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/02/dirtcheapgoset05.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-4608" alt="dirtcheapgoset05" src="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/02/dirtcheapgoset05.jpg?resize=490%2C368" width="490" height="368" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">In the next image, you&#8217;ll see a close-up of the stones (which are mono-convex). You&#8217;ll notice they are slightly grainy due to the material it&#8217;s made out of and different from say glass stones.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/02/dirtcheapgoset06.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-4609" alt="dirtcheapgoset06" src="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/02/dirtcheapgoset06.jpg?resize=490%2C368" width="490" height="368" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Here is the board fully unfolded. You can see that it&#8217;s kind of wrinkled, but this is to be expected since this is a plastic board that is stored by folding it. And as you might expect, it is lightweight and would easily fly away if nothing was on it and the wind was blowing.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/02/dirtcheapgoset07.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-4610" alt="dirtcheapgoset07" src="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/02/dirtcheapgoset07.jpg?resize=490%2C368" width="490" height="368" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Here are some shots of the board in action. Overall, it&#8217;s a pleasure to use and you&#8217;ll notice looks quite nice overall. The stones are a bit light for my liking, but one cannot expect too much for a go set that totals are $15 and is lightweight and portable. =D</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/02/dirtcheapgoset08.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-4611" alt="dirtcheapgoset08" src="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/02/dirtcheapgoset08.jpg?resize=490%2C368" width="490" height="368" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/02/dirtcheapgoset09.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-4612" alt="dirtcheapgoset09" src="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/02/dirtcheapgoset09.jpg?resize=490%2C368" width="490" height="368" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">This set is definitely a great one for those looking to start a go club and who needs a large number of sets while being on a budget. However, if you can just save a little bit more or are looking to buy an affordable set while not breaking the bank, I would recommend checking out the <a title="Equipment Review: The Go Bento Box" href="//equipment-review-go-bento-box/">Go Game Bento Box</a>. Hope that this review has helped!</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Slate and Shell Go Stones &#8211; Sample Pack &#8211; Size 36 Biconvex</h2>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> &#8220;This is a sample pack of our size 36 slate and shell Go stones, which are among the highest quality Go stones available. It contains three black stones and three white stones. Size 36 refers to the thickness of the stone (in this case 10.4 mm or 0.41 inches). The additional thickness and weight of these stones gives them a pleasant feeling in your hand and produces a sharp and satisfying snapping sound when the stones are played.&#8221; &#8211; GoGameGuru<br />

<p><strong>What is the weakest aspect of this product?</strong></p>

[expand title=&#8221;My Review&#8221; trigclass=&#8221;expandTitle&#8221; expanded=&#8221;true&#8221;]
The sample comes in a nice little cloth bag with the BadukBrother logo clearly marked.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/02/slateshellsample02.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-4594" alt="slateshellsample02" src="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/02/slateshellsample02.jpg?resize=490%2C368" width="490" height="368" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">When you remove the stones from the bag, you can see that it is in a nice plastic bag (which provides the actual protection in shipping).</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/02/slateshellsample03.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-4595" alt="slateshellsample03" src="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/02/slateshellsample03.jpg?resize=368%2C490" width="368" height="490" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">With the stones removed, you can see them glistening in the light. Very pretty. =)</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/02/slateshellsample04.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-4596" alt="slateshellsample04" src="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/02/slateshellsample04.jpg?resize=490%2C368" width="490" height="368" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The one thing I will say is that the beautiful pattern you are used to seeing on shell stones was harder to capture in the pictures. I think that this is due to the fact that the size of the stones (and for those who don&#8217;t know, size 36 is pretty large) and that this is a sample pack is a reason for why the pattern is more faded compared to the set that I own. However, since this is not a full set, I would not take this as an alarming fact since your purpose with this sample pack is to really get a feel for slate and shell as opposed to just the look.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/02/slateshellsample05.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-4597" alt="slateshellsample05" src="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/02/slateshellsample05.jpg?resize=490%2C368" width="490" height="368" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">At the end of the day, they arrived in perfect condition which is precisely what someone needs when they want to find out if they really want to own a set of slate and shell. If you&#8217;re interested in getting a slate and shell stone set but worried if the value is worth the price, be sure to grab one of these sample packs from GoGameGuru to help you make an informed decision. Good luck!</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">PS. I do own a full set of slate and shell stones, so let me know if you ever have any questions.</p>

[expand title=&#8221;My Review&#8221; trigclass=&#8221;expandTitle&#8221; expanded=&#8221;true&#8221;]
Here&#8217;s the front of the board at a slanted angle. It&#8217;s a nice yellow color to give it a semi-shin-kaya feel. (I prefer the yellow color over brown since it shows more contrast when stones are placed on the board; but that&#8217;s just a personal preference.)</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/01/dirtcheapgoboard02.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-4544" alt="dirtcheapgoboard02" src="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/01/dirtcheapgoboard02.jpg?resize=360%2C270" width="360" height="270" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">And here below, you can see that there&#8217;s a Chinese chess board on the back!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/01/dirtcheapgoboard03.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-4545" alt="dirtcheapgoboard03" src="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/01/dirtcheapgoboard03.jpg?resize=360%2C270" width="360" height="270" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Upon closer inspection, you&#8217;ll see that the lines are not perfectly straight the way you&#8217;ll see on higher quality boards. However, I wouldn&#8217;t let this be a deterrent from purchasing the board if it&#8217;s being used for casual play.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/01/dirtcheapgoboard04.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-4546" alt="dirtcheapgoboard04" src="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/01/dirtcheapgoboard04.jpg?resize=360%2C270" width="360" height="270" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Here are a couple of shots with the board in action with my size 36 glass stones. As you can see, the lines are not so obvious from a player&#8217;s perspective.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/01/dirtcheapgoboard05.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-4547" alt="dirtcheapgoboard05" src="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/01/dirtcheapgoboard05.jpg?resize=360%2C270" width="360" height="270" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/01/dirtcheapgoboard06.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-4548" alt="dirtcheapgoboard06" src="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/01/dirtcheapgoboard06.jpg?resize=360%2C270" width="360" height="270" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/01/dirtcheapgoboard07.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-4549" alt="dirtcheapgoboard07" src="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/01/dirtcheapgoboard07.jpg?resize=360%2C270" width="360" height="270" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Bottom line: I highly recommend this board for people who are looking to purchase boards for their club or for tournaments. This board would also function well as a casual study/playing board. However, I would definitely not recommend this as a primary goban for anyone who is looking for that classic air and sound you get from true wooden boards. So remember, the key thing to remember is that this is a board that focuses on affordability and practicality.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">The Featherweight Go Set</h2>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> &#8220;Weighing in at just 20.5 oz (580 g), the Featherweight Go Set is even lighter than your average travel Go set. But here&#8217;s the thing; it&#8217;s a proper, full sized Go board with stones. It includes size 21 plastic stones (0.3 inches or 8 mm thick) with a 0.8 inch (20 mm) diameter and a durable, full size, crease resistant 19&#215;19 plastic Go board. The board can easily be folded or rolled, making this set highly portable. Keep a set in your bag or briefcase so that you&#8217;re always ready for a serendipitous game of Go!&#8221; &#8211; GoGameGuru<br />

<strong>What&#8217;s the best aspect about this product?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Portability! It&#8217;s one of the lightest products I&#8217;ve encountered while still maintaining decent quality!</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What is the weakest aspect of this product?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>As someone who is used to using real stones, the stones can feel a bit lighter than desired; but to be honest, it beats not having any board or stones to play when you&#8217;re out and about!</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Is it durable?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The stones are plastic and should hold up well enough. The board is made of fabric so it shouldn&#8217;t tear so easily, but will probably wear out over time with use and will eventually need replacing.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Bottom Line</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Great lightweight go set for that one can easily pack without noticing any additional weight or bulkiness.</li>
<li>Recommended for any player looking to always have a go set on hand without the hassle or concern over the safety of a wooden board or real stones.</li>
</ol>

[expand title=&#8221;My Review&#8221; trigclass=&#8221;expandTitle&#8221; expanded=&#8221;true&#8221;]
True to their word, this featherweight go set came packed in a super light way with no bulky boxes!<br />
<figure id="attachment_4492" style="width: 360px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/01/featherweightgoset02.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-4492" alt="featherweightgoset02" src="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/01/featherweightgoset02.jpg?resize=360%2C270" width="360" height="270" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">As you can see, everything fits in one bag!</figcaption></figure>
<figure id="attachment_4493" style="width: 360px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/01/featherweightgoset03.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-4493" alt="featherweightgoset03" src="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/01/featherweightgoset03.jpg?resize=360%2C270" width="360" height="270" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Contents of the bag: two bags of stones and one board</figcaption></figure>
<figure id="attachment_4494" style="width: 360px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/01/featherweightgoset04.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-4494" alt="featherweightgoset04" src="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/01/featherweightgoset04.jpg?resize=360%2C270" width="360" height="270" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">The board unfolded</figcaption></figure>
The board is made of fabric and has a nice feel to it. It does have a little issue staying flat after being packaged and folded for so long, but a little patience and flattening helped to keep it pretty straight. And like the description says, it really does feel like a full size board when you spread it out over the table.<br />
<figure id="attachment_4495" style="width: 360px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/01/featherweightgoset05.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-4495" alt="featherweightgoset05" src="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/01/featherweightgoset05.jpg?resize=360%2C270" width="360" height="270" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Close-up of the stones</figcaption></figure>
As you can see for the stones, they are not simply plastic biconvex stones; but they also have a flat center on both sides in order to ease with the stone placement on the board. Though this is contrary to typical stone design, I think that this works out great for this set since the plastic stones are not very heavy to begin with. So as a result, the flat center really helps out.<br />
<figure id="attachment_4496" style="width: 360px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/01/featherweightgoset06.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-4496" alt="featherweightgoset06" src="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/01/featherweightgoset06.jpg?resize=360%2C270" width="360" height="270" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Entire set in action</figcaption></figure>
<figure id="attachment_4497" style="width: 360px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/01/featherweightgoset07.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-4497" alt="featherweightgoset07" src="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/01/featherweightgoset07.jpg?resize=360%2C270" width="360" height="270" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Close-up of the set in action</figcaption></figure>
As you can see, it&#8217;s a great set that really provides a wonderful experience when it&#8217;s impossible to carry around a wooden board and real stones. As someone who has used cheaper &#8220;featherweight&#8221; sets that were plastic boards and such, this is a huge improvement and is the one I recommend if you&#8217;re looking for your &#8220;featherweight go set.&#8221; Hope this helped!<br />

<li>If you like stones that are glossy and shine in the light, this is a great set for you.</li>
<li>For those who are not yet able to afford a set of slate and shell stones, this is a great set that gives a similar feel (i.e., smooth) and look (i.e., glossiness) without the hefty price tag.</li>

[expand title=&#8221;My Review&#8221; trigclass=&#8221;expandTitle&#8221; expanded=&#8221;true&#8221;]
In my go collection, I&#8217;ve owned my fair share of different types of stones: yunzi, slate and shell, and plastic. The funny thing is that glass stones have always been relatively inexpensive to some of the stones I have bought; but no longer, that ends with this set!<br />

<span style="line-height: 1.5em;">As someone who started out using yunzi stones, I was a bit surprised at how slippery it was when I first started using it. Stones would slip out of my fingers constantly. However, after a bit of patience and realizing I couldn&#8217;t grip them with the same force I normally gripped yunzi stones, it came a lot easier and they did not fall out nearly as often.</span><span style="line-height: 1.5em;"><br />
</span><br />
At the end of the day, this is a beautiful set that any player would be delighted to have if they are looking for stones with a glossy finish that shine in the light. Highly recommended and as always, let me know if you have any questions about the set!<br />

<li>Can&#8217;t really say that there&#8217;s anything weak about the product, but I would say I might have preferred kitani style bowls with the engraving. Just a personal preference though. xD</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Is it durable?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Seems like it would hold up to normal usage, but I would be wary of letting it topple off of a high shelf onto cement floor.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Bottom Line</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Beautiful and gorgeous bowls that will comfortably hold any standard size go stones.</li>
<li>The orchard engraving is a great touch that really helps to give it a nice touch.</li>
<li>Totally worth it for those who want a bit of art along with their go bowl.</li>
</ol>

[expand title=&#8221;What I Was Hoping For&#8221; trigclass=&#8221;expandTitle&#8221;]
A beautiful set of rosewood orchid-engraved bowls that would hold my size 36 glass stones perfectly!<br />

[expand title=&#8221;My Review&#8221; trigclass=&#8221;expandTitle&#8221; expanded=&#8221;true&#8221;]
As my first artistic go bowl set, I was really excited when it finally came in the mail.<br />

When I opened the box, I was really pleased to see that it was packaged really well so that nothing would be damaged in transit. A+ for their packing job!<br />

Woot!</figcaption></figure>
<p style="text-align: left;">At the end of the day, they do the job they were intended to do: hold go stones. =) They just do it with a bit of flair since they have the orchid engraving. Haha. But if you have any interest in owning bowls like this, I would highly recommend them!</p>

[expand title=&#8221;What I Was Hoping For&#8221; trigclass=&#8221;expandTitle&#8221;]
When <a href="https://twitter.com/AmbyR00">AmbyR00</a> first told me about his board, I was hoping that it would be something that would be easily stored away and difficult to store away. In addition, I was hoping that it would be made of quality leather so that it didn&#8217;t feel cheap and easily frayed and damaged.<br />
[/expand]
[expand title=&#8221;My Review&#8221; trigclass=&#8221;expandTitle&#8221; expanded=&#8221;true&#8221;]
A majority of the gobans that I have owned thus far have all been made of wood, so I was thrilled to get a chance to review a goban made of non-traditional material!<br />
<figure id="attachment_4441" style="width: 360px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/01/leathergoban01.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-4441" alt="leathergoban01" src="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/01/leathergoban01.jpg?resize=360%2C270" width="360" height="270" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Here is it in all its glory! (The back is just a straight leather pattern with no markings, so I didn&#8217;t take a picture of it.)</figcaption></figure>
<p style="text-align: left;">Though impacted by a slight tinge of yellow lighting, the board is a beautiful coffee brown color that contrasts really well with the black lines drawn for the goban.</p>
<figure id="attachment_4447" style="width: 360px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/01/leathergoban06.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-4447" alt="leathergoban06" src="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/01/leathergoban06.jpg?resize=360%2C270" width="360" height="270" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Here&#8217;s a close-up of AmbyR00&#8217;s signature! So cool!</figcaption></figure>
<p style="text-align: left;">As it stands, I think that this makes a great table goban since it&#8217;s super light-weight and is really a pleasure to use. Here are some pictures of the board in action!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/01/leathergoban02.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-4443" alt="leathergoban02" src="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/01/leathergoban02.jpg?resize=360%2C270" width="360" height="270" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>

<p style="text-align: left;">At the end of the day, if you&#8217;re looking for a light-weight goban that looks gorgeous and is easy to store away, this leather goban definitely fits the bill! Let me know if you ever have any additional questions!</p>
[/expand]
[expand title=&#8221;How Was It Made?&#8221; trigclass=&#8221;expandTitle&#8221; expanded=&#8221;true&#8221;]
<em>The original post can be found here: &#8220;<a title="AmbyR00's Blog Post on Creating His Leather Goban" href="http://worldismygoban.blogspot.fi/2010/12/leather-is-sexy-especially-with-polka.html">Leather is sexy, especially with polka dots</a>&#8220;, but I&#8217;ve recreated the content here because my biggest fear is that the link might break one day if Blogger ever goes down.</em><br />
&#8220;As I&#8217;m working as an intern in a little workshop that prints and binds calendars and presses many different things from many different materials I got an opportunity to use a silk press to print some leather gobans for the go club I plan to set up. Now all I need is some stones.<br />
I used Inkscape to create <a href="http://ubuntuone.com/p/SUZ/">the print</a> (hint: use Inkscape to view it!) on the leather board, you can download the design and freely use it with your own goban. I printed the board on six transparencies, that I taped together and used as a film to develop a template for the silk press. I was originally going for six goban, but ended up with ten of them.<br />
<figure id="attachment_4616" style="width: 400px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/01/leathergobanpost01.jpeg"><img class="size-full wp-image-4616" alt="leathergobanpost01" src="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/01/leathergobanpost01.jpeg?resize=400%2C300" width="400" height="300" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">The leather before it was cut. This wasn&#8217;t the only one.</figcaption></figure>
<figure id="attachment_4617" style="width: 480px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/01/leathergobanpost02.jpeg"><img class="size-full wp-image-4617" alt="leathergobanpost02" src="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/01/leathergobanpost02.jpeg?resize=480%2C640" width="480" height="640" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">This was the template used to create the prints on the boards.</figcaption></figure>
The finished boards look actually very nice. Leather is pretty good material for creating something like a portable goban. I&#8217;ll need to take a picture of one in daylight so it captures the whole beauty of them. Here&#8217;s one I took with my phone when they were out from print and drying up:<br />
<figure id="attachment_4618" style="width: 472px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/01/leathergobanpost03.jpeg"><img class=" wp-image-4618" alt="leathergobanpost03" src="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/01/leathergobanpost03.jpeg?resize=472%2C354" width="472" height="354" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">The finished boards. The polka dots really cheer them up.</figcaption></figure>
Actually, these are not the first boards I have made, I also did some smaller practice boards few months ago from plywood, <a href="http://www.dammfine.com/projects/gobans/">laser printed paper gobans</a>, glue and water.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/01/leathergobanpost04.jpeg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-4619" alt="leathergobanpost04" src="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/01/leathergobanpost04.jpeg?resize=464%2C348" width="464" height="348" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">See you later! ^^ /gg&#8221;</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Folding Go Board</h2>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> When it comes to go on the go (yes that just happened), this folding go board from GoGameGuru really does seem to hit the sweet spot between portability, quality, and price. It utilizes a hinge mechanism to keep the go board in one piece and even has a Chinese chess board on the reverse side! Recommended stone size are 21 or 22. It fits other stones, but it&#8217;s a bit snug. Highly recommended!<br />

<strong>What&#8217;s the best aspect about this product?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A legitimate portable wooden board that looks great when using it!</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What is one aspect this product could improve on?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>This is expected and in the product description, but I can&#8217;t help but wish that the board could accommodate all sizes of stones. Granted, that would make the board larger; but it&#8217;s just a small thing that would be nice. =D</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Is it durable?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>So far so good! The laminate does seem like it could dent if you dropped something heavy on it, but it seems to hold up just fine with regular use (aka placing stones on the board). The wood also seems quite solid, but I would refrain from dropping it.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Bottom Line</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>An incredible portable board that looks great when you&#8217;re using it.</li>
<li>Fits like a dream in my backpack and delivers on portability.</li>
<li>The best portable board I&#8217;ve seen on the market so far. Highly recommended!</li>

[expand title=&#8221;What I Was Hoping For&#8221; trigclass=&#8221;expandTitle&#8221;]
For those who have been following me since the beginning, I&#8217;m sure you remembered that I bought <a title="Equipment Review: Folding Wooden Go Board" href="//equipment-review-folding-wooden-go-board/">one</a> quite some time ago. During my hiatus of go, it transferred ownership to my good friend Nate. So naturally, with me being back in go full force, it was inevitable that I would need to find a replacement. And though I have seen one or two online, the shipping has always been rather ridiculous or the board wasn&#8217;t quite what I was looking for. So when I found out about this product, I couldn&#8217;t order it fast enough!<br />
[/expand]
[expand title=&#8221;My Review&#8221; trigclass=&#8221;expandTitle&#8221; expanded=&#8221;true&#8221;]
<figure id="attachment_4330" style="width: 320px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2013/11/foldinggoban02.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-4330" alt="foldinggoban02" src="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2013/11/foldinggoban02.jpg?resize=320%2C240" width="320" height="240" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Folding go board in its box (front side)</figcaption></figure>

<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2013/11/foldinggoban04.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-4332" alt="foldinggoban04" src="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2013/11/foldinggoban04.jpg?resize=320%2C240" width="320" height="240" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">As you can see in the pictures above, the board comes in a well designed box that looked quite professional. If they could translate the text into English, I could totally see this product being primed for being sold in Western stores (since some people just get weirded out by languages they don&#8217;t understand). Some of the go products I&#8217;ve seen sold in book stores and such seem a bit shoddy and could really use a make-over.</p>

This was a pleasant surprise for me when I unfolded it. I used to play Chinese chess when I was a kid and so I was pretty psyched when I found out that this portable board could also double as a Chinese chess board. Score! But for the those who have no interest in this side, you can take comfort in that the hinges are exposed on this side so that it does not interfere with the go side of the board.<br />

As you can see from the photos of the board in action, the size 36 stones fit rather snugly on the board and can feel a bit cluttered. So though it does fit, it would make for a more enjoyable experience to use size 21/22 stones as recommended. As a result, it&#8217;s no surprise that I will would recommend the <a title="Equipment Review: The Go Bento Box" href="//equipment-review-go-bento-box/">Go Bento Box</a> as this board&#8217;s traveling companion.<br />
At the end of the day, this board really does a remarkable job of providing portability, great value, and a very pleasing aesthetic look for an incredible price. Definitely well worth every penny. So if you&#8217;re in the market for a folding go board, be sure to add this one to your cart!</p>

[expand title=&#8221;What I Was Hoping For&#8221; trigclass=&#8221;expandTitle&#8221;]
As someone who has bought his fair share of portable go sets, the one thing I always felt was lacking was the feeling of real stones. The magnetic go sets always came with plastic stones that did the job when you had nothing else, but left me wishing I had real stones each time. And I had tried bringing my actual go stones and bowls out to coffee shops, but they were rather cumbersome and awkward to carry. In addition, I was always worried I would damage them in transit since I would be carrying them in a backpack.<br />
So when I discovered this set, I was thrilled at the idea that I might get to bring a go set with legitimate stones wherever I went. I had never owned glass/ceramic stones that were size 22 before, but I was certainly hoping that they would do the trick whenever I was on the go and in need of a go set.<br />
[/expand]
[expand title=&#8221;My Review&#8221; trigclass=&#8221;expandTitle&#8221; expanded=&#8221;true&#8221;]
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2013/11/gobentobox02.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-4308" alt="gobentobox02" src="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2013/11/gobentobox02.jpg?resize=320%2C240" width="320" height="240" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>Since it&#8217;s been awhile since I reviewed equipment last, we start with the product in all its glory! Once you take it out of the box, you have the following:<br />
<figure id="attachment_4310" style="width: 320px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2013/11/gobentobox03.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-4310 " alt="gobentobox03" src="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2013/11/gobentobox03.jpg?resize=320%2C240" width="320" height="240" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">The product prior to opening the lid. (For those noticing the yellow tint, it is from the lid of the product and not lighting issues).</figcaption></figure>
As you can see, this is a set of glass Go stones, plastic bowls and a plastic Go board that pack away snugly, just like a lunch box! Very portable and very easy to hold in one had. The only downside I will say to this design however is that it does seem to lack some sort of strapping mechanism to prevent the lid from coming off in a backpack. A rubber band will do the trick, but I do wish there was something that came with the product.<br />
<figure id="attachment_4311" style="width: 320px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2013/11/gobentobox04.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-4311" alt="gobentobox04" src="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2013/11/gobentobox04.jpg?resize=320%2C240" width="320" height="240" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Bento box without the lid.</figcaption></figure>
As you can clearly see here, the 160 stones of each color fit quite comfortably in each box and do not show any signs of spilling out of the box. In addition, for those who are concerned with the fact that the set is less than the standard 361 stone set, keep in mind that most go games are less than 300 moves. So though it might seem like &#8220;less,&#8221; this set will actually be more than adequate 99% of the time.<br />
<figure id="attachment_4312" style="width: 320px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2013/11/gobentobox05.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-4312" alt="gobentobox05" src="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2013/11/gobentobox05.jpg?resize=320%2C240" width="320" height="240" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Side angle shot of bowls and stones to show that there is a nice depth to them that reminds you of a bowl.</figcaption></figure>
One of the things I disliked about other portable sets was the lack of dipping my hand into a bowl to grab a stone. Either the plastic bowls were way too shallow, or the stones were in a bag which did not really replicate the feeling very well. So even though this is a portable set, there is still enough depth to provide the &#8220;bowl-like&#8221; feeling (which was very much appreciated).<br />
<figure id="attachment_4313" style="width: 320px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2013/11/gobentobox06.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-4313" alt="gobentobox06" src="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2013/11/gobentobox06.jpg?resize=320%2C426" width="320" height="426" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">The primary contents of the go bento box (2 lids, 2 bowls and the respective stones).</figcaption></figure>
As you can see above, the primary components of this set are the 2 bowls to hold the stones, the lids, and the stones themselves. Something that people might overlook, however, is that the lids actually have another function besides providing the &#8220;bento box&#8221; shape.<br />
<figure id="attachment_4322" style="width: 320px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2013/11/gobentobox07.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-4322 " alt="gobentobox07" src="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2013/11/gobentobox07.jpg?resize=320%2C240" width="320" height="240" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">The lids double as ways to hold your captured stones when you&#8217;re on the go! They&#8217;re even color coordinated! How clever!</figcaption></figure>
The stones were overall in great condition. Unfortunately, I did receive a couple of chipped stones. There was only one that had a major chip (which was unusable) and one with a minor chip, but otherwise it was okay.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2013/11/gobentobox08.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-4317" alt="gobentobox08" src="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2013/11/gobentobox08.jpg?resize=320%2C240" width="320" height="240" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>Besides the chipped stones, the stones seem to hold up rather well. They aren&#8217;t exactly top-notch material and might damage over a long period of time, but that is only fair when you consider that you are only paying around $25 for this set.<br />
<figure id="attachment_4318" style="width: 320px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2013/11/gobentobox09.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-4318" alt="gobentobox09" src="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2013/11/gobentobox09.jpg?resize=320%2C240" width="320" height="240" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">The stones in action on my folding go board at a coffee shop!</figcaption></figure>
When it came time to using them, I have to say that they were a delight to use. Although they are not as thick as the stones that one might normally use at a go club or at home, the size and weight of the stones are more than adequate when it comes to providing that feeling of picking up and placing the go stone on the board. And as you can see in the picture above, they fit quite nicely on my <a title="Equipment Review: Folding Go Board" href="//equipment-review-folding-go-board/">folding go board</a> and look great!<br />
So at the end of the day, I have to say that <a href="http://shop.gogameguru.com/go-bento-box/?acc=e4da3b7fbbce2345d7772b0674a318d5">The Go Bento Box</a> from GoGameGuru is a great product that provides incredible value for those interested in obtaining a portable set that keeps the essence of real stones without the hefty weight and bulky items. I wouldn&#8217;t necessarily recommend it as your primary set of stones that you use at home, but when it comes to needing a set of stones on the go, this product fits the job description! Highly recommended!<br />
<em>Note: The new Go Bento Box also includes a durable, full size, crease resistant 19&#215;19 plastic Go board. Unfortunately, when I purchased this set it did not come with one; but since most of you will probably be purchasing this for the stones, I hope that you don&#8217;t mind!</em><br />

<p><span id="more-93"></span></p>
<h3>Detailed Review</h3>
<p><strong>Size &amp; Weight:</strong> The entire set is as light as a feather and easily fits in practically any bag (except possibly purses).  To further clarify, unless you have cargo pants that have massive pockets, this is not a set you can carry around with you in your pocket. And in all honesty, who wants to play on a board that is pocket size. Can you imagine how small the stones would be?!<br />
<strong>Dura­bil­ity:</strong> The entire set is made of plastic that should survive any normal wear and tear. Now granted, if a child decides to throw a tantrum and stomp all over it, I am pretty sure that your board will be demolished. In terms of the stones, you are far more likely to lose the stones before they ever break or crack. In addition, the magnetic board is adhered pretty well to the plastic; but any decent use of force will allow you to pull it off, so be careful.<br />
<strong>Usabil­ity:</strong> The overall design of the set is done well and quite pleasant to use. Due to the cost of the board however, it is to be expected that the stones are sometimes a little oddly shaped or cut slightly off. This doesn&#8217;t detract from the general usage, but can be a little aesthetically irritating to some people.<br />
Even though the set might come with a couple ill-shaped pieces with missing magnets, the value and quality of the board outmatches the price that you pay for it. Sure, there are many ways to improve the quality of the board; but I wouldn&#8217;t hold my breath for a portable go set with the quality and value of a true wood / stone go set. The purpose of this set is for recreational play during travel as opposed to serious play during tournament, so be sure to have the right expectations when you order this set.</p>
