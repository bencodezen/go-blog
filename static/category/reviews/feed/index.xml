[expand title=&#8221;My Review&#8221; trigclass=&#8221;expandTitle&#8221; expanded=&#8221;true&#8221;]
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p><em>The Basic Principles of the Opening and the Middle Game</em>, by Rob can Zeijst and Richard Bozulich, is the second volume to Kiseido’s new series: The Road Map to Shodan. Though the title might lead some astray, this book is not intended to be a definitive guide to all principles in regards to the opening and middle game. Instead, it would be more accurate to view the purpose of this book as a broad survey of common principles that beginner and intermediate players forget during their own games. And while some might write this book off as a simple marketing ploy, this book is truly a fantastic collection of principles that cover a wide range of material in an easy to understand manner.</p>
<h3>Summary of Content</h3>
<p>When first presented with the title, I must admit that I was initially skeptical of what it could contain. After all, I had already read 20 Principles of the Opening, Get Strong at the Opening, 501 Opening Problems, etc. To my delight, the content of the book exceeded my expectations. Just look at the topics covered: (1) Extensions and Efficiency, (2) Confinement, Linkage, and Separation, (3) Weak Stones and Weak Positions, (4) Handling Moyos &amp; Escaping, (5) Handling Thickness, (6) The Third and Fourth Lines in the Opening, (7) Defending Against a 3-3 Invasion, (8) Turning a Moyo into Territory, and (9) How to Make Sabaki.<br />
While the topics do not receive a comprehensive explanation of each topic, the book does a great job providing a survey of the topic with the key points highlighted. After all, don’t forget that this series is meant to be a guide for those who are kyu players looking to gain strength. So the most effective method for helping players do that is to provide the most common mistakes that players make and how to fix them. More advanced techniques and principles would naturally be reserved for other books.<br />
Unlike most of the other books I have read, this book does an excellent job of keeping things as simple as possible. For example, instead of inundating the reader with numerous of examples taken from professional games, the examples consist of straight-forward examples that are easy to follow. In addition, each principle is given a good mixture of examples and explanation. As a result, novice and/or more casual players would not be overwhelmed and can digest the material much more easily.</p>
<h3>Intended Audience</h3>
<p>The strength of players who would benefit most from this book would be around 10k and stronger.<br />
While there are other books out there that contain similar information in various forms, this book is best suited for players who approach the study of go with a more casual approach.<br />
In other words, the material is written in such a way that it is quite easy to get through and absorb without multiple intense readings. That’s not to say that you can read it once and be done with it, but it is not so dense that you would have to reread a paragraph multiple times just to understand its basic meaning (let alone trying to apply it in your own games). In addition, the diagrams are short enough that it is not necessary to have a board in order to comprehend the flow of the stones (though it is certainly recommended if you have it in front of you).</p>
<h3>Layout</h3>
<p>The content is laid out in a way that is analogous to a textbook. First you have a section explaining the principles that you should learn along with a few examples to illustrate their point. The explanations are then followed up with a few problems for you to reinforce what you have just learned. And to ensure that you don’t accidentally glance at the solutions while trying to solve the problems, they are kept in a separate section after the problems are presented.</p>
<h3>Analysis and Evaluation</h3>
<p>The key to understanding the brilliance of this book lies in its accessibility to players of all kinds. Even when I consider players like myself who have read numerous books and take the game quite seriously, there is something to be appreciated about the simplicity to which this book approaches the topic. And though my understanding of this topic most likely has already encroached on dan territory, I still felt that the book provided a great reinforcement of things I knew and helped fill some areas that I didn’t realize were missing.<br />
In terms of shortcomings, there is only one aspect that I would have liked to have seen: more practice problems. While there are a handful of problems to review each section, there was more than one occasion where I would have liked just a few more problems. To be clear though, this is not to say that the problems in the book do not cover the topics presented. It’s just I would have liked a few more than what is in the book.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>While there will be players who may scoff at this book, Kiseido has done a great job of finally providing a stepping stone that beginner and intermediate players can actually benefit from. So if you have any interest in the topics mentioned above and think you could benefit from the style of teaching being used, then I highly recommend that you get a copy of this book pronto!<br />

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/09/thedivinemovemovie.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-5625" src="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/09/thedivinemovemovie-209x300.jpg?resize=209%2C300" alt="thedivinemovemovie" width="209" height="300" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><br />
When I first saw the trailer for this movie, there were two things that I noticed: go and martial arts. And as someone who grew up on kung fu movies and watching subtitled Asian movies, I was sold immediately.<br />
One of my concerns was that I would have to find some bootleg version of the movie online or wait forever to buy the DVD and have it shipped to the U.S. However, fortunately they had a limited theatrical release in the United States and one of the theaters was only about a 35 min drive away from me. Awesome!<br />
In case you’re planning on seeing it soon and don’t want to have any of my opinion impact your viewing of the movie, I will just say that I recommend you check it out. The only word of caution I would advise is for people who are squeamish about blood and violence. It’s not anything horrific or terribly gory (like a horror movie), but it’s certainly not completely sugar coated (like some martial art movies where the people never bleed or have injuries).<br />
If you’d like to hear a bit more opinionated review, read on!<br />
<span id="more-5624"></span><br />
So while I refuse to give away any plot details since I hate when people give spoilers, here’s what I will say about it.</p>
<ol>
<li>Overall, the movie had elements that reminded me of “The Count of Monte Cristo,” “Ocean’s 11,” and “Thai Warrior.”</li>
<li>I was worried that it would end up being an action movie with only a splash of go, but the theme of go was central to the entire movie and there was very few scenes where there were no references to go or some aspect of it.</li>
<li>My younger brother (who does not play go) really enjoyed it and even has some interest to learn some more about it now.</li>
</ol>
<p>In regards to the blood and violence, I will stress again that this movie is a bit more bloody and violent than I anticipated. In most martial arts movies (that I grew up watching), there was not much blood and blatant violence (like someone’s finger being broken while being tortured). However, it doesn’t even come close to what I’ve seen/heard about in horror movies in regards to gore and violence (i.e., there are no scenes of people’s heads getting sliced off or scenes of a person being gutted and the insides spewing out). In fact, the violence is used more as a means of showing the pain the characters are going through instead of for sheer gore factor.<br />
Overall, I had a great time watching the movie and enjoyed it. I’m sure that a movie connoisseur can pick the movie apart for X, Y, and Z reasons; but if you approach the movie as a story centered around go while having martial arts and showing some cultural insight into the gambling go scene in Korea, it should be an enjoyable watch.<br />
Definitely a movie I would recommend and one that I hope to add to my collection in the near future!</p>

<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>With one month of <a title="Yunguseng Dojang Official Site" href="http://www.yunguseng.com/">Yunguseng Dojang</a> (YSD) in my pocket, I was ready to take on this next month with a whole new perspective. However, this month would not be the bright new sunshine that I thought it would be.<br />
<span id="more-5515"></span></p>
<h2 id="lecturesamphomework">Lectures &amp; Homework</h2>
<p>For this month, the three lecture topics were:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://ayd.yunguseng.com/videos/index.php?id=1219">Analyze the most often played patterns: Star point chapter</a></li>
<li><a href="http://ayd.yunguseng.com/videos/index.php?id=1256">Analyze the most often played patterns: 3–4 point chapter</a></li>
<li><a href="http://ayd.yunguseng.com/videos/index.php?id=1296">Approach to the 4–4 enclosed corner</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Though I didn’t get a chance to watch all the lectures, the material that I did watch and study contained very pertinent information in common patterns that typically appear in games.</p>
<h2 id="mygames">My Games</h2>
<h3 id="round6" style="text-align: center;">Round 6</h3>
<p><strong>Preliminary Thoughts</strong> &#8211; With my first match being against my friend nadoss, I was a little nervous since I always feel kind of weird when playing a friend in a competitive nature where something is at stake (i.e., our rank in YSD). In addition, I knew that nadoss could play at a level higher than his rank, so I was trying hard to remember not to take him lightly.<br />

<p><strong>After the Game</strong> &#8211; While I managed to win, it was a victory of mixed feelings. On the one hand, I was glad to win the first round of month 2, but on the other hand, I did not feel like I played as well I could have.<br />
<strong>After the Review</strong> &#8211; Overall I wasn’t criticized too much for my play, but there were certainly mistakes here and there. I think the only thing I did well was being able to keep a whole board focus for some of the critical points in the game. However, this is not something I feel any pride in because there is a 5 stone difference between us anyways.</p>
<h3 id="round7" style="text-align: center;">Round 7</h3>
<p><strong>Preliminary Thoughts</strong> &#8211; This week I’m playing a 5 kyu. For some reason, playing even games against players with a lower rank than me by 2 stones or more makes me nervous. I guess I’m worried that I’ll get overconfident and underestimate my opponent, and then lose!! Haha. Ah well, just have to remember to play the best moves I possibly can. As long as I do that, I’m hoping I’ll have no regrets.<br />

<p><strong>After the Game</strong> &#8211; The game ended up boiling down to a huge capturing race. It wasn’t necessary, but I got it in my head that it was time for White to die and I nearly killed myself in the process. Completely unnecessary and a poor decision on my part. On top of that, I even proudly played an empty triangle because I thought it was the firmest way to kill. <em>hangs head in shame</em><br />
<strong>After the Review</strong> &#8211; Inseong essentially confirmed my thoughts on the game. In fact, if anything there was probably more negative things to say about the game than positive. I was just fortunate that my slack moves were not punished properly. I really need to work on my mindset when playing people a couple stones or more weaker than I am…</p>
<h3 id="round8" style="text-align: center;">Round 8</h3>
<p><strong>Preliminary Thoughts</strong> &#8211; Prior to playing this game, I went on a 5 game losing streak* that very day. I was in the worst of moods and clearly on tilt. So as I geared up to play the 4k of our group, part of me flinched at the idea since my last loss was to a 4k as well. And I know that my opponent was no ordinary 4k, so as I prepared to challenge him to our match, I couldn’t help but feel some dread at adding a 6th loss to my day.<br />
*<em>And if you’re wondering how bad it was, my rank dropped from 2k to 4k. Yup. That bad.</em><br />

<p><strong>After the Game</strong> &#8211; I can’t believe I won. When I was counting towards the end, I was pretty sure I was behind by like 10 points (although I will admit I completely forgot I had komi, but nonetheless I would have still been behind according to my rough estimates). While a relief in one respect, it definitely felt like a growing moment as the game was very different from my normal aggressive game. It was surprisingly calm.<br />
<strong>After the Review</strong> &#8211; Overall the review went pretty well. I missed a couple of key points that would have been pretty bad for me if my opponent was able to see it at the time; but there wasn’t anything overly critical. So all in all, I’m pretty happy with the result of the game and my ability to stay in control till the very end (considering how bent up I was at the time).</p>
<h3 id="round9" style="text-align: center;">Round 9</h3>
<p><strong>Preliminary Thoughts</strong> &#8211; Tonight’s opponent is one that I was rather worried about because he had an atypical playing style. In summary, he was very comfortable using 5–3 as one of his opening moves. Being as how I have little experience with it, I was admittedly worried. So while I did try to read up on 5–3 a little bit, I didn’t feel as prepared as I would have liked before playing this game.<br />

<p><strong>After the Game</strong> &#8211; Losing the game was rough because it meant that I was not guaranteed a promotion anymore. In addition, I thought that I was in control for a good portion of the game; but ended up giving up away too much in the center and lost. Sigh. Frustrated for sure…<br />
<strong>After the Review</strong> &#8211; Sometimes the most frustrating thing is knowing you were right about being in control for a good portion of the game. And then when you make one single error that goofs up your entire advantage…. Argh! Makes you just want to throw your hands up in disbelief at your own incompetence… Although on an interesting note, I was very close to discovering a tesuji that would have allowed me to win the game. So that&#8217;s pretty cool.</p>
<h3 id="round10" style="text-align: center;">Round 10</h3>
<p><strong>Preliminary Thoughts</strong> &#8211; Once again, I was put in the position of having my final match be the determining factor between whether I get promoted or not. Sigh. And on top of that, I was fighting a slump so the pressure was not helping at all…<br />

<p><strong>After the Game</strong> &#8211; I lost… Once again… I choked at the final moment and loss. Just no words at this time. Can’t even stay for the review because of how frustrated I am with my go.<br />
<strong>After the Review</strong> &#8211; It wasn’t until a few days later that I finally sat down to watch the review. To my surprise, sabum-nim actually had mostly positive things to say about my gameplay. Granted, in the end my opponent triumphed and destroyed me; but at least the game wasn’t hopeless. So while I was really bummed out after the game, I’m at least glad that the review wasn’t as horrible as I thought it would be.</p>
<h2 id="finalthoughts">Final Thoughts</h2>
<p>This has been a rough month for me, but a lot of it has to do with other factors and not so much with YSD itself. The YSD games certainly showed my decline and poor play over the month, but they are certainly not to blame. At the bare minimum, I am at least grateful to Inseong for his reviews and insights so that I can patch up my mistakes and continue getting stronger. Here’s to hoping next month is better.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Part I</strong> &#8211; <a title="My Experience with YSD — S9 — Part 2" href="//experience-ysd-s9-part-2/">Part II</a> &#8211; Part III</p>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p><em>Prelude: Out of respect to Sabum-nim (i.e., In-seong), the lessons learned are kept to a minimum since it is paid content and I do not want to infringe on that in any way, shape, or form. The game reviews also only contain highlights of concise highlights instead of my normal detailed reviews since I would inadvertently write about what Sabum-nim taught in the review (which would essentially replicate his lecture). </em><br />
As a new member to the <a title="Yunguseng Dojang Official Site" href="http://www.yunguseng.com/">Yunguseng Dojang</a> (YSD) during Season 9 of 2014, I was assigned to League A as my starting league (this is the highest league possible in the American division). I wasn&#8217;t sure what I was to expect, but I was excited at the prospect at being part of a formal training program.<br />
<span id="more-5395"></span></p>
<h2>Lectures &amp; Homework</h2>
<p>For this month, the three lecture topics were:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="http://ayd.yunguseng.com/videos/index.php?id=1138">Knight move across attachment / Break the dog&#8217;s face / Indirect defense</a></li>
<li><a title="1-3-5 Opening Link" href="http://ayd.yunguseng.com/videos/index.php?id=1156">1-3-5 opening</a></li>
<li><a title="All About 3-3 Invasion Link" href="http://ayd.yunguseng.com/videos/index.php?id=1174">All about 3-3 invasion</a></li>
</ol>
<p>Overall, I felt that Sabum-nim was very good at selecting topics that were relevant to his students. After watching his student&#8217;s play their games, he would often notice trends that were occurring and would then select lecture topics to address them.<br />
In addition, the lectures were much more valuable if you could attend them in person because he made them interactive. There were usually numerous examples to show what he was trying to illustrate and to give the students a chance to show whether or not they understood what was being taught.<br />
Unfortunately, I was didn&#8217;t end up participating in the second aspect of lectures which were the homework (which consists of taking what you learned in the lecture and applying it to your own games). I&#8217;m sure I could come up with some bogus excuse for why I couldn&#8217;t do it, but it was my own fault and I plan to do every homework next month.<br />
Finally, another thing cool thing that Sabum-nim does is a lecture series that highlights the most important points from the games played that week (from both Europe and America division). It&#8217;s a cool series that has a lot of concise highlights and cool techniques that came up in actual games.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;">My Games</h2>
<h3 style="text-align: center;">Round 1</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Preliminary Thoughts</strong> &#8211; As this was the first game I would play in YSD, I felt a lot of pressure to try and play the best go I possibly could. To top it off, my opponent was known as one of the strongest players in the league, so I was more anxious than I would&#8217;ve liked. And so one of the things I did was to play out the game on a real board simultaneously. By doing so, I was hoping it would calm me down.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>After the Game</strong> &#8211; Playing the game out on a real board ended up helping me calm down, but it also led to me being more adventurous/experimental and to also lose on time. When the pop-up flashed, &#8220;bengozen loses on time,&#8221; I sat there flustered as I tried to collect myself in thinking that at least I played a good game.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>After the Review</strong> &#8211; Turns out I was wrong on all counts. Not only was I not complimented on my play, but I was shown how badly I should have lost. I made numerous mistakes and deserved to lose (even regardless of time). Sigh. Definitely did not make the good impression I wanted to make on Sabum-nim.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: center;">Round 2</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Preliminary Thoughts</strong> &#8211; Since my last game was so disastrous, I was eager to yet again prove myself. Similar to the first match however, my opponent was considered one of the strongest players in the league as well, so there was a bit of pressure to try and do well against the veteran.</p>

<div id='glift_display7' style='height:500px; width:100%; position:relative;'></div>
<script type='text/javascript'>gliftWidget = glift.create({"divId":"glift_display7","sgf":"http:\/\/bengozen.com\/\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/06\/YSD-S9-Round2.sgf","display":{"theme":"DEFAULT","drawBoardCoords":"1"}});</script>

<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>After the Game</strong> &#8211; Though I lost my Round 1 game in part due to experimenting, I still ended up doing it again this round. And just like before, I lost again. I was really starting to doubt my abilities as a player and whether I even belonged in League A.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>After the Review</strong> &#8211; Similar to the Round 1, I didn&#8217;t play particularly well this game either. The only reprieve that I got was that the game resulted in a fun reading problem on the bottom that Sabum-nim liked. Otherwise than that though, I was still feeling pretty crappy about my performance so far.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: center;">Round 3</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Preliminary Thoughts</strong> &#8211; Seeing as how I had lost my last two games, I had much lower expectations of myself this time around. I really had no idea if I was going to win. If anything, I was simply hoping I wouldn&#8217;t play another game that would add another mark of disappointment to Sabum-nim&#8217;s impression of me.</p>

<div id='glift_display8' style='height:500px; width:100%; position:relative;'></div>
<script type='text/javascript'>gliftWidget = glift.create({"divId":"glift_display8","sgf":"http:\/\/bengozen.com\/\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/06\/YSD-S9-Round3.sgf","display":{"theme":"DEFAULT","drawBoardCoords":"1"}});</script>

<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>After the Game</strong> &#8211; The game was still a rather weird one for me. Still a lot more experimenting than I necessarily would have wanted, but it seemed I was not destined to play games that were in my comfort range. Luckily for me though, I was able to secure an advantage early on that allowed me to win the game.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>After the Review</strong> &#8211; Though this was my first win for YSD, the review still felt a bit mediocre for me overall. What I remember feeling like is that I was really only able to win because of my opponent&#8217;s overplay early on. Otherwise however, it wasn&#8217;t a particularly good game for me either.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: center;">Round 4</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Preliminary Thoughts</strong> &#8211; I was unable to make the original time scheduled for Round 4, but I was lucky that my opponent could reschedule to the prior Sunday. Unfortunately, unlike my previous games, I was unable to play in a focused state of mind because I was at a local Starbucks and had a lot of other work needed to be done. So I was unable to give this game my all like I normally would.</p>

<div id='glift_display9' style='height:500px; width:100%; position:relative;'></div>
<script type='text/javascript'>gliftWidget = glift.create({"divId":"glift_display9","sgf":"http:\/\/bengozen.com\/\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/06\/YSD-S9-Round4.sgf","display":{"theme":"DEFAULT","drawBoardCoords":"1"}});</script>

<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>After the Game</strong> &#8211; After my opponent resigned, I breathed a sigh of relief; but I was not terribly proud of the game that I had just played. After looking back over it, it was a haphazard game that I was lucky to win only because my opponent made a mistake and I got away with a few overplays that allowed me to reverse the game in my favor. So even though I won, it felt more like I had loss since my play was rather disappointing.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>After the Review</strong> &#8211; Continuing the trend of being a disappointment, Sabum-nim was quick to show how I was able to get away with numerous overplays in order to win the game. &#8220;This wasn&#8217;t supposed to work. And then that wasn&#8217;t supposed to work.&#8221; Although this time around, I knew that my play was rather abysmal since I was unable to give it my all at the time; so I was accepting of his criticism.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: center;">Round 5</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Preliminary Thoughts</strong> &#8211; With my record at 2-2, my ability to stay in League A rested on this final match. And so the pressure was particularly high for this game since I was unsure if I would be able to pull it off and the idea of being demoted terrified me. On top of all of that, it was against a friend who I&#8217;ve gotten to know quite well over the last few weeks, so it was a mixed bag of emotions as we dove into the epic clash that would determine my fate.</p>

<div id='glift_display10' style='height:500px; width:100%; position:relative;'></div>
<script type='text/javascript'>gliftWidget = glift.create({"divId":"glift_display10","sgf":"http:\/\/bengozen.com\/\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/06\/YSD-S9-Round5.sgf","display":{"theme":"DEFAULT","drawBoardCoords":"1"}});</script>

<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>After the Game</strong> &#8211; After clicking the resign button, I knew my fate was sealed. I was rather downtrodden, but there was a part of me that actually felt really good about the game. Unlike the other games, though I was <a title="My First Demotion" href="//first-demotion/">wrestling with disappointment of demotion at the time</a>, I actually felt like this game was something I could actually be proud of.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>After the Review </strong>&#8211; Finally, after four weeks of being a disappointment, I felt like I was finally able to play a game that Sabum-nim actually approved of. Of course as expected, I made a number of mistakes, but it felt like maybe I had finally played a game worthy of Sabum-nim&#8217;s time and energy. And on top of that, I felt start to awaken inside of me as a result of that game; but more on that later.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;">Final Thoughts</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">When I first learned about how YSD worked, I have to admit that I thought 5 games a month would be a piece of cake. In reality, it is actually more difficult than it sounds since the games often take more than 90 minutes to complete and are scheduled. And well, you all know how life likes to get in the way of things. Nonetheless, I was really grateful that the program spurred us on to play more since that was one of my weaker areas at the time.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">As I look back at my thoughts after the reviews, I just wanted to clarify that Sabum-nim is really not an overly harsh or mean teacher. He simply tells it as it is without sugar-coating things since his goal is to teach you where your mistakes are and not to coddle you. In addition, it&#8217;s important to keep in mind that a major component to how I felt after each review derives from the fact that I am extremely self-critical of myself. So what else could you expect from someone rubbing salt into their own wounds? Haha.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">And though I was more disappointed and frustrated about being demoted to League B than I probably should have been, my exposure to League A was a great experience to show the gaps in my skills as a go player. I don&#8217;t know what is in store for me in League B, but I look forward to the challenge of climbing back up to League A. Until next month!</p>

[expand title=&#8221;Before I Read This Book&#8230;&#8221; trigclass=&#8221;expandTitle&#8221;]
As an enthusiast of the &#8220;Graded Go Problems for Beginners&#8221; series, I have to say that I was ecstatic when I heard about this series. After all, every kyu player dreams of making it to the big dan league and being able to solve &#8220;dan level&#8221; problems. And even though I got myself a copy of this book quite a while ago, this book seemed quite daunting to me for some time due to the fact that I just felt I wasn&#8217;t ready for &#8220;dan&#8221; problems. Anyhow, I&#8217;m glad I finally got around to reading it so that you can hear my thoughts on the book itself.<br />
[/expand]
[expand title=&#8221;My Review&#8221; trigclass=&#8221;expandTitle&#8221; expanded=&#8221;true&#8221;]
Perhaps my favorite aspect about the entire &#8220;Graded Go Problems&#8221; series as a whole is the extremely clean format. For those who don&#8217;t know what I&#8217;m talking about, every page that contains the problems is divided into four clean and even rectangles. Secondly, the numbering, diagram, directions, and even hints are all in universal places so that once you get exposed to the format, you&#8217;ll never wonder where to look next. And last but not least, the solutions are never exposed on the same page (aka you can&#8217;t see the solution as you&#8217;re trying to solve the problem). And thankfully, Graded Go Problems for Dan Players continues that tradition.<br />
One of the new things I noticed with this series is that they added an actual rank estimation for the problem difficulty. So a few examples of this might include: &#8220;Solve at a glance = 4-kyu, Solve within five minutes = 3-dan, etc.&#8221; While this is rather neat since you feel a sense of accomplishment if you&#8217;re able to solve it within the allotted time-frame, it&#8217;s important to realize that these rank estimations are a bit arbitrary. Just because you&#8217;re able to solve a few dan level problems at a glance does not necessarily mean you are &#8220;dan&#8221; level (whether it&#8217;s reading ability or playing ability). If you&#8217;re able to solve the whole book at a glance though, then it goes without saying you are way stronger than a dan player. xD<br />
When it comes to the solutions, they have a set standard format for how solutions are displayed and approached. In terms of basic format, every problem gets three solution diagrams. This generally includes the correct variation, an alternate variation / continuation of the correct variation, and an incorrect variation. In addition, there is usually at least a sentence to two explaining each of the variations in order to help the reader understand what&#8217;s going on.<br />
If there were to be any complaint about this series, it would probably be that the problems are not segmented into different techniques. However, I would remind the reader that the purpose of this series is to provide a collection of high-quality problems. As a result, the problems would be an assortment of different problems as opposed to a hierarchy of problems broken down by techniques. If you&#8217;re looking for problems categorized in such a fashion, you might benefit from checking out the Level Up Series along with Life and Death Problems 1 Basics by Robert Jasiek.<br />
Overall, I think that this series is destined for the same greatness as the &#8220;Graded for Go Problems for Beginners&#8221; when it comes to high quality problems that are displayed in an easy to read format. Definitely a must-have for any player serious about practicing their reading and looking for ways to keep honing their ability. Highly recommended!<br />

<p><strong>Description:</strong> &#8220;Are you looking for an affordable Go set? Look no further. The Dirt Cheap Go Set is a complete, full size Go game set at an unbeatable price! Each set includes one foldable 19&#215;19 plastic Go board, 180 Go stones of each color (black and white) and two plastic Go bowls. Because the board can be folded and sealed tightly inside one of the bowls (with the stones) this set is also compact and portable.&#8221; &#8211; GoGameGuru<br />

[expand title=&#8221;My Review&#8221; trigclass=&#8221;expandTitle&#8221; expanded=&#8221;true&#8221;]
As always, we start with the product itself!<br />
<figure id="attachment_4605" style="width: 490px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/02/dirtcheapgoset02.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-4605" alt="dirtcheapgoset02" src="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/02/dirtcheapgoset02.jpg?resize=490%2C368" width="490" height="368" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">For those wondering what language is on the box, it&#8217;s Simplified Chinese.</figcaption></figure>
<figure id="attachment_4606" style="width: 490px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/02/dirtcheapgoset03.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-4606" alt="dirtcheapgoset03" src="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/02/dirtcheapgoset03.jpg?resize=490%2C368" width="490" height="368" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Box wide open!</figcaption></figure>
The following picture shows the contents of the box: the plastic go board and the go bowls (with the stones inside).</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/02/dirtcheapgoset04.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-4607" alt="dirtcheapgoset04" src="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/02/dirtcheapgoset04.jpg?resize=490%2C368" width="490" height="368" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Before opening the bowls, I was expecting the stones to be in their respective colored bowl; but this is nice in its own way since it provides contrast when looking into the bowl for stones. When I did open them though, I will have to say that a strong plastic / crayon like smell immediately hit me (which was rather unpleasant). So if you&#8217;re buying this for kids, please open it yourself and rinse the stones and wash it before you give it to them.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/02/dirtcheapgoset05.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-4608" alt="dirtcheapgoset05" src="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/02/dirtcheapgoset05.jpg?resize=490%2C368" width="490" height="368" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">In the next image, you&#8217;ll see a close-up of the stones (which are mono-convex). You&#8217;ll notice they are slightly grainy due to the material it&#8217;s made out of and different from say glass stones.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/02/dirtcheapgoset06.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-4609" alt="dirtcheapgoset06" src="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/02/dirtcheapgoset06.jpg?resize=490%2C368" width="490" height="368" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Here is the board fully unfolded. You can see that it&#8217;s kind of wrinkled, but this is to be expected since this is a plastic board that is stored by folding it. And as you might expect, it is lightweight and would easily fly away if nothing was on it and the wind was blowing.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/02/dirtcheapgoset07.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-4610" alt="dirtcheapgoset07" src="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/02/dirtcheapgoset07.jpg?resize=490%2C368" width="490" height="368" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Here are some shots of the board in action. Overall, it&#8217;s a pleasure to use and you&#8217;ll notice looks quite nice overall. The stones are a bit light for my liking, but one cannot expect too much for a go set that totals are $15 and is lightweight and portable. =D</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/02/dirtcheapgoset08.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-4611" alt="dirtcheapgoset08" src="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/02/dirtcheapgoset08.jpg?resize=490%2C368" width="490" height="368" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/02/dirtcheapgoset09.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-4612" alt="dirtcheapgoset09" src="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/02/dirtcheapgoset09.jpg?resize=490%2C368" width="490" height="368" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">This set is definitely a great one for those looking to start a go club and who needs a large number of sets while being on a budget. However, if you can just save a little bit more or are looking to buy an affordable set while not breaking the bank, I would recommend checking out the <a title="Equipment Review: The Go Bento Box" href="//equipment-review-go-bento-box/">Go Game Bento Box</a>. Hope that this review has helped!</p>

[expand title=&#8221;My Review&#8221; trigclass=&#8221;expandTitle&#8221; expanded=&#8221;true&#8221;]
Like many other players, when I first saw the title of this book, I wanted to get my hands on it as soon as I possibly could. However, while the idea of having all of the &#8220;fighting fundamentals&#8221; covered in a single book sounds enticing and attractive, there is way more than meets the eye.<br />
In order to understand my review on the book and how it relates to you, it is critical to first emphasize the following: fighting is a complicated topic. And when I say complicated, I mean it is probably by far the most complex and intricate of all the topics in go. Other things in go like joseki and fuseki can be explained rather simply with relative ease. Fighting, however, is a far more difficult animal to tackle. As a result, the thing I want you to realize from the get go is that fighting in go does not fit into easy principles like &#8220;approach from the wider side&#8221; the way you want it to.<br />
Secondly, I want to clearly state that my learning style is perhaps different than the average go player. If I were to use the analogy of a bird learning how to fly, I would have to say that there are a number of people out there who would learn flying methodically. In other words, they might learn to flap their wings first, and then maybe learn about air currents and how they impact flight patterns, etc. However, I am more of the jump out of the nest and learn to fly on the way down kind of person. I prefer experience and practical application over deep theories that require significant time of study.<br />
With that said, Jasiek has done a great job in producing the first English go book to really try and approach this monstrosity of a topic. As you can see from the table of contents, there are so many different aspects of fighting that Jasiek covers. And to be honest, I wouldn&#8217;t be surprised if there were a lot more that could be written on. However, as far as my personal experience goes, I have to say that working through the book felt a lot like the time I took organic chemistry in college.<br />
What do I mean by that? Well, at the very fundamental level, I accepted and understood the basic logic behind what was being taught. There were rules and general principles that applied to why things worked the way they did. Before I knew it though, I was drowning in a sea of different theories, terms and intricacies that overwhelmed my brain and it didn&#8217;t take long before I started losing interest. &#8220;If you attack here, you must keep in mind of X; but also realize that Y might impact Z in a way that implicates the life of X and Y.&#8221; *dizzy*<br />
The thing to realize is this: fighting is complicated. And while Jasiek has done a great job trying to organize it into different sections and try to break everything down into principles, it doesn&#8217;t change the fact that fighting is a multi-faceted skill that will not improve simply because you read a book. There are so many aspects that go into it: your reading ability, your positional judgment ability, your life and death, etc. So unless those are up to par, fighting will still seem like a chaotic whirlwind that you won&#8217;t be able to make much sense of.<br />
At the end of the day, while I personally had a difficult time absorbing the material in the book, this book is truly a milestone for Western go literature in its effort to pioneer a way for us to learn about fighting. And to be honest, I think that I might just be a weird outlier who doesn&#8217;t have the diligence or tenacity to absorb the material. So if even a small part of you believes that you have the personality and learning style suited to benefiting from this book, then I would disregard my experience of the book and recommend you get it whenever possible.<br />
[/expand]
[expand title=&#8221;Synopsis&#8221; trigclass=&#8221;expandTitle&#8221;]
<strong>What did I enjoy about the book?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>There are lots of examples throughout the book.</li>
<li>Utilizes typographic elements like bullet points and bold to emphasize its points.</li>
<li>A very thorough breakdown of topics that fit together well logistically.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What did I gain from reading this book?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Realization that I am a far cry from being able to truly grasp and apply the material in the book.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What is the format of the book?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Textbook. Concepts are introduced and are accompanied by numerous examples along with a few practice problems at the end of each section as well.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What aspects can be improved on?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>I am only commenting on this from a weak amateur perspective, but the information was very difficult to process as a whole for myself. And to be fair, I recognize that this book is an important step to creating a more &#8220;user-friendly&#8221; version of teaching fighting principles, but overall I had a harder time working through and learning with this book due to my learning style.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Is this book easy to read?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>There is so much information in this book that it is not easy to gloss through at all. It definitely reads more like an academic textbook that requires slow and deliberate reading. Almost as if you were taking a course and you were trying to memorize all the different theories and how they fit together.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Bottom Line</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>A great first milestone for Western literature on the topic of fighting.</li>
<li>Suited for players who are very studious and enjoy learning through an intricate textbook.</li>
<li>Not recommended for players looking to get a light overview of fighting.</li>
</ol>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Slate and Shell Go Stones &#8211; Sample Pack &#8211; Size 36 Biconvex</h2>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> &#8220;This is a sample pack of our size 36 slate and shell Go stones, which are among the highest quality Go stones available. It contains three black stones and three white stones. Size 36 refers to the thickness of the stone (in this case 10.4 mm or 0.41 inches). The additional thickness and weight of these stones gives them a pleasant feeling in your hand and produces a sharp and satisfying snapping sound when the stones are played.&#8221; &#8211; GoGameGuru<br />

<strong>What&#8217;s the best aspect about this product?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>It&#8217;s slate and shell. &#8216;Nuff said.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What is the weakest aspect of this product?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Size 36 is pretty big, so if someone is not accounting for it, their board might seem a bit crowded if the board is not drawn to accommodate for it.</li>

<li>It&#8217;s slate and shell. Haha. I&#8217;d recommend you handle with care.</li>

[expand title=&#8221;My Review&#8221; trigclass=&#8221;expandTitle&#8221; expanded=&#8221;true&#8221;]
The sample comes in a nice little cloth bag with the BadukBrother logo clearly marked.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/02/slateshellsample02.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-4594" alt="slateshellsample02" src="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/02/slateshellsample02.jpg?resize=490%2C368" width="490" height="368" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">When you remove the stones from the bag, you can see that it is in a nice plastic bag (which provides the actual protection in shipping).</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/02/slateshellsample03.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-4595" alt="slateshellsample03" src="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/02/slateshellsample03.jpg?resize=368%2C490" width="368" height="490" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">With the stones removed, you can see them glistening in the light. Very pretty. =)</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/02/slateshellsample04.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-4596" alt="slateshellsample04" src="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/02/slateshellsample04.jpg?resize=490%2C368" width="490" height="368" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The one thing I will say is that the beautiful pattern you are used to seeing on shell stones was harder to capture in the pictures. I think that this is due to the fact that the size of the stones (and for those who don&#8217;t know, size 36 is pretty large) and that this is a sample pack is a reason for why the pattern is more faded compared to the set that I own. However, since this is not a full set, I would not take this as an alarming fact since your purpose with this sample pack is to really get a feel for slate and shell as opposed to just the look.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/02/slateshellsample05.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-4597" alt="slateshellsample05" src="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/02/slateshellsample05.jpg?resize=490%2C368" width="490" height="368" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">At the end of the day, they arrived in perfect condition which is precisely what someone needs when they want to find out if they really want to own a set of slate and shell. If you&#8217;re interested in getting a slate and shell stone set but worried if the value is worth the price, be sure to grab one of these sample packs from GoGameGuru to help you make an informed decision. Good luck!</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">PS. I do own a full set of slate and shell stones, so let me know if you ever have any questions.</p>

<li>A great go board for someone on a budget!</li>

[/expand]
[expand title=&#8221;My Review&#8221; trigclass=&#8221;expandTitle&#8221; expanded=&#8221;true&#8221;]
Here&#8217;s the front of the board at a slanted angle. It&#8217;s a nice yellow color to give it a semi-shin-kaya feel. (I prefer the yellow color over brown since it shows more contrast when stones are placed on the board; but that&#8217;s just a personal preference.)</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/01/dirtcheapgoboard02.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-4544" alt="dirtcheapgoboard02" src="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/01/dirtcheapgoboard02.jpg?resize=360%2C270" width="360" height="270" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">And here below, you can see that there&#8217;s a Chinese chess board on the back!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/01/dirtcheapgoboard03.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-4545" alt="dirtcheapgoboard03" src="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/01/dirtcheapgoboard03.jpg?resize=360%2C270" width="360" height="270" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Upon closer inspection, you&#8217;ll see that the lines are not perfectly straight the way you&#8217;ll see on higher quality boards. However, I wouldn&#8217;t let this be a deterrent from purchasing the board if it&#8217;s being used for casual play.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/01/dirtcheapgoboard04.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-4546" alt="dirtcheapgoboard04" src="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/01/dirtcheapgoboard04.jpg?resize=360%2C270" width="360" height="270" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Here are a couple of shots with the board in action with my size 36 glass stones. As you can see, the lines are not so obvious from a player&#8217;s perspective.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/01/dirtcheapgoboard05.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-4547" alt="dirtcheapgoboard05" src="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/01/dirtcheapgoboard05.jpg?resize=360%2C270" width="360" height="270" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/01/dirtcheapgoboard06.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-4548" alt="dirtcheapgoboard06" src="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/01/dirtcheapgoboard06.jpg?resize=360%2C270" width="360" height="270" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>

<p style="text-align: left;">Bottom line: I highly recommend this board for people who are looking to purchase boards for their club or for tournaments. This board would also function well as a casual study/playing board. However, I would definitely not recommend this as a primary goban for anyone who is looking for that classic air and sound you get from true wooden boards. So remember, the key thing to remember is that this is a board that focuses on affordability and practicality.</p>

<strong>What&#8217;s the best aspect about this product?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Portability! It&#8217;s one of the lightest products I&#8217;ve encountered while still maintaining decent quality!</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What is the weakest aspect of this product?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>As someone who is used to using real stones, the stones can feel a bit lighter than desired; but to be honest, it beats not having any board or stones to play when you&#8217;re out and about!</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Is it durable?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The stones are plastic and should hold up well enough. The board is made of fabric so it shouldn&#8217;t tear so easily, but will probably wear out over time with use and will eventually need replacing.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Bottom Line</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Great lightweight go set for that one can easily pack without noticing any additional weight or bulkiness.</li>
<li>Recommended for any player looking to always have a go set on hand without the hassle or concern over the safety of a wooden board or real stones.</li>

[expand title=&#8221;My Review&#8221; trigclass=&#8221;expandTitle&#8221; expanded=&#8221;true&#8221;]
True to their word, this featherweight go set came packed in a super light way with no bulky boxes!<br />
<figure id="attachment_4492" style="width: 360px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/01/featherweightgoset02.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-4492" alt="featherweightgoset02" src="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/01/featherweightgoset02.jpg?resize=360%2C270" width="360" height="270" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">As you can see, everything fits in one bag!</figcaption></figure>
<figure id="attachment_4493" style="width: 360px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/01/featherweightgoset03.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-4493" alt="featherweightgoset03" src="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/01/featherweightgoset03.jpg?resize=360%2C270" width="360" height="270" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Contents of the bag: two bags of stones and one board</figcaption></figure>
<figure id="attachment_4494" style="width: 360px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/01/featherweightgoset04.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-4494" alt="featherweightgoset04" src="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/01/featherweightgoset04.jpg?resize=360%2C270" width="360" height="270" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">The board unfolded</figcaption></figure>
The board is made of fabric and has a nice feel to it. It does have a little issue staying flat after being packaged and folded for so long, but a little patience and flattening helped to keep it pretty straight. And like the description says, it really does feel like a full size board when you spread it out over the table.<br />
<figure id="attachment_4495" style="width: 360px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/01/featherweightgoset05.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-4495" alt="featherweightgoset05" src="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/01/featherweightgoset05.jpg?resize=360%2C270" width="360" height="270" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Close-up of the stones</figcaption></figure>
As you can see for the stones, they are not simply plastic biconvex stones; but they also have a flat center on both sides in order to ease with the stone placement on the board. Though this is contrary to typical stone design, I think that this works out great for this set since the plastic stones are not very heavy to begin with. So as a result, the flat center really helps out.<br />
<figure id="attachment_4496" style="width: 360px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/01/featherweightgoset06.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-4496" alt="featherweightgoset06" src="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/01/featherweightgoset06.jpg?resize=360%2C270" width="360" height="270" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Entire set in action</figcaption></figure>
<figure id="attachment_4497" style="width: 360px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/01/featherweightgoset07.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-4497" alt="featherweightgoset07" src="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/01/featherweightgoset07.jpg?resize=360%2C270" width="360" height="270" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Close-up of the set in action</figcaption></figure>
As you can see, it&#8217;s a great set that really provides a wonderful experience when it&#8217;s impossible to carry around a wooden board and real stones. As someone who has used cheaper &#8220;featherweight&#8221; sets that were plastic boards and such, this is a huge improvement and is the one I recommend if you&#8217;re looking for your &#8220;featherweight go set.&#8221; Hope this helped!<br />
