<h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>
<p>Introducing go to new people is a topic that I’m very passionate about and it’s something that I think a lot of people mess up. To be fair, it’s not their fault and they are not intentionally doing so. It’s just that people don’t realize how the lack or presence of certain teaching principles can have profoundly different results.<br />
I come from the belief that one day go will be known by the masses and played by all kinds of people. I don’t believe that it is a game for “smart” people and have no intention of seeing it get shelved as a niche of a game that only “intellectuals” play. Everything you’re about to read comes from personal experience and/or things that I have actually witnessed in real life, so there’s nothing theoretical about it. In addition, I have to emphasize that this “manifesto” focuses on people brand new to go. More established players are not considered below.<br />
With that said, let’s dive right into it shall we?<br />
<span id="more-5541"></span></p>
<h3 id="principle1:youarenotteachinggo.">Principle #1: You are not teaching go.</h3>
<p>Wait what? Isn’t this whole article about how to “teach” go? In one sense it is, but you’ll also notice that I put the team “teach” in quotes because I think it puts people in a completely incorrect mindset.<br />
When a person tries to teach something, I have found that they are always very quick to correct a person’s mistake. Once they get it in their heads that they are “teaching,” there is this sense of superiority and a desire to raise the “perfect student.”<br />
What do I mean by “perfect student?” Well what’s the ideal situation for introducing a new person to go? Easy. They become hooked and become obsessed with the game the way many of us are. However, the reality of it is that people of this mentality are far and few between.<br />
What most people often forget is that go is simply a game to most people. Like chess, checkers, or video games, it is just one way to pass the time and enjoy themselves. It is not something that they obsess over and try to improve at the way most of us do. As a result, the mindset needs to be completely different for these people.<br />
Teaching go is reserved for trying to help a player gain another stone in rank. This is not what you are doing. You are simply trying to help someone learn the rules of go and be able to play a game on their own. It doesn’t matter if their moves are great, or whether or not they make mistakes, they simply need to be able to play and you will have accomplished your goal.<br />
To put it another way, imagine that board games are like restaurants in a food court and the prospective customers’ appetites are their free time and energy. When a person comes into the food court looking to figure out where to eat, do you think that they are going to eat a three course meal at all the restaurants to figure out where they want to eat? Absolutely not! They wouldn’t have the stomach for it!<br />
So what’s the solution? The sample of course. You offer samples to all prospective customers because having them simply take the time to actually try your product is what you really need. If they like it, they’ll come in and enjoy all your restaurant has to offer. Or maybe they can’t sit down today, but because the sample you offered was great, they’ll come back another time. And worst case scenario, they don’t care much for it; but even in this scenario, at least they know what your food is and can tell people what it is.<br />
As a result, your goal is not to “teach” go; but to instead market and sell it to anyone willing to give you their time and attention. You are not a teacher. You are a go enthusiast who wants to share with everyone why go is awesome and why they should play it. And the way you are going to do that is not by teaching them the game, but by introducing the rules to them in a fun and easy way.</p>
<h3 id="principle2:keepitsimplestupidk.i.s.s..">Principle #2: Keep it simple stupid (K.I.S.S.).</h3>
<p>Whenever anyone is learning anything new, the most important thing is that they get to practice, practice, and practice. So what does that mean for us as we show them the ropes of how to play go? Stop trying to introduce new and advanced concepts when they’ve barely grasped how go works.<br />
Case and point. Let’s say you’ve just finished teaching someone how to capture stones. You ask them if they understand and they nod. At this point, you might feel compelled to the launch into this lengthy explanation about life and death or ko works; but don’t do it! That is one of the absolute worst things you could possibly do.<br />
You have to realize that thinking you understand something is WAY different than applying it. I cannot even count the number of times where the player told me that they “understood” what I had just explained but had a difficult time actually applying it in the game. For example, once we start playing first capture, the board will get slightly complicated, and if I ask them to identify which group they are able to capture with one move, they get confused and can’t find the group! This is by no means their fault, but it illustrates the point I’m trying to make in that it’s easy to think they grasped a concept when in fact they really haven’t.<br />
So I have a basic rule to follow, avoid the following topics when explaining the game or playing with a new player:</p>
<ol>
<li>Suicide</li>
<li>Ko</li>
<li>Life and Death</li>
<li>Tesujis</li>
<li>Komi</li>
<li>Shape Efficiency (like why empty triangles are bad)</li>
</ol>
<p>This sounds crazy to full-fledged go players, but I have seen countless beginners who play full games on a 9&#215;9 board without ever questioning those things. They delight and find joy in simply being able to play and apply what they just learned. After all, isn’t it much easier to play a game when there aren’t a bunch of exceptions to remember? Go has one of the simplest rulesets needed to start playing, so why complicate that?<br />
And to top it off, exceptions (like suicide and ko) are much easier to remember when they are discovered by the players themselves. There have been plenty of times when I was playing with a new player when they would stop me and go, “Wait a second. What about this?” In that case, by all means teach it to them! After all, if they are thinking at that level, it means they have grasped the other material which is great! Otherwise, let them practice with the simple ruleset as much as they want. After all, you want them to remember how to play the game the next day right?</p>
<h3 id="principle3.givethemasmanyopportunitiesforsuccessaspossible.">Principle #3. Give them as many opportunities for success as possible.</h3>
<p>When I had a chance to take a break from teaching last Saturday, I saw a classic scenario occurring on a number of the boards throughout the table: the new player was getting demolished and the person “teaching” had a bunch of stones as prisoners. I could only shake my head as my mind screamed, “Are you trying to discourage him from playing go?!?!”<br />
I understand that there are some players who relish in getting crushed and see it as a challenge, but I <strong><em>guarantee</em></strong> you that most people you will be introducing the game to will <strong><em>not</em></strong> be like this at all. In fact, even something as simple as not grasping the rules is often reason enough for most people to walk away from learning a game. So imagine what it would be like if you are struggling to grasp the rules and getting destroyed at the same time. I don’t know about you, but I probably wouldn’t be playing this game any time soon. And that is precisely what we <strong>don’t</strong> want.<br />
If you take a moment and think about successful games or apps, they tend to share one common functionality: they have really intuitive tutorials that make it very easy to go through because each level of accomplishment is often as simple as a touch or a swipe on your screen. In other words, they make it fun for someone to pick up the basics so that they can easily transition into the more advanced features later on.<br />
In the same spirit, I strongly believe that go should be taught in the same manner. People respond well when they feel like they are accomplishing something or doing well at something. As a result, it is critical that they are given as many opportunities as possible to feel that way. By doing so, you will improve the chances that they will actually remember how to play the game the next day and maybe even share it with others one day.</p>
<h3 id="mybasiccurriculumforbrandnewplayers">My Basic Curriculum for Brand New Players</h3>
<p>Of course, some of you are wondering how I introduce new players to the game. While I’m still working out the kinks and plan to eventually release a detailed curriculum, here’s the general outline:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Start with the absolute basics of the game.</strong> Use other games that most people are familiar with to start differentiating the most basic rules of go. For example, in chess and checkers, you place pieces in the square. In go, we put the pieces on the intersections.</li>
<li><strong>Explain the concept of liberties and give them plenty of opportunity of practice for counting the liberties of stones.</strong> This is a really easy way to give them opportunities for accomplishing things and feeling like they are making progress.</li>
<li><strong>If time permits, I give them practice scenarios for capturing stones to further reinforce the idea of liberties and capturing.</strong> So you would make a shape with your stones and surround it except for it’s last liberty, and then have the person play the correct move to capture the group.</li>
<li><strong>We play a couple games of first capture on a 9&#215;9 board.</strong> (1) I refrain from using any tesujis and constantly leave weaknesses open for the new player to spot. (2) I constantly let them undo and encourage it in fact. (3) My goal is not to win, but to give them continuous opportunities to practice and reinforce what we just learned.</li>
<li><strong>If they are still interested in taking the next step in learning about go, then that’s when I explain the concept of territory and its importance in determining how one wins or loses in go.</strong> People often have trouble understanding this part, but I make the analogy of war and two parties coming to sign a peace treaty and they usually understand.</li>
<li><strong>Finally, I give them either 6–9 stones handicap (on a 9&#215;9 board) depending on how fast they grasped the other concepts and play with them.</strong> Yes, the handicap is ridiculous, but it doesn’t matter because I’m not trying to win. I simply want them to play. If they are playing and spending more time on the game, I’m accomplished my goal.</li>
</ol>
<p>And just to reiterate from Principle #2, I avoid all the exceptions to the rules (like ko, suicide, etc.) and nuances unless the player asks me about it or it naturally occurs in a game. But for the most part, I avoid letting situations like ko arise for the sheer fact that I want the player spending as much time soaking up and reinforcing the basic rules of go as long as I possibly can.</p>
<h3 id="otheradvicefrommyexperience">Other Advice from My Experience</h3>
<ol>
<li><strong>Don’t kill any big groups</strong>. If you’re playing a 9&#215;9 board game and you notice that a group only has one eye, don’t try to kill it. In fact, you should actually try to play in a way that makes him live without him realizing it.</li>
<li><strong>If the score is going to end up in the negative points, you better be the one with the negative score.</strong> As an experienced go player, you should not take any pleasure in crushing a new player and leaving them with negative points. In fact, you should feel ashamed if you let the game become that way. If anyone should have negative points, let it be you.</li>
<li><strong>Even if a group only has one eye at the end of the game (9&#215;9), I just let it live and count the points.</strong> This is probably hard for a lot of players to do, but I honestly see no value in pointing out that their group is dead. New players won’t know that you let it slide and it prevents them from feeling like they suffered a humiliating defeat. And to be honest, once you’re done showing how the game ends and score is counted, you are usually moving on to the next game. So what’s the point?</li>
</ol>
<p>So to end this long rant, at the end of the day, you have to remember this key fact: people have no obligation to learn, play, or even remember what the game of go is. It doesn’t matter if they never get ranked or never play on a 19&#215;19 board. If you can get them to remember what the game is and vaguely how to play it, you’ve already done an immense service to the go community. And maybe, just maybe, one day we will live in a world where people will stop coming up to me and ask if I’m playing othello.</p>

<figure id="attachment_5444" style="width: 488px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/06/wgw44.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-5444" src="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/06/wgw44.jpg?resize=488%2C299" alt="Credit to TheChangeBlog" width="488" height="299" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Credit to <a title="Source for featured image" href="http://www.thechangeblog.com/success-in-life/">TheChangeBlog</a></figcaption></figure>
Up until a month or so ago, my go had become quite rigid. In fact, it could be compared to an ice sculpture where the curves and angles have all been predefined. And though it is admirable in one aspect, it also represents a sense of rigidity and does not have much room for growth. And since my goal was to build something way better, it was only natural that it was time to set it on fire and let it melt away. And now that I am left with this pool of water, while the prospect of building a grand ice sculpture sounds great, it&#8217;s been rather difficult figuring out where to begin.<br />
For those who don&#8217;t use <a title="BenGoZen's Twitter" href="http://www.twitter.com/bengozen">Twitter</a>, I recently tweeted about picking up <a title="Book Review: Lessons in the Fundamentals of Go" href="//book-review-lessons-in-the-fundamentals-of-go/"><em>Lessons in the Fundamentals of Go</em></a> by Kageyama 7P again. You might wonder why I&#8217;m doing this. After all, I&#8217;ve read this book at least four or five times at this point. However, I&#8217;ve noticed that my progress in go has reached a vulnerable stage. It&#8217;s not stagnant, yet it is not necessarily progressing either in the traditional sense of climbing ranks. Instead of complaining and being frustrated however, I&#8217;ve decided that this is as good a time as any to return to the fundamentals.<br />
<span id="more-5442"></span><br />
I am currently at a place where my go feels directionless, so I have been trying to establish some new foundations through standard training exercises: life and death problems, studying the <a title="Book Review: Jump Level Up 1" href="//book-review-jump-level-1/">Jump Level Up</a> series, replaying Go Seigen&#8217;s games, and playing games as well. While all those activities will surely benefit me somehow in the future, my go felt as shapeless as ever. And since I don&#8217;t have a true teacher and mentor (in terms of taking private lessons), I was rather lost in terms of what to do next.<br />
As I was perusing my bookshelf and picking up book after book (i.e., The Basics of Go Strategy, Positional Judgment, etc.), the bright yellow binding caught my eye and I breathed a sigh of relief as it hit me. <strong>Just go back to the fundamentals.</strong><br />
It&#8217;s true that having a teacher would make my life a lot easier. After all, he/she would know me so well that devising a customized training program would be a piece of cake. However, for the numerous players out there who either haven&#8217;t found a teacher or it is too expensive, I wrote this post to remind you that there is still hope out there for people like us.<br />
While gaining a stone becomes harder as you climb the ladder, remember that it only becomes truly difficult as you climb into the higher ranks of dan. Until then, remember that a lot of our weaknesses can be found in our lack of the fundamentals. And if there is anyone who can give you a swift kick in the butt to remind you of that, it is Kageyama.<br />
So if you&#8217;re serious about getting stronger at go, make sure you have a copy of <em><a title="Book Review: Lessons in the Fundamentals of Go" href="//book-review-lessons-in-the-fundamentals-of-go/">Lessons in the Fundamentals of Go</a> </em>in your collection of go books. It will be your beacon of light as you try and make your way into the dan levels and above.</p>

For Game 5 of this epic <a title="Gu Li and Lee Sedol Jubango" href="//gu-li-lee-sedol-jubango/">jubango</a> between Lee Sedol (9P) and Gu Li (9P), we are at an exciting point in this match as the record stands at 2-2! So for this fifth game, this will serve as the tiebreaker for who takes the lead into the second half of the jubango!<br />
In case you don&#8217;t follow the professional scene, up to this point, Gu Li (9p) has been doing very well against Lee Sedol (9p) and was considered the favorite to win this match since he also won the last two jubango matches as well.<br />
With that said, buckle in for one of the most exciting games they&#8217;ve played to date! Hope you enjoy the review!<br />

For most of the time I studied go, I was always focused on getting the right answer. Perhaps this is a result of being conditioned from school and being obsessed with answering the question correctly, but nonetheless it showed up in my approach to studying go. So more often than not, if I managed to guess what the correct answer was for a particular problem, that would be the end of it and I would move on to the next problem. After all, I got the right answer and that&#8217;s what&#8217;s important isn&#8217;t it?<br />
Of course, the next question is what happened if I got the answer wrong. Well, since I got the answer wrong, the logical choice would be to see what the correct answer is and try to memorize it. In other words, I would focus on understanding why the correct answer was correct and was less concerned with why my answer was wrong. Standard studying mechanism for taking any test in a class right?<br />
Unfortunately, while that sounds okay in theory and may have helped me get through school rather easily, it turns out I have been barking up the wrong tree this entire time.<br />

Recently, fellow go player saxmaam gave her recommendation for <a title="Talent Code Audible Link" href="http://www.audible.com/pd/Science-Technology/The-Talent-Code-Audiobook/B002V8L6MA">The Talent Code</a> by Daniel Coyle, which is themed on the idea of &#8220;unlocking the secret to learning just about any skill.&#8221; I had heard of the book before and been told to read it in the past, but I was too caught up in other things at the time and never got around to it. However, as my approach and perspective on go has been undergoing a lot of transformation recently, so I decided to take it as a sign from the universe that it was time to finally read it.<br />
I haven&#8217;t finished it yet, but I was presented with an idea that inspired the post for today: <strong>one of the key components to learning a skill is making mistakes along the way</strong>. In other words, the essence of getting stronger resides in the struggle it takes to the correct answer and not simply finding the correct answer. And though it seems like such an obvious statement, it is one that I ignored for most of my journey as a go player.<br />
One of the things Coyle talks about is that people who master skills often spend a lot of time focused on what he calls &#8220;deliberate learning.&#8221; In other words, there is a significant conscious effort to constantly critically analyze and patch up weaknesses as the person encounters them. A good analogy for this would be like learning how to play a song on an instrument. Instead of simply trying to play through the whole thing and just barely getting by the tough parts of the song, a person will spend the time to really struggle with that section until they get it right before resuming with the rest of the song.<br />
I grew up playing piano for most of my life and spent many years and hours in the field of music. And when I think back to it, I am rather ashamed of the fact that I was not always the most disciplined when it came to this kind of &#8220;deliberate learning.&#8221; In fact, my thought was always if I could get through most of song without a problem, it would be good enough. After all, who could tell the difference as long as I wasn&#8217;t perfect for the entire song. 80-90% should be good enough right?<br />
When it came to go, the habit of &#8220;winging&#8221; it and getting by with only a general understanding of what was going on became the foundation of how I studied the game. And as a result, the time and energy I spent studying the game was more leisurely and less &#8220;deliberate learning.&#8221;<br />
Upon reflection of my past, I realize now that I was wrong to avoid that stage of struggling during learning. For most of my life, I always felt that if I was struggling, then it was some sign of failure and/or ineptitude. And though you&#8217;ll think I was crazy, I really did think that things coming easy to a person was a sign of talent and the mark of potential success. Perhaps it&#8217;s because I was always surrounded by people more brilliant than I, but those ideas were a part of me for a long time.<br />
I wanted to write this post because I don&#8217;t believe I&#8217;m the only one out there making this mistake. And though I haven&#8217;t figured out the magical equation for how one can ensure they are using &#8220;deliberate learning&#8221; in their study of go (which I will definitely write about when I starting figuring it out), hopefully this post will serve as an inspiration for some of you and a reminder to not get frustrated by those times you struggle with certain ideas and concepts. After all, it is the key to gaining that next stone.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 style="text-align: center;">Weekly Go Wednesday, Issue #41</h2>
<figure id="attachment_5339" style="width: 494px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Keybladesandwarriors.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-5339" src="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Keybladesandwarriors.jpg?resize=494%2C371" alt="Credit to Kingdom Hearts 3 Trailer" width="494" height="371" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Screenshot from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q5j8lQ9_9Cc">Kingdom Hearts 2 Secret Ending</a></figcaption></figure>
As many of you are aware, I have been known to prioritize studying and have had no qualms sacrificing playing games in order to do so. My rationale at the time was quite simple: Because I felt like I was always on a time crunch, reading books, studying problems, or even watching videos seemed to be better suited to my lifestyle. 15 minutes here&#8230; 5 minutes there&#8230; That way I could keep &#8220;improving&#8221; without the huge time commitment. Right?<br />
Well, maybe only half right. While I might have picked up a thing or two along the way, my experience at the <a title="1st Washington Open Baduk Championship — Part I" href="//1st-washington-open-baduk-championship-part/">1st Washington Baduk Open Championship</a> was rather traumatic. After getting my butt kicked twice in a row after the first round and deep introspection, I realized I needed to play more. So in light of that realization, I thought it only appropriate to write about the importance of experience on the battlefield.<br />
<span id="more-10"></span><br />
The reason I spent so long focusing on studying instead of playing was for the following reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>&#8220;I will only play long games.&#8221;</strong> &#8211; I forget when I came to this conclusion, but I thought that any game less than 30 minutes main time would be &#8220;too short&#8221; for me. Therefore&#8230;</li>
<li><strong>&#8220;Don&#8217;t have enough time.&#8221;</strong> &#8211; Since 30 min main time games took about 1.5 hours to 2 hours, I felt that I never had that block of time to play.</li>
<li><strong>&#8220;I can study anywhere.&#8221;</strong> &#8211; I&#8217;ve never been a huge fan of playing on my mobile phone, so playing games wasn&#8217;t as convenient as studying books / problems.</li>
</ol>
<p>I mean, sure, I played a few games here and there; but I didn&#8217;t play consistently and definitely did not play as seriously as I might have if I played ranked games. So to no one&#8217;s surprise, my stamina at the tournament was just awful.<br />
After talking with Myung and learning that most Korean players actually play with 10 minute main time, it made me realize that my mandate of only playing &#8220;long games&#8221; was ridiculous and would only stunt my growth. And since I&#8217;ve made the change to play with shorter time settings, it&#8217;s made a huge difference for me.<br />
Whether you like it or not, your skills are only as good as they are on the battlefield. It&#8217;s irrelevant if you can solve dan level problems on your cell phone if you keep making basic mistakes in your actual games.<br />
No amount of book reading or problem solving can replace the invaluable experience of playing actual games, so get out there and play! Brace yourself for the biting wind of intense and competitive play as you charge into the fray to temper your blade. Charge!!!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 style="text-align: center;">Weekly Go Wednesday, Issue #40</h2>
<p>Recently I have found myself exploring a lot of new ideas and concepts from varying schools of go. A simple example of this is my inability to stick with reviewing one style of go at a time. For example, last week I was very motivated to finally purchase <a href="http://www.slateandshell.com/SSYZ009.html#sthash.z3luFkAt.dpuf">Master Play: The Territorial Styles of Kitani &amp; Cho Chikun</a> and find out what it really meant to have a &#8220;territorial style.&#8221; It was a fascinating and eye opening read; but once I had read most of the book within a few hours, I was suddenly driven to go back and study <a title="Book Review: The Fighting Styles of Kato Masao and Seo Bong Soo" href="//book-review-fighting-styles-kato-masao-seo-bong-soo/">Master Play: The Fighting Styles of Kato Masao &amp; Seo Bong Soo</a> as well! Talk about opposing styles!<br />
As you might expect, my games have also started to undergo a change as well. I find myself trying all sorts of weird and new things lately because of all these new ideas floating around my head. So as I was perusing for ideas to write for this week&#8217;s Weekly Go Wednesday, the following quotation from Pablo Picasso inspired me to write this post:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;I am always doing that which I cannot do in order that I may learn how to do it.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p><span id="more-4520"></span><br />
With my interests being all over the place, it really does feel as if I am undergoing some sort of transformation in my go. Stones seem to move and speak to me differently as I play games now. Maybe it&#8217;s just the mere fact that I am playing more. Hard to say, but what I will say is true is that Picasso&#8217;s quotation is at the heart of my games lately.<br />
Whenever an opportunity arises to try something new, I rarely hesitate to try it in my games anymore. There is far less concern for winning and/or fear of losing than I used to have in the past. So games have felt more like laboratory experiments as of late. Sometimes I&#8217;ve thought to play super tight territorial moves to try and mimic Kitani, and then other times I&#8217;ll intentionally abandon a group the way Seo Bong Soo would do so in order to draw the game into a complicated battle between multiple groups.*<br />
<em>*This is not to be confused with turning the game into one giant capturing race or killing one huge dragon. Instead it is more along the lines of the back and forth of fighting between multiple groups that results in territory being gained or trades being made in exchange for different parts of the board. In other words, true fighting and not one gigantic field of bloodshed. </em><br />
By doing this, I have felt like I have started taking steps forward in deepening my understanding of my own go. Instead of simply sticking to what I know, exploring new territory and ideas in my own games has been incredibly rewarding in not only my growth as a player, but my appreciation for the game as well.<br />
The best example of this is my recent study of the &#8220;territorial style.&#8221; While I have always known of this style, I would have to say that I had little to no appreciation for it up until recently. It&#8217;s not  that I looked down on the style or had any disrespect for it, but I always scoffed at the idea of ever playing that way since I was always interested in &#8220;fighting&#8221; or &#8220;attacking&#8221; (both of which are concepts I actually never really understood either).<br />
Yet, with my curiosity of late, letting myself learn about the territorial style of go has really done wonders to the way I approach the game. I have even tried using it myself in some of my games with some success and even enjoyed it! And I never would have thought of it this way, but gaining insight into the &#8220;territorial style&#8221; is really opening me up to start really figuring out where my style of go is. And though I thought I had it all figured out, I realized my style is still a molten hot ingot of steel waiting to be forged to the perfect sword. (But this is another topic in itself, so let&#8217;s save that for another time.)<br />
At the end of the day, I think what I&#8217;m trying to say is don&#8217;t let yourself be confined to any one perspective. More often than we&#8217;d like to admit, the only way for us to further our progress is to do things that we are uncomfortable with. And by doing so, we not only gain valuable insight into ideas and concept that transform our minds, but also an irreplaceable experience that will only add to the complex tapestry that is our life.</p>

For Game 4 of this epic <a title="Gu Li and Lee Sedol Jubango" href="//gu-li-lee-sedol-jubango/">jubango</a> between Lee Sedol (9P) and Gu Li (9P), with the current record being 2-1 in Lee Sedol&#8217;s favor, everyone sat in anticipation as they waited to see if Gu Li would be able to even up the record! With Gu Li&#8217;s record against Lee Sedol as of late though, many fans were certainly feeling that Gu Li had a great chance to win this game.<br />

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center;"><a title="1st Washington Open Baduk Championship — Part I" href="//1st-washington-open-baduk-championship-part/">Part I</a> &#8211; <strong>Interlude</strong> &#8211; <a title="1st Washington Open Baduk Championship — Part II" href="//1st-washington-open-baduk-championship-part-ii/">Part II</a></p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Weekly Go Wednesday, Issue #38</h2>
<p>Though some of you may hate me for delaying Part II of my <a title="1st Washington Open Baduk Championship — Part I" href="//1st-washington-open-baduk-championship-part/">1st Washington Open Baduk Championship</a> series, the funny thing is that the Weekly Go Wednesday series actually fits in perfectly with the story. So hold your horses for one more day, and let&#8217;s dive right into this shall we?<br />
So where were we? Ah yes. I had finished off the <a title="1st Washington Open Baduk Championship — Part I" href="//1st-washington-open-baduk-championship-part/">first day of the tournament</a> with the second to worst record you can have: 1 win with 2 loss. To compound on that embarrassment, I won one and then proceeded to lose each game afterwards with each being a more epic failure than the last. After all, it would have been way better if I had lost the first two games and then won the last one. Then at least I could feel like I improved over the day instead of the epic plummet that actually happened.<br />
Usually when I undergo a shocking disappointment like I did that day, my first reaction is to try and figure out what went wrong. After all, it wasn&#8217;t as if some freak accident happened where I hallucinated and put the stones in the wrong place. No, especially with go, there are no such things. So for the rest of the day, I kept thinking about what went wrong. Many things crossed my mind&#8230;<br />
<span id="more-5141"></span><br />
The first (and most self-pitying) of my thoughts was the simple fact that I wasn&#8217;t actually 3 kyu. KGS and the AGA might have ranked me as 3 kyu, but maybe the statistics were biased and overly generous since I did not play often enough to get an accurate measurement of my strength. So perhaps I was really more like 4-5 kyu when it came to the competitive scene. But after trying to entertain that thought a bit longer, even I realized how absurd that notion was.<br />
Since that wasn&#8217;t it, the next thing that I came up with was the fact that I lacked the stamina to survive tournaments. In other words, I might be able to play one serious game a day and then a few casual ones; but in a tournament setting with all the pressure and intensity, I ran out of steam and could barely win one game. After all, I had stopped playing ranked games (aka serious games with strangers) and was probably more out of practice than I was willing to admit at the time.<br />
Okay. That made sense, but I concluded that it could not be the only reason. After all, being tired doesn&#8217;t explain the self-destruction that occurred as the day went on. After all, it&#8217;s not as if I just made a few bad reading mistakes, it&#8217;s like my brain decided to take a vacation and I was playing like a mad man. So there must be more&#8230;<br />
Ah. Could a part of it be arrogance from the fact that the last full tournament I played in (<a title="NOVA Pumpkin Classic Tournament 2012 — Introduction" href="//nova-pumpkin-class-2012-intro/">NOVA Pumpkin Classic</a>) resulted in me have a perfect record and getting 1st place? And in hindsight, I had not really prepared for that tournament, so perhaps I subconsciously thought that this tournament might be similar. Maybe I could just wing it and do well like last time. Not necessarily win, but at least do well. You know?<br />
<span style="line-height: 1.5em;">Well, that was about how far I got with my introspection when I arrived in a nearby conference room to see Park Sohyun (3p) playing a teaching game with one of the VIPs.*</span><br />
<em>*To give some background on this story though, the VIP she was playing a teaching game with was actually an insei when he was younger. So while he was older now and out of practice, there was no doubt in my mind that he was pretty strong (i.e., he only took 2 stones for the game).</em><br />
<figure id="attachment_5164" style="width: 420px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014-WOpen-10.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-5164" alt="2014-WOpen-10" src="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014-WOpen-10.jpg?resize=420%2C560" width="420" height="560" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">I didn&#8217;t want to take a picture of her from the front at this time because I didn&#8217;t get a chance to ask if it would be okay and she was in a middle of the game.</figcaption></figure>
They would play for like 30-40 moves, and then he would have a question for her and they would rewind the game back like 20 moves or clear off an area of the board to talk about a particular sequence or concept. And then the game would resume another 30-40 moves before the same thing happened again.<br />
I could not understand anything they were talking about since they spoke in Korean. However,as I watched the game unfold, I would watch as her moves exuded with power as they came down on the board. And at the same time, I watched as the VIP tried his best to hold his ground against her while ending up with this very over concentrated groups that she would harass while continuing to gain a greater advantage on the board with each move.<br />
The weird thing is that it&#8217;s not as if I had never met a professional or seen a professional play against an amateur before. Yet for some reason, her moves captivated me in a way I had never quite felt before. As I watched in awe, each and every move came flowing down with a grace and beauty that I can only describe as surreal.<br />

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 style="text-align: center;">Weekly Go Wednesday, Issue #37</h2>
<p>Last <a title="Friday Go Forward: Week 58" href="//friday-go-forward-week-58/">Friday</a>, I mentioned an <a title="Lynx's How to Improve at Go" href="http://shobia.com/w/How_to_Improve_at_Go">article</a> that was shared with me on how to improve at go by Lynx. According to conventional wisdom, the one piece of advice that everyone seem to agree upon is that studying life and death is critical to getting stronger. And to be honest, it&#8217;s something I never really questioned. However, after reading Lynx&#8217;s article, I was confronted with an eye-opening question: <strong>Is studying tesuji more useful than tsumego? </strong><br />
After a lot of thought,  I would have to concur  with Lynx&#8217;s perspective. In fact, it is one of the key components to breaking the glass ceiling when trying to gain that next stone. However, because the masses constantly spout how important life and death is, it is often forgotten in all the noise.<br />
<span style="line-height: 1.5em;">Now now, before you grab your pitchforks and torches, hear me out won&#8217;t you?</span><br />
<span id="more-5039"></span><br />
To start, I will go ahead and address probably the strongest argument against Lynx&#8217;s theory: What is the use of tesuji if you die everywhere?<br />
True. If your life and skills are so abysmal that you are slaughtered around the board, I agree with you in that tesuji will not do you much good. However, the reality of the situation is that most games don&#8217;t consist of groups dying all over the board (unless the rank is horribly imbalanced). And though this can partially be attributed to people studying life and death, my personal experience has shown me that the bottom line is that <em>it is really hard to kill groups in go</em>.<br />
Though people might not realize it, I think that players will inevitably learn about life and death as they play. Why do I say this? Because whenever your group dies, it is usually pretty traumatic. Who can remember that time when they thought their corner was alive and then died in a magnificent burst of flames? I know I can recount it on multiple occasions. And what happens when you die? Well usually you might go back to figure out how you could&#8217;ve avoided it. After all, who likes dying?<br />
On top of that, let&#8217;s not forget the fact that players constantly miss tesuji in their games. It is usually very obvious to players who are much stronger, but unless someone is having their game reviewed by such a player, how many people are going to spend time going over their game to figure out the numerous tesuji they missed? Highly unlikely. They are way more likely to just move on and play another game.<br />
In addition, no matter how peaceful a player you are, you are eventually going to get into fights on the board. I&#8217;m sure there are kifu that exists where no one challenged each other at all, but I&#8217;m pretty sure they only exist at the beginner level since they aren&#8217;t aware they are capable of invading and living. And when it comes to fighting, there is no better weapon than being better at tesuji than your opponent.<br />
Who remembers this scene?<br />

Anyhow, was this a move that dealt with life and death? Did Sai&#8217;s incredible move kill the Meijin&#8217;s group? No. It was a brilliant tesuji that made all spectators watch in amazement. And in fact, if you think about it, most of the moves that are met with astonishment and awe in the show are usually tesuji. They are all about how brilliant that connection was, or how this peep is an excellent forcing move that allows XYZ tesuji to work.<br />
Finally, I want to remind you that Lynx&#8217;s point is <strong><em>not</em></strong> to burn all your tsumego books and never life and death. Instead, she&#8217;s simply trying to remind us of how important tesuji are when it comes to gaining that next stone. So the next time you are thinking about what to study, I hope that you&#8217;ll consider making some time to study tesuji in your busy schedule. It&#8217;ll definitely be worth your while in the long run.</p>

For Game 3 of the epic <a title="Gu Li and Lee Sedol Jubango" href="//gu-li-lee-sedol-jubango/">jubango</a> between Lee Sedol (9P) and Gu Li (9P), we have arrived at a crucial point. Lee Sedol is already 2-0 (<a title="WGW 31: Gu Li vs Lee Sedol — Jubango Game 1 Amateur Review" href="//wgw-31-gu-li-vs-lee-sedol-jubango-game-1-amateur-review/">Game 1</a> and <a title="WGW 33: Gu Li vs Lee Sedol — Jubango Game 2 Amateur Review" href="//wgw-33-gu-li-vs-lee-sedol-jubango-game-2-amateur-review/">Game 2</a>) and there is concern that the jubango will end earlier than desired. After all, everyone wants to see all 10 games. However, the rules of the jubango is that the first to six victories win. As a result, for this game, even Lee Sedol fans were rooting for Gu Li to turn the tide so that we could see more games.<br />
For those who don&#8217;t keep up with the professional scene, Gu Li had managed to beat Lee Sedol in two other tournament matches prior to this game, so even though there was concern that there would be too much pressure on Gu Li, people had high hopes that Gu Li would be able to make a comeback this game.<br />
As with the previous reviews (<a title="WGW 31: Gu Li vs Lee Sedol — Jubango Game 1 Amateur Review" href="//wgw-31-gu-li-vs-lee-sedol-jubango-game-1-amateur-review/">Game 1</a> and <a title="WGW 33: Gu Li vs Lee Sedol — Jubango Game 2 Amateur Review" href="//wgw-33-gu-li-vs-lee-sedol-jubango-game-2-amateur-review/">Game 2</a>), this review continues to be geared towards kyu players who struggle with the advanced analysis and discussion that normally occurs between dan and professional level players. There is commentary for every move so that hopefully you won&#8217;t ever feel lost. In addition, I am happy to announce that frozensoul (5d) has joined forces with me again for this game review. Many thanks goes out to him for providing a number of the insights you&#8217;ll see throughout the review.<br />
Just like before, please let me know if you notice anything or have any suggestions that I can do to improve the review. I look forward to getting your feedback on this game review. Hope you enjoy it and learn a thing or two through it!<br />
