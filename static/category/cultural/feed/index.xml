Last week, I had the pleasure of attending the 54th <a title="Sakura Matsuri Official Site" href="http://www.sakuramatsuri.org/">Sakura Matsuri Street Festival</a> in Washington D.C.! For those who don&#8217;t know, this is in conjunction with the annual <a title="Cherry Blossom Festival Official Site" href="http://www.nationalcherryblossomfestival.org/">Cherry Blossom Festival</a> that is held in D.C. every year and runs from 10:30AM to 6:30PM. And for a nominal fee of $10, you get entry into a street full of vendors, performances, cultural booths, and most importantly, the go booth!<br />
<span id="more-5096"></span><br />
<figure id="attachment_5098" style="width: 346px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014SakuraMatsuri-02.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-5098" alt="2014SakuraMatsuri-02" src="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014SakuraMatsuri-02.jpg?resize=346%2C461" width="346" height="461" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Though a bit blurry, you can get a sense of how crowded it was. Not for the claustrophobic!</figcaption></figure>
Making your way through the crowd was a bit of a challenge since people would randomly stop to look at things or be waiting in these long lines for food. So as you can expect, there were all sorts of random jams in the street. However, once you make your way past the main intersection, it didn&#8217;t take long before you found yourself before the go booth.<br />
<figure id="attachment_5099" style="width: 448px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014SakuraMatsuri-03.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-5099" alt="2014SakuraMatsuri-03" src="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014SakuraMatsuri-03.jpg?resize=448%2C448" width="448" height="448" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Here&#8217;s a shot of our booth from the main side.</figcaption></figure>
<figure id="attachment_5100" style="width: 448px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014SakuraMatsuri-04.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-5100" alt="2014SakuraMatsuri-04" src="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014SakuraMatsuri-04.jpg?resize=448%2C448" width="448" height="448" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Here&#8217;s a shot of the booth from the left side peering into the booth.</figcaption></figure>
I arrived a couple hours late, but as you can see in the shots above, things were quite busy! Even though we had around 8-10 teachers, you can see that everyone is busy teaching. Definitely something I was ecstatic to see as a go enthusiast.<br />
<figure id="attachment_5101" style="width: 448px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014SakuraMatsuri-05.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-5101" alt="2014SakuraMatsuri-05" src="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014SakuraMatsuri-05.jpg?resize=448%2C448" width="448" height="448" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Pictured: Myself (center), John (with the hat) and Justin Teng (red jacket)</figcaption></figure>
The shot above is of me after I got settled and teaching my first customer of the day. As you can see on the board, we&#8217;re playing a game of first capture!<br />
<figure id="attachment_5102" style="width: 384px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014SakuraMatsuri-06.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-5102" alt="2014SakuraMatsuri-06" src="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014SakuraMatsuri-06.jpg?resize=384%2C512" width="384" height="512" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">The brochure that we were handing out.</figcaption></figure>
Though we had quite a few brochures printed out (I think more than 200) and had a few pamphlets, I was quite surprised that we had so many people asking for more information that we were running out before 3:00PM had even came around. Definitely a lesson learned for next year!<br />
<figure id="attachment_5103" style="width: 448px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014SakuraMatsuri-07.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-5103" alt="2014SakuraMatsuri-07" src="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014SakuraMatsuri-07-1024x976.jpg?resize=448%2C427" width="448" height="427" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Another shot of us busy at work teaching the never ending crowd of people looking to sit down and have a shot to learn themselves!</figcaption></figure>
After I sat down to start teaching, I have to say that everything was moving at such a fast pace. First, all the students I taught learned at a quick pace and grasped the game pretty quickly. Secondly, there were no shortage of spectators who were paying close attention to what was being taught so they could learn about it themselves. And to my surprise and delight, every time a seat opened up, there was always someone ready to sit down and try their hand at it.<br />
<figure id="attachment_5104" style="width: 384px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014SakuraMatsuri-08.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-5104" alt="2014SakuraMatsuri-08" src="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014SakuraMatsuri-08.jpg?resize=384%2C512" width="384" height="512" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Here&#8217;s a shot of me trying to switch between four different simultaneous teaching games. For  the tech nerds, one of my customers had Google Glasses on! How awesome is that?!</figcaption></figure>
Eventually, things got so busy that I was simultaneously teaching around 2-3 people at a time on average. To streamline the process a bit, I figured out that having everyone to focus on one board while I explained the rules worked out really well. And then when they had an idea what was going on, I would give them their own boards and stones and play simul games with all of them so that they were all equally engaged.<br />
<figure id="attachment_5105" style="width: 384px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014SakuraMatsuri-09.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-5105" alt="2014SakuraMatsuri-09" src="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014SakuraMatsuri-09.jpg?resize=384%2C512" width="384" height="512" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Here&#8217;s a shot of me in my 4 way simul teaching game. But as you notice in the background, the streets are seriously packed and all the teachers are busy teaching.</figcaption></figure>
All in all, the event was a huge success and I felt that a lot of people were able to be exposed to go and learn about it. The only real lesson learned from this event, however, is that we definitely needed a  surplus of marketing material. It would have definitely been nice if we could have handed out more brochures more aggressively without worrying about our inventory.<br />
Finally, the thing that was really great to see what that a majority of the people I taught asked me for more information (for which I promptly gave them my blog and email) and if we even had any go sets to purchase (which we unfortunately did not have and is something I want to look into next year).<br />
So for all those who have any Japanese cultural events in your local area, I definitely encourage you all to try and setup a booth like we did. Because at the end of the day, if there was only one thing I learned from this event, it is that go has a real potential to appeal to all types of people and can eventually become a household staple like chess or checkers if we keep spreading the word with outreach initiatives like this one.<br />
<span style="text-align: center; line-height: 1.5em;">Many thanks to John Goon for coordinating and setting up this event. Definitely looking forward to it next year! </span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center;"><a title="Hong Kong Trip: Part 1 — The Scenery" href="//hong-kong-trip-part-1/">Part 1 — The Scenery</a>   ||   <a title="Hong Kong Trip: Part 2 — The Food" href="//hong-kong-trip-part-2/">Part 2 — The Food</a>   ||   <em>Part 3 — Weiqi</em></p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Introduction</h2>
<p>After much waiting and anticipation, I&#8217;m happy to release the final post on my Hong Kong trip. Since we always save the best for last, it should come as no surprise to you that you had to wait till the very end to hear about my go adventures! Before we go on however, I just wanted to clarify a couple of things. (1) The title of this post was originally &#8220;Go,&#8221; but due to the fact that I was in Hong Kong, I felt it was only appropriate to title it &#8220;Weiqi.&#8221; (2) However, in order to ease the readability of my post, I will be using &#8220;go&#8221; in the text instead of &#8220;weiqi&#8221; for simple consistency with English go literature. With that said, onwards with my go adventure in Hong Kong!</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Part 3 &#8211; Weiqi</h2>
<p>As I&#8217;m sure some of you remember, I posted on <a title="Reddit Hong Kong Post" href="http://www.reddit.com/r/baduk/comments/2059yl/go_players_clubs_in_hong_kong/">reddit</a> and <a title="Preparing for My Hong Kong Trip" href="//preparing-hong-kong-trip/">here</a> before the trip to see if anyone was in the area. Most of the feedback I got from people was that I should visit the <a title="Hong Kong Go Association Website" href="http://www.hkga.org.hk/">Hong Kong Go Association (HKGA)</a>. I was a little saddened by the fact that I was unable to find anyone who lived locally online, but I knew that I couldn&#8217;t bear the idea of going all the way to Asia and not do a single go-related activity. So I promised myself that if I were to do anything for myself this trip, it would be to visit the HKGA.<br />
When we first arrived in Hong Kong, one of the things we did was to go to one of the shopping districts. And believe it or not, as I&#8217;m walking down the street, I see this across the street.<br />
<figure id="attachment_5043" style="width: 640px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014HKP3-01.jpg"><img class="size-large wp-image-5043" alt="2014HKP3-01" src="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014HKP3-01-1024x768.jpg?resize=640%2C480" width="640" height="480" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Wait&#8230; why does that cartoon character look like he&#8217;s doing something I&#8217;m terribly familiar with&#8230;</figcaption></figure>

<figure id="attachment_5044" style="width: 640px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014HKP3-02.jpg"><img class="size-large wp-image-5044" alt="2014HKP3-02" src="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014HKP3-02-1024x768.jpg?resize=640%2C480" width="640" height="480" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Oh&#8230;. my&#8230;.. Sai!!!!!!</figcaption></figure>
Yep. It was an ad for go on a bus. No it wasn&#8217;t some special bus for the HKGA. It was just your normal run of the mill bus with an ad for HKGA. You have no idea how excited I was to see it at the time. Haha. I probably even looked a little crazy to the people around as I&#8217;m pointing excitedly and trying to tell my family to look at the epicness painted on the bus.<br />
Now if anyone has visited the HKGA website, you&#8217;ll notice that it&#8217;s entirely in Chinese without any English version. And while I may be able to read and write Mandarin, trying to read a web page full of Chinese is a huge struggle for me since my Chinese is still rather basic.<br />
One of the things I noticed on the site was that there were classes being held at night throughout the week. They would cost money, but that didn&#8217;t bother me since it would be a brand new experience for me. So I had my mom call them (because I can&#8217;t speak Cantonese), and we find out that the classes were not actually running at the time.<br />
When my mom told me that, I then asked if they had a time where local players would come and play. As you might imagine, I was envisioning the HKGA to be something like the Nihon Ki-in in Japan where there&#8217;s a go salon in the building with a bunch of people playing throughout the day. To my surprise and disappointment, the secretary told my mom that they didn&#8217;t have anything like that.<br />
I was pretty bummed to hear that. After all, would my epic go adventure in Hong Kong be reduced to simply visiting the HKGA and maybe taking a few pictures? All hope was nearly gone until the secretary told my mom that I could take private lessons if I wanted to.<br />
After some back and forth, I found out that my teacher would be an amateur who was around 6-7 dan. He could speak Mandarin and English as well, so language wouldn&#8217;t be an issue. The only obstacle in my way was that it would be about $100USD for a lesson.<br />
I wrestled with the decision for a while. After all, $100USD is not cheap by any stretch of the imagination. However, for those who don&#8217;t know me, I&#8217;m more of the seize life by the moment kind of person. Since I had no idea when I would go back to Hong Kong, I ultimately decided to schedule a lesson for the next day in the morning at 10:00AM.<br />
The next day, I woke up excited to embark on my go adventure. My mom asked if I knew where I was going, and I told her that I had the address (252 Hennessy Road; Wan Chai; Hong Kong) already. I had confirmed it via Google maps and also a redditor had also told me the same address. Just to be safe though, my family was kind enough to be willing to go with me (in case I needed help getting around), so off we went.<br />
<figure id="attachment_5045" style="width: 640px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014HKP3-03.jpg"><img class="size-large wp-image-5045" alt="2014HKP3-03" src="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014HKP3-03-1024x682.jpg?resize=640%2C426" width="640" height="426" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">In Hong Kong, this is the symbol for the metro / subway line. If you see this, there is one very close by.</figcaption></figure>
After grabbing breakfast, we found ourselves the nearest metro line and headed off towards 252 Hennessy Road; Wan Chai; Hong Kong.<br />
<figure id="attachment_5046" style="width: 640px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014HKP3-04.jpg"><img class="size-large wp-image-5046" alt="2014HKP3-04" src="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014HKP3-04-1024x768.jpg?resize=640%2C480" width="640" height="480" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">The metro system is also way better than DC. Look. They have a map with electronic LED&#8217;s to show you where you are and what stop is next. Brilliant!</figcaption></figure>
Because I didn&#8217;t want to be late, we arrived with plenty of time to spare (around 9:30AM).<br />
<figure id="attachment_5047" style="width: 640px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014HKP3-05.jpg"><img class="size-large wp-image-5047" alt="2014HKP3-05" src="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014HKP3-05-1024x768.jpg?resize=640%2C480" width="640" height="480" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Woohoo! Here we are! The Hong Kong Go Association at 252 Hennessy Road; Wan Chai; Hong Kong.</figcaption></figure>
After finding the location, I turned around to look for the doorway and was instead greeted by a kind of creepy looking entrance.<br />
<figure id="attachment_5048" style="width: 384px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014HKP3-06.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-5048 " alt="2014HKP3-06" src="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014HKP3-06-768x1024.jpg?resize=384%2C512" width="384" height="512" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Tell me I&#8217;m not the only one who thought this looked like a scene out of a horror movie like Saw or something&#8230;</figcaption></figure>
After buzzing and waiting around for 15-20 minutes, I got a little nervous as I was wondering whether or not the teacher had bailed on me. I had tried to sneak into the metal door earlier to go in and see if anyone was around, but I got chased out by some elderly Asian gentlemen (who seemed to be the security guard). He told me that no one was upstairs and that no one was planning on being there. Uh oh&#8230;<br />
Around 9:55AM, we get a call from the secretary my mom spoke to last night. She asked if we were still coming. &#8220;Still coming?&#8221; my mom said, &#8220;We&#8217;re waiting outside!&#8221; After about ten seconds had passed, a feeling of dread washed over me&#8230; Sure enough, my mom turns to be and says, &#8220;We&#8217;re in the wrong location! This is not the correct place! They are actually located around the place we were eating breakfast!&#8221;<br />
<figure id="attachment_5074" style="width: 330px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/nooooooo_luke_skywalker.gif"><img class="size-full wp-image-5074" alt="Noooooo!!!!!!" src="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/nooooooo_luke_skywalker.gif?resize=330%2C186" width="330" height="186" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Noooooo!!!!!!</figcaption></figure>
<p style="text-align: left;">Needless to say I was utterly blown and felt terrible since someone had come to teach me and I was about 20-30 minutes away from where they were. Luckily however, the teacher was not in a rush to leave and was willing to wait for me to go to the correct location.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">At this point, I had dragged my family on a 30 minute journey to a new part of the city. I could not bear the notion of dragging them 30 minutes back just so I could go to the HKGA. So  so I told them to go ahead and stay and explore the new part of the city. And with that, I ran off to find the place myself.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">So if you&#8217;re wondering at this point, this is the correct address: <strong>12/F, May May Building, No. 683-685 Nathan Road, Mongkok</strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">After navigating my way back to Mongkok, I started looking for the sign that would signal me that I had found the building.</p>
<figure id="attachment_5049" style="width: 640px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014HKP3-07.jpg"><img class="size-large wp-image-5049" alt="2014HKP3-07" src="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014HKP3-07-1024x768.jpg?resize=640%2C480" width="640" height="480" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">This is it! In case you ever are visiting, this is the sign you should look for!</figcaption></figure>
<figure id="attachment_5050" style="width: 384px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014HKP3-08.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-5050" alt="2014HKP3-08" src="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014HKP3-08-768x1024.jpg?resize=384%2C512" width="384" height="512" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Here&#8217;s a shot of the entrance to let you know you&#8217;ve found the building. Much better than the other location right? Seems much more trustworthy.</figcaption></figure>
I was a bit out of breath by this point, but I was sure glad I had found the building within a reasonable time. And before I knew it I was riding the elevator up to the 12th floor.<br />
When the door opened, I was immediately greeted by a display case full of go memorabilia along with trophies and awards.<br />
<figure id="attachment_5051" style="width: 640px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014HKP3-09.jpg"><img class="size-large wp-image-5051" alt="2014HKP3-09" src="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014HKP3-09-1024x768.jpg?resize=640%2C480" width="640" height="480" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Stamps, signed fans, bowls, trophies etc. It was quite a sight!</figcaption></figure>
And after greeting the secretary at the front and exchanging the customary greeting and welcome, I turned left to see an incredible sight of go boards and bowls galore!<br />
<figure id="attachment_5052" style="width: 640px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014HKP3-11.jpg"><img class="size-large wp-image-5052" alt="2014HKP3-11" src="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014HKP3-11-1024x768.jpg?resize=640%2C480" width="640" height="480" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Isn&#8217;t this a magnificent sight? The only thing that would make it better would be people playing as well!</figcaption></figure>
Up on the left in the same room, there was a cork board where all the members had these mini tags with their names on it and hung by their respective rank.<br />
<figure id="attachment_5053" style="width: 640px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014HKP3-12.jpg"><img class="size-large wp-image-5053" alt="2014HKP3-12" src="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014HKP3-12-1024x768.jpg?resize=640%2C480" width="640" height="480" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Look at all those players! Each little tag is a person! If only I could have met and played one of them!</figcaption></figure>
In terms of my lesson that day, it turned out that I would be learning from the President of the Hong Kong Go Association himself! (I will refer to him as Shiu Lao Shi from this point on.)<br />
<figure id="attachment_5054" style="width: 640px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014HKP3-13.jpg"><img class="size-large wp-image-5054" alt="2014HKP3-13" src="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014HKP3-13-1024x768.jpg?resize=640%2C480" width="640" height="480" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">As you can see, my stuff is setup on the right table. This was where we had our lesson.</figcaption></figure>
For the first part of our lesson, we went over concepts regarding opening theory (i.e, fuseki). While this is a topic I have studied a bit overall (compared to other aspects of go), I was of course humbled by how Shiu Lao Shi was able to remind me of some fundamental principles when it came to fuseki.<br />
One of the key ideas I was taught was how the opening was a lot about balance. If you can get an even result, then you have done a good job with the fuseki. Too often players try to get some massive advantage and then end up in a bad position. This is still something I&#8217;m working on, but it was a much needed reminder since I&#8217;m an aggressive and impatient player as a whole.<br />
After more fuseki study, we played a 5-stone handicap game. Due to time constraints, I was not able to record the game. However, although I never got to spend the time I would have liked to try to recreate the full game, here is a partial kifu that I tried to recreate that day.*<br />
*Note: There is no commentary on this kifu due to how short it is, but I thought that being able to see how the game started up would be better than nothing.<br />

<p style="text-align: left;">After the lesson, I got to explore a little bit more and found their magnificent book collection.</p>
<figure id="attachment_5055" style="width: 640px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014HKP3-14.jpg"><img class="size-large wp-image-5055" alt="2014HKP3-14" src="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014HKP3-14-1024x768.jpg?resize=640%2C480" width="640" height="480" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Isn&#8217;t this massive? All Chinese books though! If only we had this many English go books&#8230;.</figcaption></figure>
Before I came to the HKGA, I had also envisioned that there might be a store or a pile of books where I could purchase something for me to remember the place by. Unfortunately all their books were on a loan basis only (which I would obviously not be doing since I&#8217;d never return it haha), and there was no &#8220;gift shop.&#8221; However, though I didn&#8217;t know it at the time, I was very lucky in that Shiu Lao Shi had no intentions of letting me leave empty handed.<br />
After walking around the HKGA a bit more and chatting with Shiu Lao Shi, I went up to the front desk to pay for the lesson. Next thing I know, Shiu Lao Shi was asking the secretary to give me a souvenir bag. The following are shots of the very generous gift that he ended up giving me.<br />

As you can imagine, I was very grateful and thanked him numerous times for such a generous gift. After all, I had expected to leave the HKGA with nothing but a good story and what I could carry in my brain. So I was like a little kid on Christmas when he gave me all of these souvenirs for me to bring home with me.<br />
<figure id="attachment_5068" style="width: 384px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014HKP3-27.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-5068" alt="2014HKP3-27" src="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014HKP3-27-810x1024.jpg?resize=384%2C485" width="384" height="485" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Here&#8217;s a shot of me and Shiu Lao Shi by the front desk.</figcaption></figure>
When the time came to part ways, we exchanged contact information and said our good-byes. I was certainly sad to leave since I would have loved to have stayed all day, but time was ticking and I had to go meet my family afterwards.<br />
Overall, I was glad that I was able to visit the HKGA and have a chance to learn from Shiu Lao Shi. It was a great experience and I certainly hope that I&#8217;ll be able to go back one day and play with other locals in the area. Maybe I&#8217;ll attend a tournament or something&#8230; you never know what the future holds&#8230; =)</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Conclusion</h2>
<p>With all that said and done, I hope that you enjoyed my Hong Kong series and felt that you could get a glimpse into my adventures in Hong Kong. As always, any feedback you have for me would be greatly appreciated. And if you ever have any questions or plan to go to Hong Kong yourself, please let me know and I&#8217;d be happy to chat with you!</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Introduction</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">When it comes to traveling, my number one priority is always to find the most authentic food to that area. The more special it is to the area (aka I can&#8217;t get it anywhere else in the world) the better. And for those who aren&#8217;t following me on <a href="http://www.twitter.com/bengozen">Twitter</a> already, you&#8217;ll notice that my Twitter consists primarily of go and food. So as you might expect, I&#8217;m quite enthusiastic about food and thus this post is a tad lengthier than normal.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">With that said, I hope you prepare yourself as you set off with me to relive my food adventures through Hong Kong, and be sure to read to the end because I recount my experience with a buffet that costs $100USD per person. No that is not a typo. See you at the the bottom!</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Part 2 &#8211; The Food</h2>
<p>For starters, I&#8217;ll have to say that while we had some recommendations on places to go, my family and I were mostly on our own when it came to figuring out what we wanted to eat.<br />
When we had finally escaped surviving on airplane food for the last 13+ hours, you can imagine our desire to find some actual food. Nothing microwaved or mushy. Just legit Hong Kong food. And even though it took us a bit before we got settled in at our hotel, we were fortune enough that there were some places open nearby. To top it off, we were incredibly lucky to pick the one place where they had excellent wonton egg noodle soup. Definitely the best I had the entire trip!<br />
<figure id="attachment_4966" style="width: 384px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014HKP2-01.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-4966" alt="2014HKP2-01" src="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014HKP2-01-768x1024.jpg?resize=384%2C512" width="384" height="512" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Best wonton egg noodle soup dish I had the entire trip!</figcaption></figure>
<span id="more-4953"></span><br />
One thing I learned about Hong Kong is that all of the breakfast (at least in the restaurant I went to) they served were primarily soup. After eating a rather abysmal breakfast one time, we eventually found this number nearby our hotel which had a great pork chop that went really well with instant noodles. I know I know&#8230; instant noodles? Well after my first terrible breakfast experience, instant noodles were a huge relief.<br />
<figure id="attachment_4967" style="width: 384px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014HKP2-02.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-4967" alt="2014HKP2-02" src="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014HKP2-02-819x1024.jpg?resize=384%2C480" width="384" height="480" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">This dish saved a number of breakfast that trip. There just wasn&#8217;t much else to choose from.</figcaption></figure>
In addition, another thing I came to like in Hong Kong was a drink that was quite common there: tea with lemon and honey! And while that might sound extremely common place, it was rather odd for me to experience that in an Asian restaurant.<br />
<figure id="attachment_4968" style="width: 384px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014HKP2-03.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-4968" alt="2014HKP2-03" src="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014HKP2-03-768x1024.jpg?resize=384%2C512" width="384" height="512" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">They serve it hot or cold, but after trying both I found that I prefer the cold one.</figcaption></figure>
One place that was recommended by my friend Christine was this dim sum place. As you can see below, it was really crowded and hopping!<br />
<figure id="attachment_4969" style="width: 640px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014HKP2-04.jpg"><img class="size-large wp-image-4969" alt="2014HKP2-04" src="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014HKP2-04-1024x767.jpg?resize=640%2C479" width="640" height="479" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Look at all those people! You can imagine how long the wait for a table might have been. Haha.</figcaption></figure>
After waiting for a while though, we were finally seated and the dim sum feast began!<br />

The next restaurant to be featured is a dessert place that was also near our hotel (we had gotten quite lucky to be around so many good food places within walking distance). We had passed by it a number of times walking around, but never went in because it was so crowded. One night however, it was just my dad and I and we decided to go ahead and see what the buzz was all about.<br />
<figure id="attachment_4975" style="width: 640px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014HKP2-10.jpg"><img class="size-large wp-image-4975" alt="2014HKP2-10" src="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014HKP2-10-1024x767.jpg?resize=640%2C479" width="640" height="479" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Xiao Fang Tang &#8211; The customer base was primarily the younger generation (i.e., teens to people in their twenties), and man it was crowded!

When we went to visit Tian Tan Buddha, we got a chance to try the temple&#8217;s vegetarian feast as well!<br />
<figure id="attachment_4982" style="width: 640px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014HKP2-17.jpg"><img class="size-large wp-image-4982" alt="2014HKP2-17" src="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014HKP2-17-1024x682.jpg?resize=640%2C426" width="640" height="426" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Here&#8217;s the entrance into the temple&#8217;s restaurant.</figcaption></figure>

<figure id="attachment_4989" style="width: 640px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014HKP2-24.jpg"><img class="size-large wp-image-4989" alt="2014HKP2-24" src="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014HKP2-24-1024x767.jpg?resize=640%2C479" width="640" height="479" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">This here is a regular milk tea from the McCafe with the Chinese character for tea sprinkled over the foam with Himalayan spice. It was actually surprisingly good when you consider the fact it was from McDonalds! Haha.</figcaption></figure>
Another fun thing I got to try in Hong Kong was cream soda (depicted below). I know that this might be a regular occurrence to some in the States, but my aunt told me she grew up drinking it so I decided to give it a shot. It was a new flavor and quite an interesting taste! Not something I could drink all the time, but I could see why people really enjoy it.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014HKP2-25.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-4990" alt="2014HKP2-25" src="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014HKP2-25-768x1024.jpg?resize=384%2C512" width="384" height="512" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"> Another thing about Hong Kong is that the airport is HUGE. And maybe I&#8217;m just ignorant from having only really spent time in airports in the United States, but there was just so many food options (that were actually good)! For instance, this place (below) featured an entree not found in many other places.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><a href="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014HKP2-26.jpg"><img alt="2014HKP2-26" src="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014HKP2-26-1024x767.jpg?resize=640%2C479" width="640" height="479" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>

Definitely a unique dish. It&#8217;s one I would recommend to people who like eating duck. Otherwise, probably want to steer clear.</figcaption></figure>
And of course, while at the airport, I also took the chance to grab me some milk tea whenever I had the chance!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014HKP2-28.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-4993" alt="2014HKP2-28" src="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014HKP2-28-768x1024.jpg?resize=384%2C512" width="384" height="512" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">And on the last day, I even got a chance to try the ramen at the airport. I have to say that I was a little skeptical of how good it could be. After all, it was in an airport. It can&#8217;t be that authentic right?</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014HKP2-29.jpg"><img class="size-large wp-image-4994 aligncenter" alt="2014HKP2-29" src="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014HKP2-29-1024x767.jpg?resize=640%2C479" width="640" height="479" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Yeah I was completely wrong. For airport standards, this ramen was awesome if you needed some real food before going to the terminal!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014HKP2-30.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-4995" alt="2014HKP2-30" src="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014HKP2-30-1024x767.jpg?resize=640%2C479" width="640" height="479" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>

<p style="text-align: center;">Another favorite of mine is the franchise known as Hui Lau San (depicted below). They serve drinks that are more fruit oriented.</p>

As always, I have saved the best for last. On one night, my family and I were very fortunate to be able to [partake in an incredible experience at a restaurant called Imasa. It was by reservation only (which my cousin was able to get for us on short notice) where their buffet was $100 USD per person.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014HKP2-35.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-5001" alt="2014HKP2-35" src="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014HKP2-35-1024x767.jpg?resize=640%2C479" width="640" height="479" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Yep&#8230; That&#8217;s right. $100 USD per person. And even though the price seemed outrageous to me at the time, what I will say is that it was worth every penny. I have never had food that was elevated to such a level I&#8217;d never experienced before. Anyhow, more on that later&#8230;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">To begin, we start with the setting of the table for every person. As you can see, there&#8217;s a small thing of wasabi, a place to rest your chopsticks and soup spoon so they don&#8217;t have to touch the table, a hot towel, and a cup of tea that never went empty because they always refilled it after you drank about 30% of it.</p>

To clarify real quick before progressing, while this was a buffet in the traditional sense, they also featured special entrees that were limited to one per person due to the extremely high quality dish they were serving you (i.e., <a title="Wagyu Wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wagyu">Wagyu beef</a>).<br />
Now we begin the tour of the buffet bar&#8230;<br />

When I had that first bite of sashimi, I have to tell you that it was literally out of this world. I am a huge sushi fan and had my fair share of sashimi, but I had never had anything so incredible before. The fish just tasted so sweet and fresh while being so incredibly tender and practically melting in your mouth. In fact, even things like squid sashimi (which I despise to eat here in the US because of how rubbery it normally is) was actually enjoyable!<br />
<figure id="attachment_5018" style="width: 640px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014HKP2-52.jpg"><img class="size-large wp-image-5018" alt="2014HKP2-52" src="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014HKP2-52-1024x767.jpg?resize=640%2C479" width="640" height="479" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">My second plate with assorted sashimi and sushi!</figcaption></figure>
Some of the new delicacies I got to try here was &#8220;sweet shrimp&#8221; and &#8220;scallops&#8221; sashimi. I had never had shrimp or scallop raw before, but like I mentioned earlier, the freshness of these ingredients were so incredible that I just couldn&#8217;t get enough!<br />
<figure id="attachment_5019" style="width: 640px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014HKP2-53.jpg"><img class="size-large wp-image-5019" alt="2014HKP2-53" src="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014HKP2-53-1024x767.jpg?resize=640%2C479" width="640" height="479" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Here&#8217;s umami over a cucumber!</figcaption></figure>
Even things like umami (i.e., sea urchin) which I normally don&#8217;t care for was actually quite savory and tasty!<br />
<figure id="attachment_5020" style="width: 640px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014HKP2-54.jpg"><img class="size-large wp-image-5020" alt="2014HKP2-54" src="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014HKP2-54-1024x767.jpg?resize=640%2C479" width="640" height="479" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Dried puffer fish jerky &#8211; It was really tasty! Couldn&#8217;t get enough of it!</figcaption></figure>
And to top it off, because we were with my cousin, we got to try this special dish (that wasn&#8217;t part of the buffet and had to be ordered separately) which many of you probably know about: the puffer fish! Now while it wasn&#8217;t raw (which would then run the risk of me dying from eating it), it was awesome to be able to get to try the actual fish itself.<br />
As you&#8217;ll see over the next few photos, I go back quite a bit to keep getting different things and see what new flavors and tastes the restaurant had waiting for me. Time and time it continued to surprise me with things that I thought I wouldn&#8217;t like and ending up enjoying.</p>

Let&#8217;s just say it was probably the best one I&#8217;ve ever had thus far.</figcaption></figure>
<figure id="attachment_5025" style="width: 640px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014HKP2-59.jpg"><img class="size-large wp-image-5025" alt="2014HKP2-59" src="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014HKP2-59-1024x767.jpg?resize=640%2C479" width="640" height="479" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">We even got to try the hand rolls, but overall it was just the amazing sashimi just wrapped in the rice and seaweed. So in other words, just get the sashimi and skip the rice. Haha.</figcaption></figure>
Now we enter into the main entrees that was featured on the second page of the menu. You&#8217;ll notice I have shots of every single entree (even though it&#8217;s limit to one per person), but because my cousin was a frequent visitor there, we were able to get as many as we wanted.<br />
<figure id="attachment_5026" style="width: 640px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014HKP2-60.jpg"><img class="size-large wp-image-5026" alt="2014HKP2-60" src="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014HKP2-60-1024x767.jpg?resize=640%2C479" width="640" height="479" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Tuban shell teppanyaki</figcaption></figure>
<figure id="attachment_5027" style="width: 640px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014HKP2-61.jpg"><img class="size-large wp-image-5027" alt="2014HKP2-61" src="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014HKP2-61-1024x767.jpg?resize=640%2C479" width="640" height="479" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Grilled kinki fish with salt</figcaption></figure>
<figure id="attachment_5028" style="width: 640px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014HKP2-62.jpg"><img class="size-large wp-image-5028" alt="2014HKP2-62" src="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014HKP2-62-1024x767.jpg?resize=640%2C479" width="640" height="479" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Wagyu beef noodle soup</figcaption></figure>
<p style="text-align: center;">When I had that first bite of Wagyu beef, all I will say is that this was another one of those out of the world experiences. I have enjoyed my fair share of beef, steak and so forth, but the tenderness and flavor of the meat was simply mind blowing. I was practically speechless&#8230;</p>
<figure id="attachment_5029" style="width: 640px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014HKP2-63.jpg"><img class="size-large wp-image-5029" alt="2014HKP2-63" src="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014HKP2-63-1024x767.jpg?resize=640%2C479" width="640" height="479" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Red bean ice cream and hokkaido ice cream</figcaption></figure>
Now that we&#8217;ve started the dessert section, I have to also pay another tribute to the ice cream above. While ice cream is one of those common place desserts, I will have to say that red bean is just one of those things I have never liked growing up. Yet, to my surprise, I LOVED what they did with this ice cream and just couldn&#8217;t get enough (I even ordered a second one later on). Hahaha.<br />
<figure id="attachment_5030" style="width: 640px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014HKP2-64.jpg"><img class="size-large wp-image-5030" alt="2014HKP2-64" src="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014HKP2-64-1024x767.jpg?resize=640%2C479" width="640" height="479" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">As you can see here, I tried to jam my entire plate with everything I could grab from the dessert table. I don&#8217;t think there was anything I ate that was disappointing.</figcaption></figure>
<figure id="attachment_5031" style="width: 640px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014HKP2-65.jpg"><img class="size-large wp-image-5031" alt="2014HKP2-65" src="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014HKP2-65-1024x767.jpg?resize=640%2C479" width="640" height="479" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Finally, we had this pudding/jello dessert. And if you&#8217;re wondering what that gold leaf is on top, that isn&#8217;t just decoration. That&#8217;s actual gold! Talk about decadent!</figcaption></figure>
To be honest, I always thought that 5 star restaurants and such were just hyper-inflated prices of what people normally eat; but this restaurant certainly opened my eyes (and taste buds) to just how vastly deep the world of food can be. Sure, sometimes &#8220;5 star restaurants&#8221; are simply overpriced, but if you can find a gem like the one I got to try here, you might see (and taste) what I mean one day.<br />
Well, I hope that you enjoyed the small glimpse of my food adventures in Hong Kong. I was originally going to post everything that I had eaten, but it was something like 150+ photos and I knew it wasn&#8217;t realistic for me to try to fit that all in one post. So what you got to read above were the highlights of my adventure that I felt was worth your time.<br />
And tomorrow, the long wait is finally over, we conclude my Hong Kong trip series with my visit to the Hong Kong Go Association!</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Introduction</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">After much waiting and anticipation, I&#8217;m happy to finally release my Hong Kong post series! I originally had plans to do a day by day retelling of my adventures in Hong Kong, but I realized that it would take way too long to write and not to mention I would probably bore you to tears.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">In addition, since the trip wasn&#8217;t entirely centered on go, I wanted to capture as much of my trip as possible without taking too much time away from the main subject matter of this blog: go.  After all, as I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;ve noticed, I&#8217;ve worked hard to ensure that all my posts have always been related to go. So I hope you&#8217;ll forgive me for detracting from go these next couple of days to tell you about my trip. With that said, I hope you enjoy these posts!</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Part 1 &#8211; The Scenery</h2>
<p>The trip was a 13+ hour flight, so you can imagine our delight when we were finally off the plane and stepping foot into Hong Kong for the first time. After going through customs, getting our luggage, and a brief encounter of a taxi driver trying to hustle and get our family to take his taxi back to the city as opposed to the bus, we soon found ourselves on a bus driving down into the city.<br />
After about thirty minutes, we were driving through the city and I was greeted by the following view of Hong Kong for the first time:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014HKP1-01.jpg"><img class="size-large wp-image-4917 aligncenter" src="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014HKP1-01-1024x682.jpg?resize=640%2C426" alt="2014HKP1-01" width="640" height="426" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span id="more-4916"></span>Considering this is the first time my family and I have ever been to Hong Kong, it should be no surprise to you that we did a lot of exploring of the city. And even though I&#8217;ve been to my fair share of cities (i.e., Washington D.C., New York, Los Angeles, San Francisco), I have to say that Hong Kong was full of tall buildings.<br />
<figure id="attachment_4918" style="width: 384px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014HKP1-02.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-4918" src="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014HKP1-02-768x1024.jpg?resize=384%2C512" alt="2014HKP1-02" width="384" height="512" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">This building was so tall that I only managed to capture it using panoramic mode.</figcaption></figure>
And while one expect a city to be full of buildings, I couldn&#8217;t help but notice that Hong Kong had a lot of unique building designs sprinkled throughout as you would walk from place to place.<br />
<figure id="attachment_4919" style="width: 384px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014HKP1-03.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-4919" src="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014HKP1-03-768x1024.jpg?resize=384%2C512" alt="2014HKP1-03" width="384" height="512" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">The building on the left captured my attention for this shot. Isn&#8217;t it neat?</figcaption></figure>
One of the things that my brother wanted to do was visit The Peak (aka <a title="Victoria Peak Wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victoria_Peak">Victoria Peak</a> &#8211; which is a tourist location because it&#8217;s the tallest point in Hong Kong where you can see the entire city). So one night we decided to head up on our own (which was a fun adventure since neither of us spoke Cantonese), and after getting lost and nearly leaving the location (we thought we were in the wrong place but we were really just in the wrong building), we finally found ourselves at the right spot.<br />
<figure id="attachment_4920" style="width: 640px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014HKP1-04.jpg"><img class="size-large wp-image-4920" src="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014HKP1-04-1024x682.jpg?resize=640%2C426" alt="2014HKP1-04" width="640" height="426" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">For anyone coming to visit Victoria Peak, this is the building you&#8217;re looking for when you have the taxi take you up there. It is NOT the shopping mall that you first find yourself at when the taxi drops you at. Haha.</figcaption></figure>
My night photography skills need a lot of work, but here&#8217;s a semi-decent shot that I managed to get of the incredible view we had at the top.<br />
<figure id="attachment_4921" style="width: 640px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014HKP1-05.jpg"><img class="size-large wp-image-4921" src="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014HKP1-05-1024x682.jpg?resize=640%2C426" alt="2014HKP1-05" width="640" height="426" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Imagine that in real life&#8230; Although I will say that when I was leaning over the edge to take the picture, I looked down and my stomach immediately knotted up as I thought about what it would be like to fall down or drop my camera&#8230; *shudders*</figcaption></figure>
<figure id="attachment_4922" style="width: 640px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014HKP1-06.jpg"><img class="size-large wp-image-4922" src="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014HKP1-06-1024x682.jpg?resize=640%2C426" alt="2014HKP1-06" width="640" height="426" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Here&#8217;s a photo of my brother (on the left) and me (on the right).</figcaption></figure>
Another memorable aspect about Hong Kong is the fact that construction is going on EVERYWHERE. I swear, I don&#8217;t think I can recall a single time where I wasn&#8217;t walking down a street and not seeing some kind of construction going on. And to make it an even more memorable fact, a lot of the construction was done using bamboo structures to provide support.<br />
<figure id="attachment_4923" style="width: 640px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014HKP1-07.jpg"><img class="size-large wp-image-4923" src="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014HKP1-07-1024x767.jpg?resize=640%2C479" alt="2014HKP1-07" width="640" height="479" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Here&#8217;s a shot of the bamboo structures I was talking about. Though I&#8217;m aware of how strong bamboo can be, it was crazy seeing it being used as such a critical support structure for construction.</figcaption></figure>
Another thing that I noticed about Hong Kong is that while it lives up to what you expect of a city in terms of things being open late, everything that we went to in the morning (like shopping malls and such) were closed!!! In other words, it seems that the better approach for life in Hong Kong is to stay out real late, sleep-in, grab lunch, and then go out to do stuff. Haha.<br />
<figure id="attachment_4924" style="width: 640px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014HKP1-08.jpg"><img class="size-large wp-image-4924" src="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014HKP1-08-1024x767.jpg?resize=640%2C479" alt="2014HKP1-08" width="640" height="479" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">This was taken at a prominent mall called &#8220;The One.&#8221; It was like 11AM. Pretty much everything was closed&#8230; &gt;_&lt;</figcaption></figure>
After having gone to Times Square in New York, I have to say that I wasn&#8217;t expecting to be wowed by any LED lights or big fancy screens in Hong Kong; but I noticed some really gorgeous designs of Chinese characters shining brightly with LED lights.<br />
<figure id="attachment_4925" style="width: 384px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014HKP1-09.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-4925" src="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014HKP1-09-768x1024.jpg?resize=384%2C512" alt="2014HKP1-09" width="384" height="512" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">This is the Chinese character for &#8220;medicine.&#8221; As you can see, the calligraphy looks gorgeous even though it&#8217;s comprised of LED lights.</figcaption></figure>
The other big tourist thing my family and I did was to visit the <a title="Tian Tan Buddha Wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tian_Tan_Buddha">Tian Tan Buddha</a>. It was a bit of a journey to get up there; but after two long bus rides, we finally arrived.<br />
<figure id="attachment_4926" style="width: 640px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014HKP1-10.jpg"><img class="size-large wp-image-4926" src="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014HKP1-10-1024x682.jpg?resize=640%2C426" alt="2014HKP1-10" width="640" height="426" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">This was the view I was greeted with when we got off the bus.</figcaption></figure>
<figure id="attachment_4927" style="width: 640px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014HKP1-11.jpg"><img class="size-large wp-image-4927" src="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014HKP1-11-1024x682.jpg?resize=640%2C426" alt="2014HKP1-11" width="640" height="426" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">When you are about to enter, you are greeted with this majestic white gate.</figcaption></figure>
After walking in, we were taking in the sights and then promptly noticed two dogs that were just relaxing in the sun. The atmosphere was already very calming and zen-like to begin with, but seeing these dogs just made it that much more so.<br />
<figure id="attachment_4928" style="width: 640px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014HKP1-12.jpg"><img class="size-large wp-image-4928" src="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014HKP1-12-1024x682.jpg?resize=640%2C426" alt="2014HKP1-12" width="640" height="426" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">This dog was just taking a nap in the middle of the central area without a care in the world. Doesn&#8217;t he look so peaceful?</figcaption></figure>
<figure id="attachment_4929" style="width: 640px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014HKP1-13.jpg"><img class="size-large wp-image-4929" src="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014HKP1-13-1024x682.jpg?resize=640%2C426" alt="2014HKP1-13" width="640" height="426" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">This dog was just chilling on the front steps and peering out as if calmly observing everything going around him.</figcaption></figure>
Before we headed up the long stairs to the Buddha statue, I experimented with my camera a bit.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014HKP1-14.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-4930" src="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014HKP1-14-1024x682.jpg?resize=640%2C426" alt="2014HKP1-14" width="640" height="426" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>

<p style="text-align: left;">After a long trek up multiple flights of stairs, we were finally greeted by the immense statue of Tian Tan Buddha.</p>
<figure id="attachment_4932" style="width: 640px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014HKP1-16.jpg"><img class="size-large wp-image-4932" src="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014HKP1-16-1024x682.jpg?resize=640%2C426" alt="2014HKP1-16" width="640" height="426" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">It&#8217;s so big!!!!</figcaption></figure>
After walking around and going in to the museum (which I am unfortunately unable to feature on this post since no photography was allowed), I had a chance to explore around the area on my own for a bit and took a couple of shots.<br />
<figure id="attachment_4933" style="width: 640px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014HKP1-17.jpg"><img class="size-large wp-image-4933" src="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014HKP1-17-1024x682.jpg?resize=640%2C426" alt="2014HKP1-17" width="640" height="426" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">This was taken from the side of the Buddha looking out into the open. Doesn&#8217;t it look so serene?</figcaption></figure>
<figure id="attachment_4934" style="width: 640px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014HKP1-18.jpg"><img class="size-large wp-image-4934" src="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014HKP1-18-1024x682.jpg?resize=640%2C426" alt="2014HKP1-18" width="640" height="426" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Here&#8217;s a favorite of mine from the side of the Buddha statue.</figcaption></figure>
<figure id="attachment_4945" style="width: 640px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014HKP1-19.jpg"><img class="size-large wp-image-4945" src="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014HKP1-19-1024x682.jpg?resize=640%2C426" alt="2014HKP1-19" width="640" height="426" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">A shot of the Buddha from below.</figcaption></figure>
Once we had finished visiting the Buddha statue, we went to visit the rest of the temple and see what else was in the area.<br />
<figure id="attachment_4936" style="width: 640px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014HKP1-20.jpg"><img class="size-large wp-image-4936" src="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014HKP1-20-1024x682.jpg?resize=640%2C426" alt="2014HKP1-20" width="640" height="426" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Here&#8217;s a shot of a plant that bloomed into a lotus shape.</figcaption></figure>
<figure id="attachment_4937" style="width: 640px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014HKP1-21.jpg"><img class="size-large wp-image-4937" src="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014HKP1-21-1024x682.jpg?resize=640%2C426" alt="2014HKP1-21" width="640" height="426" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">The view of a temple from the bottom steps.</figcaption></figure>

<figure id="attachment_4939" style="width: 640px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014HKP1-23.jpg"><img class="size-large wp-image-4939" src="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014HKP1-23-1024x682.jpg?resize=640%2C426" alt="2014HKP1-23" width="640" height="426" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">This was a tree where people could hang wishes and such on there.</figcaption></figure>

While Hong Kong was not a huge culture shock to me in regards to living standards (i.e., not much different from what you&#8217;d expect after living in the U.S.), it was still a magnificent cultural experience. And even though I was in Hong Kong for about 10 days, I still feel as if I&#8217;ve only experienced and saw only a fraction of what it had to offer.<br />
I hope that this post offered you a glimpse into the wonders that Hong Kong has to offer, but don&#8217;t worry, our journey is not yet done. Tomorrow I have a rather scrumptious post for you, so get your salivating glands ready!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/02/kurokisitescreenshot.png"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-4681" src="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/02/kurokisitescreenshot.png?resize=392%2C354" alt="kurokisitescreenshot" width="392" height="354" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>Though I&#8217;ve never explicitly stated this, one of my goals with this blog is to bring the most exciting and interesting stories about go that I think anyone with even only the slightest interest in go would enjoy while documenting my own journey. I try not to replicate the amazing work done by <a href="http://www.gogameguru.com/">GoGameGuru</a> and others who document the details of the professional world and serve as a better source for those intricacies of the go world.<br />
So in light of that, I am really excited to introduce the very first guest post on this blog! For those who<span style="line-height: 1.5em;"> don&#8217;t know, there&#8217;s an active forum on go called <a href="http://www.lifein19x19.com/">Life in 19&#215;19</a>, and I came across a magnificent post on a tour of the shop of Mr. Kuroki (who owns the </span><a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="http://www.kurokigoishi.co.jp/english/">Kuroki Goishi Ten</a><span style="line-height: 1.5em;"> shop which sells high quality equipment). It reminded me of </span><a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="http://chiyodad.blogspot.com/2007/04/yunzi-manufacturing-and-books-from.html">ChiyoDad&#8217;s post on yunzi manufacturing</a><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">, so I immediately contacted the author and requested his permission to repost his post here on the blog in order to further spread word of his awesome trip. And since you&#8217;re reading this, it shouldn&#8217;t surprise you to hear that I got permission! So without further delay, hope you enjoy <a href="http://lifein19x19.com/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=2341&amp;sid=a4e3128c00299b30319d260ced9ea0b3">Erythen&#8217;s</a> virtual tour through Mr. Kuroki&#8217;s shop!</span><br />

A few people have expressed interest in seeing my photos of Mr. Kuroki&#8217;s shop/factory in Hyuga, Japan. For those interested, I&#8217;ll intersperse the pictures with commentary.<br />
Prior to leaving Japan I went on one last two week road trip. I debated with myself whether or not to visit Mr. Kuroki&#8217;s factory in Hyuga by the time I reached Kyushu. It&#8217;s not that I didn&#8217;t want to go, but the city is well off the beaten path, and everything else I really wanted to see was on the other side of the island. Nonetheless, curiosity got the better of me and I made the detour.<br />
It took a little while to find his shop, even though it&#8217;s located on the city&#8217;s main road. My difficulties arose from the simple fact that I didn&#8217;t really know what to expect and thus didn&#8217;t know what to look for. After driving around town I found the shop nestled between a small hill and a river; the familiar black and white logo standing out to me.<br />
<a href="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/02/kuroki01.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4684" src="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/02/kuroki01.jpg?resize=600%2C800" alt="kuroki01" width="600" height="800" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><br />
I knew I&#8217;d found the right place, if for nothing else than the scent of Kaya working it&#8217;s way around the parking lot. Near the main entrance there&#8217;s a small building where the board artisan works. I had a chance to visit with him but didn&#8217;t want to disrupt his shift too much so let him continue. Later in the day, Mr. Kuroki brought me back when I expressed interest, and I had a chance to see him apply the grid to a beautiful shogi floorboard. Sadly, by that time though my camera&#8217;s battery was quite low and I didn&#8217;t get a chance to photograph it. Fortunately, I managed to take some snapshots of a few unfinished composite go boards.<br />

<a href="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/02/kuroki04.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4687" src="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/02/kuroki04.jpg?resize=720%2C540" alt="kuroki04" width="720" height="540" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><br />
Walking into the main building, one is bombarded by the sweet, subtle scent of Kaya. It surprised me how small the shop itself was. I don&#8217;t know why, but I expected something much larger. Dozens of Kaya boards lined the walls to the north and east, while a large table showing a few of the less expensive Kaya and Katsura boards dominated the center next to a small space for waiting guests. To the far west a myriad of go bowls stood on display. A large glass case rested next to the door on the south showing various some of the more pricey boards and a small selection of shogi equipment.<br />

I&#8217;m not sure about the others that I pictured, but I do know that this Hyuga Kaya board is still for sale. On the website, scroll down the Hyuga Kaya masame boards and you&#8217;ll see it currently priced at 980,000 yen. I apologize in advance, but my camera focused on the display case and not the board, but you can still see how nice it is.<br />

Walking around the shop you enter an Omiage store. It doesn&#8217;t really have anything to do with Go so I didn&#8217;t take any pictures. This section mostly caters to the various tourist buses that pass through town on their way to someplace more exciting. While Hyuga is of interest to Go connoisseurs, there really isn&#8217;t much else there.<br />
Walking around the corner and ignoring the souvenir shop you enter a display area where one can see the actual factory and the stone construction process. In this photo, you see how stones are traditionally made. Most new stones aren&#8217;t manufactured in this way anymore, though from my understanding, Mr. Kuroki still processes the native Hyuga stones (at least the larger ones) in this hand-made fashion; after all, would you expect anything less for such aristocratic game pieces.<br />
<a href="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/02/kuroki10.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4693" src="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/02/kuroki10.jpg?resize=720%2C540" alt="kuroki10" width="720" height="540" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><br />
I don&#8217;t know what most of the machines in these next pictures do. Some punch the stones from the shells, others from the slate. A few work the stones down and others polish them. Again I apologize for the fuzziness of the images. My camera doesn&#8217;t do too well behind glass.<br />

These are what the stones look like when first cut from their shells. Mr. Kuroki has tens of thousands laying around the grounds near his shop. Whenever cuts are rejected, they just dump them around outside for decoration.<br />
<a href="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/02/kuroki17.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4700" src="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/02/kuroki17.jpg?resize=720%2C540" alt="kuroki17" width="720" height="540" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><br />
Finished stones that are accepted go through a sorting process. Grade and quality are determined and the shells are then put into storage until someone purchases them. From my understanding, they go through another quality check before being shipped out.<br />
<a href="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/02/kuroki18.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4701" src="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/02/kuroki18.jpg?resize=720%2C540" alt="kuroki18" width="720" height="540" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><br />

One of the things I found very interesting was the small display showing different levels of the manufacturing process. A lot more than a simple cut, shape and polish goes into the manufacturing process.<br />
<a href="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/02/kuroki21.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4704" src="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/02/kuroki21.jpg?resize=720%2C540" alt="kuroki21" width="720" height="540" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><br />
In the first photo here, you&#8217;ll see how the stones are cut from Mexican Clamshell and slate. In the second photo, you see the legendary Hyuga clamshell and how the stones are cut from these precious shells.<br />
<a href="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/02/kuroki22.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4705" src="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/02/kuroki22.jpg?resize=720%2C540" alt="kuroki22" width="720" height="540" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><br />
<a href="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/02/kuroki23.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4706" src="https://i0.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/02/kuroki23.jpg?resize=720%2C540" alt="kuroki23" width="720" height="540" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><br />
Mr. Kuroki sat me down and we discussed the differences in clamshell. Hyuga clams are very rare now and the larger shells for stones will probably be gone within 5 &#8211; 10 years (if even that). He mentioned the average lifespan of a clam near Hyuga was about 15 years, and in order to get decent stones, they would need to be about 20 years old. Finding shells large enough for stones is difficult in the best of times and now it&#8217;s almost impossible to find anything larger than size 30.<br />
He brought out a set of sized 40 snow grade hyuga stones for me to examine. I was almost afraid to touch the things because just one was worth more than I made in a month (and mind you, I wasn&#8217;t paid poorly while living in Japan). These stones can still be seen on his website (link provided below). For comparison, to the left you&#8217;ll see a Mexican clamshell and to the right, a Hyuga clamshell. In the center are those most valuable of go stones.<br />

<a href="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/02/kuroki24.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4707" src="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2014/02/kuroki24.jpg?resize=720%2C540" alt="kuroki24" width="720" height="540" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><br />
Mr. Kuroki was a very kind man an treated me like royalty. Above the shop is a rather large all you can eat restaurant and he offered to treat me to a nice meal. It was a pleasure to have an excellent conversation with him while we ate. His English isn&#8217;t the best, but then again neither is my Japanese. Between our broken English/Japanese however, we were able to conduct a very nice discussion.<br />
He was very surprised that some random Caucasian guy would come visit his shop. He told me that those who visited were usually &#8220;rich man or old man.&#8221; In the end, my time was well worth the detour, and I&#8217;m very glad to have had a chance to meet the man behind the website.<br />
My last photo is of my guide, Mr. Kuroki himself. Being of the unphotogenic type I cut myself from the picture:).<br />
I hope you&#8217;d enjoyed this virtual tour through the finest of Japan&#8217;s go stone factories.<br />
For those who are interested in further information, I found this link from the Russian Go Federation. It&#8217;s an interview with Mr. Kuroki.<br />
