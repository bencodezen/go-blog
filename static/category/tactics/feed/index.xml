Counting (i.e., estimating territory at any point in the game). Although this is a skill that many would say is critical to improving the consistency of your games, this is probably the skill that is most avoided by go players all around. For those who are not aware of the benefits of counting, it boils down to one simple principle: <strong>It provides guidance as to how aggressively/defensively you should be playing</strong>.<br />
<span id="more-1586"></span><br />
For example, if you are ahead by 30 points on the board, the best thing to do is to solidify your positions and reduce the possibility of your opponent successively invading and destroying your territory. Without counting, you might make overplays and take unnecessary risks that could allow your opponent to turn the game around. On the other hand, if you are behind, you better start invading or doing whatever you can to change the flow of the game.<br />
With that benefit, you must be asking yourself, why doesn&#8217;t everyone do it then?</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>It is a time consuming process. </strong>Whether it&#8217;s trying to determine whether you can kill your opponent&#8217;s group, or whether you can win that capturing race, most players (myself included) are so preoccupied with the tactical aspects of go that counting rarely makes the cut when managing our time.</li>
<li><strong>Counting is not as simple as 1 + 1 = 2. </strong>While estimating territory may seem rather easy, it requires a fundamental understanding of where realistic territory exists and what is still undecided. As any player is well aware, the game can be decided by as little as half a point. So overestimation/underestimation can obviously have a huge impact on the result of the game. As a result, the haziness of estimating territory only serves to scare more players away.</li>
<li><strong>The board is constantly changing.</strong> This further discourages players from counting since it&#8217;s difficult to predict where the opponent will go next.</li>
</ol>
<p>Fortunately, all hope is not lost! Although this may seem rather self-explanatory, it is important to remember that the key word to remember when counting is that you are <strong>estimating</strong>. If you can get yourself to within 10 points of the actual score, you are far better off than most amateur players.<br />
In terms of how you can improve your counting abilities, here are some tips to get you started:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Don&#8217;t spend any longer than a minute counting. </strong>If you are spending more time, you are being too exact.</li>
<li><strong>Count in pairs.</strong> This will allow you to count at a much faster pace.</li>
<li><strong>Don&#8217;t count anything that looks questionable.</strong> If it looks like either player can jump in and easily live/escape, throw that territory out the window.</li>
<li><strong>Create a blueprint.</strong> In an ideal world, you would be able to easily remember how much each territory is. For most of us though, we will find ourselves forgetting or confusing how much each section is worth. So to build up to the skill of being able to remember it all, create a quick sketch of the board with your first estimations when you first count, and then modify it accordingly the next time you count.</li>
<li><strong>Compare your estimation with a stronger player&#8217;s estimation.</strong> This can be a huge benefit to helping you understand how to make more accurate decisions regarding how to estimate the score.</li>
</ol>
<p>Like any other skill in life, do not be discouraged if your counting skills are off. The key thing is to keep practicing and making it a habit. Start by counting just once per game, and then increase it to two when you feel comfortable doing so. I assure you that you will definitely get faster over time.<br />
Finally, there is one final matter that must be addressed: estimating score using software. While this is a really convenient tool, it is important to realize that it is far from perfect. I have seen the software mistaken large groups for dead when they are clearly alive. As a result, remember that it is not something you should use as a reference point.<br />
If you have any tips or exercises that helped you improve your counting abilities, please be sure to share it below!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Blank.png"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-988" title="Empty Board" src="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Blank-300x300.png?resize=300%2C300" alt="Empty Board by Eidogo" width="300" height="300" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Go Problem: Black to play and win.</em></p>
<p>For those who are skeptical of the importance of the correct approach to studying tsumego, let&#8217;s consider the following:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">#1. <strong>Your reading ability is the primary foundation for your go ability.</strong> If you can&#8217;t read worth diddly squat, don&#8217;t expect to get any stronger.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">#2. <strong>It&#8217;s the most convenient form of go that is available to players if they&#8217;re unable to play an actual game.</strong> So why not make it an enjoyable activity that will help you get stronger?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">#3. Finally, since most go players will spend a good portion of their time on tsumego, <strong>it is only logical that you would want to maximize the growth you&#8217;ll get from the time and energy you spend on it</strong>.</p>
<p>That being said. Let&#8217;s dive right into how one should properly study tsumego.<br />
<strong>#1. As a rule of thumb, spend at least 75% of your time on easy problems.</strong>*</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"> If you primarily focus on hard problems, there are three issues that will arise.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">A. You will get frustrated because you are going to be wrong most of the time and will be unable to see why you&#8217;re wrong. Therefore, you will not learn or gain much.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">B. Although you would think that learning how to solve hard problems would result in you being able to solve easy problems, this is rarely the case for tsumego.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">C. Finally, you must understand that every game of go you play consists of a majority of easy to intermediate level problems, and then a handful of complicated situations. So instead of understanding the proper moves to make for most of the game and being a little lost for only a small part of the game, you hope to win a game where you make mistakes during the majority of the game and make the occassional correct move for a small part of the game? You might want to think twice about this approach if you want to win any games.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">With that in mind, isn&#8217;t the only logical thing to do is train your intuition so that your basics become flawless? After all, once the basics become instinctual, you will not even have to consider the trivial moves that once plagued your mind. Instead, you will now be able to focus on more complicated situations that will ultimately allow to rise in strength and ability.</p>
<p><em>*If you&#8217;re wondering what qualifies as easy, it means that you can read out all of the variations in your head with minimal effort.</em><br />
<strong>#2. If you use tsumego software, do not get in the habit of just playing things out because you can.</strong><br />
The short version of the rationale for this is that tsumego software permits you to be lazy by letting the software show why something is wrong. This is a habit that will not only fail to help you improve your reading ability, but will deteriorate it instead. For a more detailed explanation on this topic, visit <a title="Tsumego: Books vs. Software" href="//go-problems-books-vs-software/">this post</a>.<br />
<strong>3. If you do not understand why your variation does not work, stop and figure it out before moving on.</strong><br />
Although this piece of advice will be difficult to follow as you grow in strength, this is one of those things that will truly help to fill the void where you are not seeing the issue with your variation. If you take the time to properly understand which counter moves negate your solution, it will serve as a big boost to your abilities over time because you will begin to see variations you could never see before. And if you feel like you&#8217;ve tried everything (even though in reality you haven&#8217;t) and feel strongly that the book is wrong, get a stronger player to help you figure it out. I&#8217;ve done this a number of times and without fail, there was always one variation that I left out.<br />
Well I hope that this will get you on the right path to studying tsumego. If you have anything you&#8217;d like to add from your own experience, please leave a comment and I&#8217;ll be sure to revise the post with ideas that other players can make use of!<br />

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 style="text-align: center;"><em>Weekly Go Wednesday, Issue #4</em></h2>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Tactic #1: The Wedge</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align: center;">Here is a scenario that occurs quite frequently in games.</p>
<p><a href="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2012/10/wedge1.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-243" title="wedge1" src="https://i1.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2012/10/wedge1.png?resize=171%2C200" alt="" width="171" height="200" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>White just played the one point jump. Black to play.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span id="more-17"></span></p>
<p>Trick question. The answer is to tenuki. Nothing beneficial can come out of playing here locally. Leave the aji for later on when it might be useful. (If any stronger players think anything to the contrary, please let me know!)<br />
Up until recently, I was in the camp with the rest of the players who stared at the situation and thought, &#8220;Why don&#8217;t I just wedge in?&#8221; First off, from the reading I&#8217;ve done thus far, the wedge is a tesuji. Secondly, I have read this out thoroughly and I can successfully cut the two groups apart without losing my cutting stone. (See variation below).<br />
<a href="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2012/10/wedge-variations.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-245" title="wedge variations" src="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2012/10/wedge-variations.png?resize=400%2C244" alt="" width="400" height="244" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><br />
While you get brownie points for reading out the variations properly and succeeding in your original goal, there is a one earth shattering reason why this misuse of the tactic will consistently cost you game after game:<br />
<strong>Your opponent gets to choose the variation that results from it.</strong><br />
As you are probably well aware, one of the most critical aspects of go is the sente and gote relationship. As a rule of thumb, players ideally want to keep sente for a majority of the game. The reason for this lies in the fact that you are essentially forcing your opponent to go where you would like him/her to. In other words, you become his/her puppet master!<br />
This type of wedge, while seemingly effective in disconnecting your opponent&#8217;s stones, is the equivalent of handing the reigns of the game over to your opponent and say, &#8220;Pick whichever variation you like! I care not whether or not it benefits me, because I am satisfied knowing I was able to disconnect your stones for the time being!&#8221; And so unless your opponent gives no heed to which variation is to his/her benefit, you&#8217;ll often find yourself in a regrettable situation before you know it.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>So&#8230; when does the wedge make sense?</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2012/10/wedge2.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-246" title="wedge2" src="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2012/10/wedge2.png?resize=156%2C200" alt="" width="156" height="200" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>This new scenario is similar to the original diagram, but there are two differences to take note of. First, white is offered a second one point jump for reinforcement. Secondly, and most importantly, black is much stronger this time around. With this crucial difference, the wedge that was once to white&#8217;s benefit is now a strong weapon for black to use.<br />
<a href="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2012/10/wedge-variations-2.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-247" title="wedge variations 2" src="https://i2.wp.com/bengozen.com//wp-content/uploads/2012/10/wedge-variations-2.png?resize=400%2C263" alt="" width="400" height="263" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><br />
As you can now see, regardless of which variation white chooses, his triangled stones are destined for impending doom.<br />
With the wedge tesuji, the key thing to remember is that your purpose must extend beyond simply cutting off two groups from one another.<br />
After all, which of the following options would you prefer to offer your opponent:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>&#8220;Please, choose a variation that is best suited for your purposes.&#8221;</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>OR</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>&#8220;Your stones could die this way, or that way. Your choice.&#8221;</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Many thanks to fellow ASR member sita for helping me grasp this concept. </em><br />
