				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>So what you&#8217;ll probably notice first is that my rank in this game is a lot lower than you might expect. This is because my OGS rank is super outdated as I never played many games and lost a few games due to time around the time I took a break.</p>
<p><span id="more-6307"></span></p>
<p>That said, it was a blitz game and man I forgot how antsy those made me. I played one previous to this with 10 seconds time and that was one full of mistakes. This one was 30 seconds and also pretty bad, but I thought I would post it nonetheless since there are still things to learn from it. Enjoy!</p>

<p>In blitz go, be prepared to prove you know what you&#8217;re doing because your opponent will test you time and time again&#8230;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 style="text-align: center;">Introduction</h2>
<p>To be honest, I didn&#8217;t expect to release a Monday Go Meditation so quickly; but it seems that the universe had something else in mind. I happened to run across a tweet from <a href="https://twitter.com/thegomovie">@TheGoMovie</a> regarding the Go World Championship final between Park Jeong-Hwan (9p) and Iyama Yuta (9p) that I couldn&#8217;t resist clicking on. Next thing I know, I&#8217;m watching the game and deciding I might as well take the opportunity to comment on it as I watched. Enjoy!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>For this week&#8217;s meditation, we are going to start off nice and easy with a 9&#215;9 game I played on GoQuest a week or so ago. It&#8217;s not too crazy in regards to fighting, but is a great example of how powerful influence can be on such a small board. Hope that you enjoy the game and the commentary!<br />

<h2 style="text-align: left;">One Point Lesson</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Never hesitate to take influence early on when playing on a small board, it is more powerful than you probably realize.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hey everyone. Just wanted to let you know I&#8217;m still alive and well. Been getting into some really interesting projects these past few weeks and have been really pondering what I can do with blogging again since I miss doing it. And as someone who hates it when a regular blogger just drops out of the blogosphere, you can rest assured that I won&#8217;t ever just leave the blog hanging in the event I need to close up shop for awhile.<br />
In terms of what I&#8217;ve been up to, I&#8217;ve been tinkering again with daily regimens and playing games via <a title="Dragon Go Server" href="http://www.dragongoserver.net/">DGS</a> and <a title="Online Go Server" href="http://www.online-go.com/">OGS</a> while concurrently juggling a new job and trying to learn a ton of new skills. I&#8217;ve gone all the way back down to the very basics of doing only 10 life and death problems a day. They&#8217;re not hard in any sense of the word, but they help me to keep a connection to the world of go.<br />
And as a special treat for those who miss my reviews, I&#8217;ve decided to try reviewing one of my 9&#215;9 games that I played recently on GoQuest via an awesome new social kifu reviewing software called <a title="GoKibitz" href="http://www.gokibitz.com/">GoKibitz</a> that a close friend and long time rival built himself. So I hope you enjoy the review and I will try and post again soon!<br />
UPDATE: Apparently all my comments got lost in the abyss of the internet&#8230;. Oy vey&#8230; I&#8217;ll try and get another version up soon&#8230;.<br />

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>For this week&#8217;s go meditation, I am featuring my game from the Pumpkin Classic that I had the pleasure of visiting for a round. This game was an interesting challenge for me since it had been a while since I had played a game in person, let alone play a handicap game. As this is a handicap game where I play White, I hope that my thoughts throughout the game will help you understand better why players sometimes make the moves they do in handicap games. Enjoy!<br />

<h2>One Point Lesson</h2>
<p>When playing as White in a two stone handicap game, don’t try to complicate the game too early. If your opponent punishes your overplays early on, you will have a hard time coming back</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>In today&#8217;s go meditation, I am glad to welcome back fellow friend and go player Bonscott. For those who don&#8217;t remember, I&#8217;ve played a number of even games against Bonscott (even though there is a few stones difference between our ranks) and actually lost quite a few of them before. So when he challenged me to a game recently, I made sure to not underestimate him!<br />
In terms of the game, you&#8217;ll get to see the rather uncommon 3-3 opening. In addition, this is a good game for study in regards to the importance of selecting the correct strategy in conjunction with your opening moves. As you progress through the game, you will notice that Black&#8217;s attempt to shift from territorial to moyo and how it results in a difficult uphill battle for Black.<br />
Finally, in light of Halloween last Friday, I’ve included a fun life and death problem with a pretty detailed variations at the end of the game. Hope that you enjoy this game!<br />

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>For this week’s meditation, we are going to be reviewing my first professional simul game from <a title="Go Congress 2014 — Day 1" href="//go-congress-2014-day-1/">Go Congress</a>! Through this game, you’ll get to witness the enduring strength of professionals in simul games. Even though the game looks overwhelmingly in Black’s advantage for a good portion of the game, it is in the middle game where their precise analysis becomes extremely evident.<br />
In case there are those wondering though, Dahye’s felt that I played well for most of the game; but as you’ll see in the game, an oversight on the security of my own groups was the ultimate reason for my demise. Hope that you enjoy the game!<br />

For those who need a refresher, this game was from the day I arrived in New York and was asked to play a match while we were waiting for people to arrive.

4,Strategy,<strong>Move 101</strong> &#8211; This attachment was the seed that gave me the aji needed to turn the game back in my favor., <strong>Move 51</strong> &#8211; Not approaching the corner showed poor positional judgment.<br />

<p>As the weeks have passed, one of the major factors in me starting to play go again has been the numerous friends who have been kind enough to take time out of their day and ask me to play. Just like last week’s MGM, this week’s MGM features teafree. It’s an exciting one that is chocked full of ko battles and exciting exchanges. I hope that it keeps you on the edge of your seat as we navigate through the treacherous waters of this kifu! Enjoy!<br />

no,Category,Good,Bad<br />
1,Opening, Move 40 &#8211; I like this move since it was dual purpose as reinforcement and an extension.,&#8221;Move 10 &#8211; Though some might say that White ended up okay, I really did not like the result for White.&#8221;<br />
2,Attack and Defense, Nothing worth mentioning., Move 22 &#8211; Neglecting my corner for this pincer is questionable.<br />
3,Shape, N/A, Move 251 &#8211; I did not anticipate the ko shape here.<br />
4,Strategy, Move 146 &#8211; I was proud of being able to switch strategies once I realized my mistake., Move 92 &#8211; This was too greedy on my part and helped Black more than White.<br />
5,Overall Reading, Move 60 &#8211; Being able to discern this move out during the game gave me the advantage early on., Move 210 &#8211; Should have realized Black was already dead.<br />
6,Endgame, Move 262-264 &#8211; This was a nice sequence to capture a bigger corner., Move 286 &#8211; This was a useless connection.<br />

<h2>Prologue</h2>
<p>Hey everyone. I’m glad to finally be able get Monday Go Meditation back up and running again. In a concerted effort to being consistent and making progress one step at a time, here is my revised philosophy on MGM:<br />
For those who remember, I eventually got caught up in trying to make MGM reflective of my actual progress and tried to keep all the game commentary as current as possible. However, I’ve come to learn that this was something I could not keep up with. So rather than abandon the effort all together, I will try and keep the game commentaries as current as I can; but no promises on it being in perfect sync with my actual progress.<br />
With that said, I’m looking forward to your insights on my games and all the great discussions to come!</p>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>The following game is one that I had the pleasure of playing last week thanks for Daurak. I still have some reservations about playing games, so it’s helpful to have friends who ask to play games. And just to clarify, our ranks are not accurate at the moment; so we went ahead and played an even game (although I think we accidentally did no komi).<br />
Hope you enjoy the game!<br />

no,Category,Good,Bad<br />
1,Opening,<strong>Move 19</strong> &#8211; Recognizing the big point was critical in gaining the upper hand in the moyo race.,<strong>Move 39</strong> &#8211; This was too greedy. I should have just enclosed the corner.<br />
2,Attack and Defense, <strong>Move 99</strong> &#8211; Getting this allowed me to get the attack needed to maintain my lead., Nothing glaring as far as I can tell.<br />
3,Shape,<strong>Move 47</strong> &#8211; This move I made purely from shape knowledge.,<strong>Move 93</strong> &#8211; I wonder if there’s a better response; but I ended up with bad shape after the peep.<br />
4,Strategy, Overall I felt I was pretty consistent for the game.,<strong>Move 39</strong> &#8211; Must be reiterated for its greediness.<br />
5,Overall Reading,<strong>Move 129-133</strong> &#8211; Reading out the aji was a proud moment for me.,<strong>Move 58-69</strong> &#8211; I didn’t realized White would be able to connect so easily.<br />
6,Endgame, N/A, N/A<br />
