		<description><![CDATA[I noticed that you said you needed to &quot;re-discipline my reading abilities&quot;.  If you want a good way to get better at reading, then I recommend the first two volumes ofThe bother range from 5 kyu-3 dan, though most problems are rated as dan level problems.  One goes over tesuji, the other life and death.  I&#039;ve done the tesuji one, and I think its a great way to improve your reading, especially since, in my case at least, I was able to apply a lot of the tesuji to my games faster than I thought I would.  The life and death book has the same benefits, not to mention how the help you read faster and more accurately.]]></description>
