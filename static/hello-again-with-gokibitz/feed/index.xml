		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve never heard of &quot;Beauty and the Beast,&quot; you&#039;ll have to let me know how you like it!
In terms of the 9x9, I definitely would see value for seeing what the computer would do versus a human; but I was speaking in terms of simply being able to play more games since they are so quick and then you can review them afterwards with much more ease (as opposed to a 19x19 board).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi, Master -
Good point! The feedback loop playing 9 x 9 would be quite fast. It would seem reviewing computer analysis for the &#039;best move&#039; versus whatever the poor human played would add to the learning - similar to what is common in chess these days? Along with my reading/visualization studies I am also working through Beauty and the Beast by Shen Guosun (a little beyond me) and Fundamental Principles of Go by Yilun Yang (just about my speed).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hmm.. I haven&#039;t looked at whether there are attributes to configure that, but I do think that I would probably need to update the design of the blog (which is definitely on my mind) to be able to accommodate the full screen implementation of GoKibitz.
Glad to start making my way back! Haha. Hope that all is well with you!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Love the GoKibitz integration, but I was curious if there is a way to have the comments displayed to the right of the board (similar to how it looks on gokibitz.com).  While it&#039;s not a big deal, I can either see the board or the comments.  Glad to see you posting again to =)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hey Molokai! You sure know how to make my laugh. Haha.
And to your point, yes computers have pretty much figured out 9x9. On the other hand though, most of us human players have yet to do so; which allows for quick and fun sparring via apps like GoQuest. So while it does have the benefit of forcing players into fighting and testing reading ability, the biggest appeal to me has definitely been the short time frame it can be played in.]]></description>
