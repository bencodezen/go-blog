		<description><![CDATA[That means a lot coming from you man. I actually thought my whole board ended up pretty wacky for that game; but perhaps I am being my own worst critic.
frozensoul is my sensei. Haha. And yes it is a he (who is in high school for that matter xD). But in all honesty, I am glad to have found someone who matches my style after trying out many different teaching styles. =D]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[It was an intense game. I&#039;m not sure whether to be grateful that most of my games are a little less intense, or to wish that they were because you definitely push me to try to play my absolute best game. I can&#039;t deny that I&#039;m proud and relieved to have won a game that wasn&#039;t due to a last-minute miracle - I have immense respect for your whole-board thinking and your attacking ability.
Is frozensoul your sensei? He (?) is really cool - he was generous enough to stick around after our game and give me a lot of comments in review. You&#039;re really lucky to have found someone like that to teach you.]]></description>
