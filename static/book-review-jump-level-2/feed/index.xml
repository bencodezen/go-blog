		<description><![CDATA[So the answers to the Level Up Series is found via a series of PDF&#039;s. If you have trouble locating them, let me know and I can email them to you. (It&#039;s not copyrighted or anything in regards to this aspect. They are meant to be freely distributed.) And in regards to the Jump Level Series, they actually have an answer book you can purchase from them or from YMImports.
Glad you enjoyed this week&#039;s MGM! It&#039;s always motivating to get some validation for my hard work. =)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Looked into these and the Level Up books awhile ago but was a little befuddled about where the answers to the problems are, separate books an online source or door number three?  From the reviews I&#039;ve read they sound really good though.
Enjoyed the Monday match commentary.  Cool game.]]></description>
