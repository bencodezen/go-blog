		<description><![CDATA[I am in Singapore, GMT+8. Yes, please send me your SGF file asap. I have a team of players here who are able to do the review as well. They are local Weiqi teachers about 5 Dan strength. We usually meet for game reviews once every week. My email is &quot;benson@winpro.com.sg&quot;. Hope we can improve from here. :)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Sounds like a great idea! Hmm.... in terms of getting this to work, first thing is first. What time zone are you in? I&#039;m on EST. So if there&#039;s a big difference in time, something we could do is I could send you my review via email, and then you can add comments via a third person&#039;s perspective and then we&#039;ll do a cleanup and that will be the final review. Thoughts?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks! I agree with you about utilizing more conscious efforts in order to produce results as opposed to just trying to &quot;punch the clock.&quot; I mean if I had all the time in the world or was a student, maybe I&#039;d try that route; but it&#039;s just not realistic for me at this time. Haha.
I will be sure to check it out! Thanks for recommending it!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Great post! I agree 100% and have been trying to focus on this as well. I think that it can be easy to fall into the 10,000 hours to become an expert (popularized by Malcolm Gladwell, not sure who first came up with it) and head down the path if just punching the clock if you will, but I think that more thoughtful/conscious efforts yield better results.
I thought the book The Talent Code was great for this line if thinking. ]]></description>
