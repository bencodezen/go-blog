		<description><![CDATA[I wouldn&#039;t worry about the rank estimation. Unless people play consistently for the last 40 games, it seems that it has a lot of wiggle room in regards to its standard deviation of error.
I&#039;m glad to hear that it&#039;s making you want to play more! I&#039;m debating a similar idea myself! Only I think that I think the studying side of me may win out since I have sooo many books to read and review. xD]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This is very cool.  I think it underestimated my rank at 10-14 kyu, but I haven&#039;t been playing enough lately for it to get a good read ... and I just got over a habit of losing games I&#039;d already won, so...
On the other hand, I&#039;d just come to the same conclusion as the main suggestion it gave me about my biggest fault right now (not giving actual thought to sente through most of the game).
The best thing is, it makes me want to play more games to give it a more recent sample pool to draw from so I can get a more accurate reading, which is the hallmark of the best tools of all: they make you want to use them!]]></description>
