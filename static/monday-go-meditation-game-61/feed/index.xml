		<description><![CDATA[I can totally attest to trying to learn things through osmosis. There&#039;s just so much to learn one can only hope that the knowledge will naturally absorb after exposure to so much. Haha.
If your chess experience yields any new tricks along your journey for making studying/training more effective and you don&#039;t mind sharing, I would love to hear your ideas! Best of luck man!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thank you, Ben! When I know enough to ask an intelligent question I will surely do so!
Right now I am mostly thinking about how to learn the game while casually studying some books (Takagawa, Graded Go Problems, So You Want to Play Go), reading through old issues of Go World,your Commentaries, etc). I am hoping some sort of learning framework will come to me by osmosis. :)
 I want to use (if possible) knowledge I gained about learning from my chess experience.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[You&#039;re totally right about the two spaced pincer. Definitely did not handle that properly. Should have just connected.
The lower left definitely took a while to get to, but I couldn&#039;t bring myself to choose a direction until the time I did. Perhaps I was wrong to wait so long though.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Brilliant! Great learning experience for me, thank you Ben. When I have more time I will replay this one several more times. I feel I had the thread of things to about move 60, then it sort of came unglued. But these are very excellent commentaries, indeed!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Move 16 isn&#039;t correct for the two space high pincer.  Maybe we can chat about it on KGS later, but you can check a joseki resource on that one.  I think Inseong has talked about it a couple times in reviews but not commonly.
It feels like both of you left the lower left too long, but it&#039;s hard to say.  As black, I would have played F4 at move 9.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Well 2 weeks is the maximum age that they would be. After all, it takes a lot of time to review these games. Of course I&#039;ll try to keep it within a week, but I didn&#039;t want to promise something I couldn&#039;t keep.
The interesting thing is that I realized I recently acquired the ability to replay most of my games afterwards from memory (for the most part). So that is something that I do sometimes to keep the skill in check.
Glad you enjoyed the game and looking forward to your comments!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Good idea Ben, I think 2 weeks is a bit to long, but still for improvement at Go its better to check ur own mistakes asap, to see what u fight for :D
another thing ive heard/read about it is to learn ur game and replay it few times so u can put it on goban most of time.
I will comment game for both side, and send it to Ben via mail, if he wants to he can post it here, I don&#039;t wanna put here a wall of text, especially its not always easy to read and check it :)
I really liked this game, cause was a bit different than all so far.]]></description>
