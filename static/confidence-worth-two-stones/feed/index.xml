		<description><![CDATA[Good suggestions. I think in all honesty, it&#039;s tough to estimate one&#039;s own strength since there are other factors that have to be taken in as well. Example, your play style might be very effective against mine. That could definitely alter the balance. =D So I think I&#039;ll be taking a page from your book from now on: &quot;Only one way to find out! Let&#039;s play!&quot; xD]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[As always it&#039;s about balance.
Prancing around trash-talking, isn&#039;t true self confidence, and will be recognised as false. And saying &quot;Oh no I&#039;m really weak&quot;  doesn&#039;t work when you&#039;re a couple of stones stronger than your opponent.   I&#039;d prefer to go for something non-committal - like &quot;It may be closer than you think&quot; or &quot;there&#039;s one way to  find out - lets play...&quot;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Well said! I definitely think there is something to be said for &quot;fighting spirit&quot; and assert yourself to your opponents. Certainly something that should not be overlooked!
And in regards to things we&#039;ve said in the past, I am just as guilty for doing the very same things. So I apologize to you as well! Let us move forward and continue playing the best go that we can!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I think self-deprecation can frequently be a trap, and it&#039;s one I&#039;ve been prone to for a long time, though I&#039;ve tried to ameliorate the tendency a bit. For me, Hikaru no Go has been helpful in finding better language for confidence: it&#039;s not that I want to go around sure that I will win. Instead, I want to show *fighting spirit* - to assert myself and force my opponent to cut off my head if he wants to kill me (to borrow a phrase from Sai&#039;s second game with Akira). Thinking of games this way has helped me learn how to deal better with losing and to relish the chance to play a game against someone stronger.
I play some of my best go these days against Shifu, because I feel confident that he&#039;ll ultimately destroy me, but I relish the chance to force him to treat me as an opponent who can be dangerous.
I&#039;ve displayed some of my old bad habits in the past with you, pitying myself for getting killed and arguing that you&#039;re better, which is total bull shit. I apologize! Far better to smile broadly and say, &quot;Do your best! I know I will. Let&#039;s fight!&quot;]]></description>
