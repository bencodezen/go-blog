		<description><![CDATA[Thanks Devin! Appreciate it! Definitely makes all the time I put into it worth it.
Your question made me laugh. Haha. But I didn&#039;t play against any 1 kyus in the tournament, so I don&#039;t think I&#039;m &quot;First Kyu&quot; quite yet. =D]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m glad that my hours of hard work were worth it!
And though I should really practice recreating my games, I recorded them while playing in order to ensure I could provide the most comprehensive experience on my posts.
However, I think that it would be a good exercise in the future to try and recreate afterwards (without referring to my source file).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks for putting in the immense effort it took to present your experience with such vividness. The screenshots from Hikaru no Go, the game records, the photographs, and certainly not least the description of your thoughts and feelings through it all. That&#039;s great, man.
Did you record your games while you were playing, or have you just gotten awesome at being able to reconstruct them afterward?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks Husain! When you resign, the way I do it (and have seen other people do it) is that they get their opponent&#039;s attention to make eye contact and then acknowledge &quot;I resign.&quot;
Another way I&#039;ve heard of is to put two stones down on the board at the same time, but I&#039;ve never seen this done in a tournament setting yet.]]></description>
