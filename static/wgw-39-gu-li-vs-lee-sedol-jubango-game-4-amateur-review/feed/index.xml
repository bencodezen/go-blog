		<description><![CDATA[Thank you!
The position at Move 27 is certainly a rich topic at that. I did notice An Youngill&#039;s commentary regarding the reason professionals consider it equal, but in terms of an amateur player (particularly kyu players), I would have to say that most kyu players would probably not be able to use the White thickness properly.
But you&#039;re absolutely right in his explanation being an eye opener. I still don&#039;t quite understand it fully, but it just goes to show how deep go can really be.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Nice review :)
The position after move 26 has created some amusing commentary and may be used to understand the differences in positional judgement between pros and amateurs -
Or, more precisely, after move 27 (since obviously black has to defend there)
It has been discussed on several forums, and even several very strong high dan level amateurs were saying it&#039;s good for black for the same reasons stated above.
Of course (though not being high dan yet... :(   ), I was sharing the same thoughts... However,
Professional analysis of the same position seems to claim the position is even. And claimed that both during the game and after more in-depth analysis afterwards.
Intrigued - I looked deeper.
In the end, I found An Youngill&#039;s commentary on GoGameguru, where he gives a more in-depth explanation of the reasons why professionals consider that position as equal. It is truly worthwhile seeing :) Discusses the effects on white&#039;s strong position on the bottom, on the lower left corner, on black&#039;s bottom and on later game tempo...
It&#039;s still hard for me, even after reading all of his explanations, but it&#039;s somewhat of an eye opener...]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Ah I see the confusion.
&quot;But Black needs to respond in order to prevent White from getting a ponnuki in the center, which would significantly reduce Black&#039;s potential in the center.&quot;
I&#039;ll change that in the kifu. Thanks!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi
Move 111 has bit confusing commentary
But Black responds in order to prevent White from getting a ponnuki in the center and wiping out most of Black&#039;s potential in the center.
So black responds to prevent white&#039;s ponukki, WHICH could wipe most of black&#039;s potential in the center?
Thx. Marek]]></description>
