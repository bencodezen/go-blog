		<description><![CDATA[I think at the time my co-worker was speaking more in terms of the complexities of individual pieces. After thinking about it for some time, I realized that people who haven&#039;t played go don&#039;t realize that the complexity with go does not lie in single pieces; but the overarching connections and dynamic value that changes as the game progresses.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The key is indeed in that the rules themselves are essentially drop-dead simple: but also that the emergent tactical and strategic considerations move FAR beyond that underlying rule-based simplicity.
Chess simply cannot compare. It was _made_ more complex long ago, simply to &#039;jazz it up&#039;, AFAIC.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[It seems the chinese go proverb, &quot;two siblings shouldn&#039;t fight for the same road&quot;, and, &quot;winning all the battles can lose the war&quot; are constantly violated in this debate!
Two can either beg for the crumbs and put the other down in order to be given more (&quot;Who the heck plays X!&quot;, &quot;A is OBVIOUSLY superior to B&quot;) or work together (World mind Games).

		<description><![CDATA[Still here Molokai! Just busy off in code world and training myself in other disciplines. It certainly would be fantastic if my training pays off in go as well; but I won&#039;t hold my breath! Haha.
Interesting question! I believe the basic answer to your question is best represented by trying to live in the corner of the board. Generally speaking, the 3-3 is the guaranteed invasion that will allow life. Beyond that, there are probably some extraneous scenarios where life by ko is possible; but otherwise I imagine it&#039;s not possible. Just my small two cents though.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Are you still with us, Master? Studying hard and coming back as 7d? :) I recall Bobby Fischer&#039;s &#039;suddenly I got good&#039; comment when he went from ELO 2103 in July 1957 to 2722 in December 1957. I think that would be equivalent to going from 1d-2d to 7p-8p (chess ratings have inflated apx 200 points in the past 40 years according to some studies).
I have a Go question for you also, please: Has any study been done of something like this: Given a fully enclosed area of &#039;x&#039; empty points - in which areas can the opposing player build a live group? It would seem a computer could do this up to perhaps 20-25 points in any regular or irregular shape fairly easily?]]></description>
