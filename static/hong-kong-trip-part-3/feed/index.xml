		<description><![CDATA[That&#039;s a wonderful experience! I have that same magnetic go board. I put it in my purse when I go to a particular buffet restaurant for lunch. I&#039;ll eat, then set up the board and replay a pro game or work on life and death problems. A waitress stopped to look, and was very effusive, saying that she used to play with her brother many years ago. It was a real thrill to her to see someone playing.  We talked as long as she could spare some time.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thank you! I have also heard that the one with the sketchy entrance has a playing area too, but it seems activities have been moved over to this new area.
That&#039;s awesome that you got a chance to play some locals! I would have loved to have that experience as well. Haha.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Nice story! I was actually in HK around New Years and had a similar experience. I found the website and ended up going to that first location (the one on central). I had some reservations about that sketchy entrance, but decided to go in anyway. There actually was a playing area there and a lot of booketc., albeit not as big as that other place you went to (which I didn&#039;t know existed lol). I was worried that there would be only old people like in japan, but luckily there were a couple of people a my age and I got two games in. It was a lot of fun! That lesson sure sounds nice though...]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Awesome experience!  It reminds me of the go proverb - &quot;use go to meet friends&quot; - http://senseis.xmp.net/?UseGoToMeetFriends
For me, go has been a great way to meet new people and have a lot of fun :)

		<description><![CDATA[You&#039;re welcome! I&#039;m glad that you enjoyed it!
Yeah I really wish I had the whole kifu, but we just didn&#039;t have enough time for me to copy down the moves though. In the future however, I need to make sure I at least take a picture of the final result. That&#039;s better than nothing in my opinion.]]></description>
