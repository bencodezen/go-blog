		<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s essentially a hero based game that&#039;s very team reliant. Sort of like capture the flag except with lots of different heroes to choose from. Obviously with the vast number of heroes and different builds available, team dynamics play a big role in how the game turns out. Let me know how you like it!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[No real idea what I&#039;m signing up for, besides that it&#039;s a strategy rich multiplayer game, but I named you as dragging me into it so you get some sort of credit for getting me to try this thing out.;) (Edit: sadly it&#039;s not finding you by your summoner name  Ah well.)]]></description>
