		<description><![CDATA[Thanks Sphaso! And what a perfect reference to Aji&#039;s Quest! It definitely helps to be reminded of the social interactions and joy that can come out of go instead of always being caught up in simply trying to get stronger. Hope that all is well with you!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This is your best posting ever.  Really, it is superb and I sincerely thank you for it.  By the way, a couple tournaments back I was paired to play with a little boy in Kindegarten, only 5 1/2 years old.  Of course I initially &quot;took it easy on him&quot; but in short order he both ignored my purposeful errors, played his own game, and totally destroyed me.  I don&#039;t know if I am that bad or if very young boy is &quot;that good&quot;?  This child beat me on a 19 x 19 board, his very 1st tournament, and ended up winning 3 of his 4 games.  I thought maybe the chicken place had slipped drugs into my lunch!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks! I&#039;m not quite out of the woods yet, but it feels like things should start getting better. And pish posh on your last statement, it shouldn&#039;t change anything. Challenge away!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;d love to hear more about how you think go should be taught. It seems to me that every time I try I end up either getting them to play a game too early, which just ends up confusing them, or going through too much theory first and boring them. :- ]]></description>
