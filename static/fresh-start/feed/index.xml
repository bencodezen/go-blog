		<description><![CDATA[Very good idea! Great post.
I had a game yesterday against black player, he starts at tengen and everytime i played a 4/4 he invaded san san ;-p very strange... in the end i lost the game. I thought... why not try it out next time myself this fuseki?! Why not experiment more, we have nothing to loose only 1 or two stones rank... but that is not important isn&#039;t it?!
The board is open and wide we can try out new things when ever we want :) ]]></description>
