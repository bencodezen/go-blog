		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m with you on that. In fact, you&#039;ll probably empathize with my post later on today. Definitely not doing as well with correspondence games as I would probably have done in a real time game.
I like your advice on not needing to know where your opponent last played. =) That&#039;s something I plan on writing on in the future too, so I&#039;m glad I&#039;m not the only one who thinks it.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I think my biggest problem is I don&#039;t give as much time to a move on nova.gs as I would in a real game. You figure you&#039;ll check for moves, do a bunch in your 3 games and off you go, only to look back and realize you didn&#039;t even correctly read your opponents initial response.
I think the advice about knowing the last stone played is good here. Someone said that you don&#039;t need to know which stone your opponent just played because you should be reading the board and looking at what you need to defend and where you can attack.]]></description>
