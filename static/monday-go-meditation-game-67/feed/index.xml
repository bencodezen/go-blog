		<description><![CDATA[I decided to download your sgf file so I could view your game in Smart Go Kifu. I found that since I was viewing the blog on my iPad I was given a choice of the app to use to view the file when I tapped on the link to download. Smart Go Kifu was one of the choices. After I got the file into the app I viewed it in the book view. It was really nice to review that way especially because you comment on every move in the game. I did a screen capture of one of the pages and sent it to you via email.]]></description>
